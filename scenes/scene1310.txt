Yung says: "What's going on? Who are you?"
Korra says: "I'm the Avatar, and I'm getting you all out of here."
Tenzin says: "Everyone, please! You must stay calm and quiet if we want this to work."
Yung says: "What to work?  We're sneaking out?"
Korra says: "Yes, and we must leave now."
Tenzin says: "We're going to get you away from the Earth Queen and out of the city."
Yung says: "There's an airbender that's not here. His name is Kai. We need to get him."
Tenzin says: "We're already taking care of it."
Bumi says: "Topside, this is Papa Bear. The breezies are in the hold; cue the balloons!"
Lin says: "What? Are you in trouble?"
Bumi says: "No! We've got the airbenders and we're headed out!  No one likes code names anymore."
Lin says: "Copy that. Asami and I are on our way."
