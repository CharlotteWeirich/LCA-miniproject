Bolin says: "Don't ... torture us."
Kuvira says: "Send these three away on the next train. Bolin and Zhu Li will be going to the reeducation camp for our most severe dissenters.  And you will continue work on the spirit-energy project, under close, armed supervision. I want it weaponized immediately."
Zhu Li says: "Please! Have mercy on me! Don't send me away! Take me back!"
Kuvira says: "Why would I?"
Zhu Li says: "Because my only mistake was being loyal to the wrong person. I was blindly devoted to Varrick, and I looked past all the times he ridiculed me, or ordered me around, or made me clean his disgusting feet--  --because I thought he possessed the most brilliant mind in the world. But when I met you, I realized I was wrong. Compared to you, Varrick's a fool."
Varrick says: "Hey, come on! I'm right here!"
Zhu Li says: "I believe in everything you've done, and I believe in your vision. I want to devote my life to you. I pledge my allegiance to you, Great Uniter."
Kuvira says: "You two could learn something from her. Rise, Zhu Li. I'll give you another chance."
Varrick says: "Think about what you're doing! We're partners! We have history!"
Zhu Li says: "I did everything you ever asked of me, and you never appreciated it!  Guards, do the thing!"
Varrick says: "No! Not the thing! Zhu Li!"
