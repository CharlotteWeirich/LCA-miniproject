May says: "Did you say something to her?"
Jim says: "Me? You're the one with the big mouth!"
Iroh says: "Korra, please stop! Look at what you're doing to everyone!"
Korra says: "I did that?"
Iroh says: "In the Spirit World, your emotions become your reality- especially for the Avatar, because you are the bridge between the two worlds. You must try to stay positive."
Korra says: "I'm sorry."
Iroh says: "There, you see?"
Korra says: "I can make the sun shine?"
Iroh says: "Even in the material world, you will find that if you look for the light, you can often find it. But if you look for the dark,  that is all you will ever see."
Korra says: "I'm looking for my friend. I want her here now!  Why didn't she come out like the sun?"
Iroh says: "I'm afraid finding her won't be so easy."
Korra says: "But what am I supposed to do?"
Iroh says: "Sometimes the best way to solve your own problems is to help someone else.  This little fellow needs to go home as well. Maybe if you help him find his friends, you will be able to find yours."
Korra says: "I'll take him home! Where do I go?"
Iroh says: "The dragon bird nest is located there, at the top of Hai-Riyo Peak."
