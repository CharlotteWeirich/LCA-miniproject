Lin says: "My metalbenders are on their way to Amon, and it's all my fault. Tarrlok's right, I've failed as chief. First thing in the morning, I'm handing in my resignation."
Tenzin says: "No! You can't give up like this!"
Lin says: "I'm not giving up. I'm gonna find my officers and take Amon down. But I'm gonna do it my way, outside the law."
Mako says: "I'm sorry I didn't believe you. But Asami's dad being an Equalist is not an easy thing to believe. Even now."
Korra says: "I know. I'm sorry this whole thing happened."
Mako says: "So ... does your offer to live in the Air Temple still stand?"
Korra says: "Of course it does. And Asami's welcome, too."
Mako says: "Thank you so much."
Korra says: "After everything she's been through, she's going to need you, Mako."
