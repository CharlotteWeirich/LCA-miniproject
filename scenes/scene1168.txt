Bumi says: "And so, we bring the net down on  the head pirate, and he looks around real sad and says,  "I knew I should have followed my dreams and become a dentist.""
Yung says: "How come you grow up to be so cool, while Tenzin became  such a stick-in-the-mud?"
Bumi says: "Well, I guess cool is something you're born with."
Tenzin says: "Bumi, can I talk to you?"
Bumi says: "Let me guess, you want to criticize me for something?"
Tenzin says: "Actually, I need your help."
Bumi says: "Oh yeah. With what?"
Tenzin says: "I don't think I'm doing well with the new airbenders, and everyone knows you're a natural leader."
Bumi says: "True, I did win the Admiral Tung Natural Leadership Award, twice."
Tenzin says: "What would you do if you were in charge? Help me be more like you."
Bumi says: "I'd love to.  You've got to use military discipline to whip these troops into shape. The only way to deal with new recruits is to  break them down so you can  build them back up. Rule with an iron fist.  Show them who the master is."
Tenzin says: "Thanks for the insight."
Bumi says: "My pleasure."
