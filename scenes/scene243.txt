Wan says: "Come on, let me in, just for a little while."
Aye-aye spirit says: "No! Go back to your lion turtle."
Wan says: "Believe me, I'd love to go back home. But I can't. I was kicked out."
Friendly spirit #1 says: "That's too bad."
Friendly spirit #2 says: "Poor human."
Aye-aye spirit says: "Don't pity him. He's just like every other human: ugly, destructive, and lacking any respect for nature."
Wan says: "Who are you calling ugly, Ugly?"
Aye-aye spirit says: "Mmm."
Friendly spirit #1 says: "If you can't go back to your city, then you should go live in another one."
Wan says: "What? There are other lion turtles?"
Aye-aye spirit says: ""There are other lion turtles?"  Of course there are,  dozens of them! Boy, you humans are stupid, too."
Wan says: "So which way to the nearest lion turtle city?"
Aye-aye spirit says: "Hmm. I think it's on the other side of none-of-your-business valley."
Wan says: "Real funny. You know what? I don't need your help. I'll find it myself."
