Hiroshi Sato says: "It is a glorious day, my Equalist brothers and sisters! Amon has torn down the tyrannical bending government!  He has declared bending illegal,  and he has the Avatar on the run.  Our great leader has a vision for the future. One day soon, bending will no longer exist and we will live in a world where everyone is finally equal! The United Forces are on their way right now to try and stop that dream. But we will prevail!"
