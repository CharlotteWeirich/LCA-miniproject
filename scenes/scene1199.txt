Pema says: "All I want is one child like me,  a nice non-bender, who doesn't  blast wind in my face every five seconds."
Meelo says: "Mommy, look,  I'm a snowbender!"
Pema says: "Were Tenzin and his siblings this crazy when they were kids?"
Katara says: "Kya and Bumi certainly were, but  Tenzin has always been ...  rather serious."
Tenzin says: "Mother, please."
Tenzin says: "Korra?  Look at you, so big and strong.  You've grown into quite the young Avatar."
Korra says: "Master Tenzin, I'm so glad you're here. I can't wait to get started."
Tenzin says: "Yes, well ..."
Pema says: "You're going to have to tell her sooner or later."
Korra says: "Tell me what?"
Katara says: "You're not staying, are you?"
Tenzin says: "I'm afraid not. We're only visiting for the night. Then I have to return to Republic City."
Korra says: "But ... no, you're supposed to move here.  You're supposed to teach me."
Tenzin says: "I'm sorry, Korra. Your airbending training is going to have to wait."
