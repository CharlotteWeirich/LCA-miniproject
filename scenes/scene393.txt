Korra says: "I'm so sorry to interrupt, but more airships are coming."
Ikki says: "Everything's not gonna be fine, is it, Daddy?"
Korra says: "What do you want to do, Tenzin?"
Tenzin says: "I need to protect my family, and get them as far away from this conflict as possible. If Amon got his hands on my children ... I hate to even think of it."
Lin says: "If you're leaving, then I'm going with you."
Tenzin says: "But-"
Lin says: "No arguments. You and your family are the last airbenders. There's no way in the world I'm letting Amon take your bending away."
Tenzin says: "Thank you, Lin. Korra, I want you to leave this island and hide for the time being."
Korra says: "I'm not giving up."
Tenzin says: "I'm not asking you to. I sent word to the United Forces. They will be here soon. And once my family is safe, I will return. With the reinforcements, we can turn the tide in this war."
Korra says: "What you're saying is, we need to be patient."
Tenzin says: "You're learning well.  Stay safe, Korra."
Korra says: "You too."
Lin says: "Tenzin, if we're leaving, we'd better do it now."
Tenzin says: "Oogi, yip yip!"
White Lotus sentry #1 says: "Go! We'll hold them off!"
Korra says: "Everyone, climb on!  Let's go, girl!"
Bolin says: "Mustache guy!"
Korra says: "Nice one, Naga!"
