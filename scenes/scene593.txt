Tu says: "Thanks for getting us out of there. I mean, I probably could have handled it myself if you guys didn't show up, but, thanks."
Yin says: "May she rest in peace.  This airship is nice. Is it our new home?"
Mako says: "No, Grandma. I'm not sure where we're gonna take you, but right now, we need to find Korra."
Chow says: "Did something happen to the Avatar?"
Mako says: "I'm afraid so.  Her airship went down somewhere in the desert. She was coming from a military base near the Misty Palms Oasis and heading to Ba Sing Se. If we retrace her route back to the base, we should find the wreckage."
