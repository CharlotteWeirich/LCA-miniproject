Mako says: "Morning, Narook. My brother here?  Thanks.  Come on. Wake up. Taking you home, bro."
Bolin says: "Don't call me that. You're not my brother! You're a brother betrayer!  The only one I can trust anymore is Pabu! Pabu loves me."
Mako says: "You're a mess, and we've got the biggest match of our lives tonight. Let's go."
Bolin says: "No! I'm not going anywhere with you, you traitor!"
Mako says: "Guess we'll have to do this the hard way."
Bolin says: "Why?"
Mako says: "Told you dating a teammate was a bad idea."
Bolin says: "You're a bad idea! Put me down! Put me down!"
