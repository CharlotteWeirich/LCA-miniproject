Korra says: "So, how long until you're ready to teach me airbending?  A week? A month?"
Tenzin says: "It could be much longer."
Korra says: "I don't understand. Why are you making me wait?"
Tenzin says: "I have a responsibility to Republic City. I am one of its leaders, and the situation there is very unstable right now."
Korra says: "But you also have a responsibility to teach me.  Believe me, I'd be happy to find another airbending master, but you're the only one.  We're stuck with each other."
Tenzin says: "I wish there were another way."
Korra says: "Wait, there is! If you can't stay here, then I'll go back to Republic City with you! It's perfect!"
White Lotus leader says: "Absolutely not!  The city is far too dangerous. Avatar Aang tasked us with keeping you safe while you mastered the four elements."
Korra says: "I get that, but I don't think keeping me locked up in this compound like a prisoner is what he had in mind."
Tenzin says: "I know this is difficult to accept, but it's not the right time for you to come to the city."
Korra says: "Whatever."
