Tenzin says: "Now that you're bonded with Raava once again, are you also reconnected with your past lives?"
Korra says: "No. I think that link is gone, forever."
Tenzin says: "I see. Why don't you close the portals, and we'll go home."
Korra says: "Maybe I shouldn't."
Tenzin says: "What do you mean?"
Korra says: "What if Unalaq was right when he said the Avatar shouldn't be a bridge between the two worlds?  What if Avatar Wan made a mistake when he closed the portals?  What if humans and spirits weren't meant to live apart?  Well, what do you think I should do?"
Tenzin says: "I think you should trust your instincts. There is nothing else I can teach you. You are the Avatar. Whatever your decision, I support you."
