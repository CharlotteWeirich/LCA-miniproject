Kai says: "Jinora?"
Jinora says: "It worked!"
Kai says: "How are you here right now?"
Jinora says: "Shh, quiet. It's a high-level airbender move. With a little spiritual stuff thrown in."
Kai says: "At first, for a second there, I thought you were a ghost."
Jinora says: "It's good to see you. We've been looking for you and the other airbenders. We're going to get you all out of here. Where are we anyway?"
Kai says: "Underground somewhere. Other than that, I don't have a clue."
Jinora says: "I'll figure it out. Don't worry."
Kai says: "Jinora!  Thanks."
Jinora says: "The Earth Queen's Temple!"
