Bolin says: "I think Lin is mad about something."
Lin says: "Su, it's time we talk."
Suyin says: "After thirty years, you're finally ready to talk?"
Lin says: "When we were in Mom's office that day, you could've taken responsibility for what you did. But instead, you stayed quiet and let Mom throw her whole career away."
Suyin says: "Mom didn't throw her career away. She retired the next year. She was a hero."
Lin says: "You think she wanted to retire? She was so guilt-ridden about what she did to protect you that she didn't feel worthy of her badge."
Suyin says: "Look, I admit that I was not a perfect kid and I've made some mistakes in the past but-"
Lin says: "You made some mistakes?"
Suyin says: "Lin, Mom and I already talked about this years ago and worked things out. If you had gotten together with us like we'd asked, you would know that I'm a different person now. I've been a different person for a long time."
Lin says: "You think that just because you live in a big, fancy house, and have a chef who cooks you fancy food, that you're a different person? Maybe you could fool everyone else, but you can't fool me. I see right through you."
Suyin says: "You know what, Lin? You're the one who hasn't changed. You're still a bitter loner who only cares about herself. No wonder Tenzin ended things with you years ago."
Suyin says: "Okay,  I guess this is how it's going to be."
Korra says: "Should I stop them?"
Bolin says: "You don't have any siblings, fighting is all part of the healing process."
Wei says: "Go Mom!"
Huan says: "My sculpture!  Actually, it looks ... kinda better now."
Suyin says: "You've got it out of your system?"
Lin says: "Not quite yet!"
Opal says: "What are you two doing?! You're sisters! Why would you want to hurt each other?"
