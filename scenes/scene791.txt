Varrick says: "Okay, I guess we should've opened with that line."
Bolin says: "Listen to me. Kuvira's making this thing that goes  I don't know how it works, but it has this"
Varrick says: "It's a super weapon! Like a regular weapon, only super."
Korra says: "And let me guess: it has something to do with spirit vines."
Varrick says: "Yes! How did you know?"
Korra says: "I saw a vision of her taking spirit vines from the swamp."
Varrick says: "If she figures out how to harness their power, we are all doomed."
Raiko says: "She might use the weapon to attack Republic City. The only way to protect ourselves is with a preemptive strike."
Tenzin says: "My airbenders won't be part of an unprovoked attack!"
Izumi says: "Neither will the Fire Nation."
Raiko says: "But, Fire Lord Izumi, Kuvira is a threat to the world! She has to be stopped!"
Izumi says: "The Fire Nation has spent too much of its history  fighting nonsense wars.  And I refuse to drag my nation into another one  unless there is no other choice.  If you attack Kuvira, you'll do it without my army."
Raiko says: "Fine. I'll hold off any plans of attack. We'll go on the defensive and fortify security on the borders."
Izumi says: "In that,  you'll have my help."
