Kuvira says: "It's time to go. We're not wanted here."
Bolin says: "What happened?"
Kuvira says: "It appears we can't make a deal right now."
Kai says: "Wait! Aren't you guys going to stick around and help?"
Kuvira says: "Here's the contract. We'll wait at the border for one day. You get the governor to sign it, and you'll have all the help you need."
Bolin says: "I guess ... I got to go."
Opal says: "Don't! Please, you can't turn your back on these people!"
Bolin says: "I'm not! I wanna help, but if the Governor wants us gone, there's ... there's nothing I can do. I'm sorry.  Hey ... Opal, please."
Opal says: "Leave, if that's what you're going to do."
Kai says: "You know, we might not need their help after all. The roads may be impassable, but not the skies. We can use Lefty to fly to all the nearby villages, pick up supplies, and fly back."
Opal says: "You're right. We can save this town ourselves."
