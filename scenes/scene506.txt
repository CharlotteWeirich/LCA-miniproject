Bolin says: "Yeah!"
Asami says: "Aren't you coming?"
Lin says: "What's there to see? It's metal. Big whoop. Just find the airbender and let's get moving. Don't tell anyone I'm here."
Korra says: "Why not?"
Lin says: "I don't need to explain myself to you.  Just do what I say."
Korra says: "Fine.  You got it, Chief Crankypants."
Aiwei says: "Avatar Korra. It is an honor to meet you.  My name is Aiwei."
Korra says: "Thanks for having us."
Aiwei says: "Is this everyone?"
Korra says: "Yup.  Just us. So, can I meet the new airbender?"
Aiwei says: "Of course,  right this way."
