Korra says: "How did things get so bad between you and Kuvira? I thought she was your protégé."
Suyin says: "She was more than that. She was like a daughter to me. I took her in when she was eight years old and nourished her talents. Kuvira was smart, a natural leader, and quickly rose through the ranks. I saw myself in her."
Korra says: "What happened?"
Suyin says: "Three years ago, after the fall of the Earth Queen, Raiko and Tenzin came to see me."
