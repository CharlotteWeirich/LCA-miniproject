Varrick says: "Bolin, do the thing."
Bolin says: "What thing?"
Varrick says: "The thing! I never had to tell Zhu Li what thing!"
Bolin says: "I'm not Zhu Li, okay? Pretend I don't know anything about anything that's happening here, also pretend I don't want to build a super weapon or get my hands blown off!"
Baatar Jr. says: "Walk me through what you're doing. I want to know every detail of your work."
Varrick says: "You know, when I started working with the vines,  the point was to find a clean, unlimited source of energy, not develop some spirity death ray."
Bolin says: "Clean energy! Sounds great! Who doesn't like that stuff? Let's do that instead!"
Baatar Jr. says: "Quiet! You're here to help, not talk.  And you of all people, should realize that once a discovery is made, it is our responsibility as scientists  to pursue it as far as we can.  Wherever it leads."
Varrick says: "How would you know? You couldn't discover a wolfbat if it was building a nest in your butt."
Baatar Jr. says: "You're pathetic.  Wolfbats don't build nests."
Varrick says: "Ooh. You got me there, Dr. Science. You'll never know how it feels to give birth to genius, only to have it kidnapped, and raised by fools!"
Baatar Jr. says: "Are you done with your rambling, or do the guards need to encourage you to continue your work?"
Varrick says: "Okay, okay,  The last time we ran the current through the vine  we couldn't control the power, so I'm trying something new to see if I can direct it."
