Zaheer says: "I'm going to create some cover. We've got to get out of here!"
Lin says: "How did they get in here?"
Suyin says: "I don't know, but we're not letting them escape!"
Asami says: "There's no way to cross that moat."
Suyin says: "We don't need to cross it. Lin and I can drop in from the dome on cables."
Lin says: "That's a great idea. Except we'll get blown up the second that third-eyed freak sees us."
Suyin says: "She's a combustionbender. If one of you can stun her, her powers will be knocked out temporarily."
Mako says: "Bolin can land a shot."
Bolin says: "I can?"
Suyin says: "You have to take her out right before we drop down."
Bolin says: "I do?"
