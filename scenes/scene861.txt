Korra says: "I'm really sorry ... about everything I said.  I was really frustrated with myself,  and I took it out on you."
Tenzin says: "I think I owe you an apology too. I was trying to teach you about patience, but I lost mine."
Korra says: "No hard feelings?"
Tenzin says: "Of course not. By the way, you were really good out there tonight.  You moved just like an airbender!"
Korra says: "Wait ...  You stayed and watched?"
Tenzin says: "I did. Pro-bending turned out to be the perfect teaching tool for you."
Korra says: "I'll see you tomorrow for airbending practice, bright and early!  And, by the way, I kinda permanently joined the Fire Ferrets and we're playing in the tournament in a couple of weeks!"
