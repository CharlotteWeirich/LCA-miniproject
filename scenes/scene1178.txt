Tenzin says: "Tattoos. How could she think? Focus. Breathe. Bumi ruins everything. Inhale. Focus."
Pema says: "Taking a little break from teaching?"
Tenzin says: "I've failed. Bumi quit, the rest of the airbenders want to go home. Can't they see that I'm trying to rebuild an entire culture?"
Pema says: "You know, just because these people can airbend, it doesn't automatically make them Air Nomads."
Tenzin says: "Tell me about it."
Pema says: "I remembered when I moved down my parents' house to become an Air Acolyte. That first night I was so scared and lonely and the bed was so hard."
Tenzin says: "It's actually better for your back.  Sorry."
Pema says: "The point is: I really wanted to be there, but it still took time for me to adjust to feel like I was a part of it all. The people are probably feeling the same way. You have to be patient."
Tenzin says: "Now I know how Korra feels when I'm talking to her.  Thank you, Pema."
