Bumi says: "If it weren't so cold, I'd go right back to sleep."
Tenzin says: "Then, this is the perfect time to learn meditation and proper breathing technique. Airbenders are able to warm themselves only with their breathing.  Everyone get into the lotus position. Ah, this is so much more refreshing than sleeping."
