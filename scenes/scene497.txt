Toph says: "There you are. You got my dinner yet?"
Korra says: "No ... this swamp ... it did crazy things to my mind. I had visions, of all the times my enemies hurt me."
Toph says: "Yeah, I figured something like that might happen."
Korra says: "What? You wanted me to see those visions? You are one twisted old lady, you know that?"
Toph says: "Look, I know you want to get better. And so does the swamp! It can sense you're out of balance. It will teach you what you need to learn, if you're open to listening."
Korra says: "Okay, swamp. I'm all ears."
Toph says: "You said you saw your past enemies. Now, why do you think that is?"
Korra says: "I don't know. Because they made me and a lot of other people suffer."
Toph says: "Sounds like you're carrying around your former enemies, the same way you're still carrying around that metal poison. You maybe consider you could learn something from them?"
Korra says: "Sounds like the swamp is messing with your mind too."
Toph says: "My mind is just fine, thank you. Listen,  what did Amon want? Equality for all. Unalaq? He brought back the spirits. And Zaheer believed in freedom."
Korra says: "I guess ..."
Toph says: "The problem was, those guys were totally out of balance and they took their ideologies too far."
Korra says: "Okay, fine. But that doesn't explain why they keep haunting me."
Toph says: "Because you need to face your fears. You can't expect to deal with future enemies if you're still fighting the old ones."
Korra says: "Maybe you're right, but how am I supposed to move on?"
Toph says: "Boy, you Avatars sure need a lot of hand-holding. Get up! We're going to the banyan-grove tree."
