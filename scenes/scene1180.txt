Jinora says: "How can you steal these bisons? They're endangered."
Ganbat says: "Well, that's why they're worth so much. The Earth Queen and her fancy friends pay big money for bison steaks and other rare meats. I even heard she ate her dad's pet bear."
Jinora says: "You're disgusting."
Kai says: "Hey, do that spirit beaming thing you did to find me. Go to the temple for help."
Jinora says: "I can't. I'm all cramped in here and I need quiet and time to focus. But, maybe I can send a message.  Spirits, I need your help.  Go find Bum-Ju, tell him we're in trouble."
