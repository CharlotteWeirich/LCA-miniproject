Korra says: "I thought you said Bolin was coming?"
Mako says: "He said he'd be here, but I can't worry about it. I have to make sure you have everything you need for a safe trip."
Korra says: "Thanks, Captain Expedition, but I'll be fine."
Unalaq says: "Tonraq, what do you want?"
Tonraq says: "I heard you're taking Korra to the South Pole.  I'm coming."
Unalaq says: "Absolutely not. You're a distraction to Korra and a hindrance to what needs to be done."
Tonraq says: "My daughter is not going without me! She needs someone to watch after her."
Korra says: "Dad, why do you always think you know what's best for me?"
Unalaq says: "Because he's misguided. The sad truth is, it's men like your father who have put the Spirit World out of balance. He's ignored my warnings in the past and hasn't learned since."
Korra says: "What happened in the past?"
Tonraq says: "It doesn't matter. What matters is the Everstorm."
Mako says: "The Everstorm?"
Tonraq says: "It's a massive blizzard that's battered the South Pole for decades.  I'm coming, unless you think you can stop me."
