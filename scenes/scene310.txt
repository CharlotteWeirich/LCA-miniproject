Kai says: "Hey, what's your boyfriend doing here?"
Opal says: "If he's here, he must be with Kuvira and my brother. This isn't going to be good."
Kai says: "Bolin!"
Bolin says: "Kai!  Wow, you are a lot heavier than you used to be. You're really growing up."
Kai says: "What's up with your new hair? You look like a stiff."
Bolin says: "Hey, Kuvira says it makes me look intelligent and professional."
Opal says: "Don't believe everything she says."
Bolin says: "Opal, I can't believe you're here too!  I missed you so much."
Opal says: "I missed you too."
Baatar Jr. says: "Look who it is. It's good to see you again, little sister."
Kuvira says: "What a wonderful surprise. A happy reunion for my favorite couple."
Baatar Jr. says: "How's Mom doing?"
Opal says: "Like you care. She still hasn't forgiven you."
Baatar Jr. says: "You know, for someone who claims to be so enlightened, Mom can really hold a grudge."
Opal says: "I guess when her son betrays her ..."
Kuvira says: "Please, Opal, we're not here to bicker with you about something that happened three years ago. We're here to help this town, just like you."
Opal says: "I've heard how you help towns. By conquering them."
Kuvira says: "I know the rumors about me can be pretty nasty, but I am giving everyone in this nation a better future. And with Bolin's help, and my fiancé's ideas, we're laying the ground work for the people to achieve their own greatness."
Opal says: "Your fiancé?"
Kuvira says: "You haven't heard?  Your brother and I are getting married."
Bolin says: "Isn't that great, sweetie?"
Kuvira says: "I know things got heated with your family when Baatar and I left Zaofu, but don't you think it's time to forgive and forget?"
