Korra says: "Man, I got a good feeling about tonight. I don't care if we are the underdogs. We can take those pompous Wolfbats."

Bolin says: "Introducing your new champs, the fantastic Fire Ferrets!"
Amon says: "Good morning, citizens of Republic City. This is Amon.  I hope you all enjoyed last night's pro-bending match, because it will be the last.  It's time for this city to stop worshiping bending athletes as if they were heroes. I am calling on the council to shut down the bending arena  and cancel the finals, or else there will be severe consequences."
Bolin says: "That guy's got some nerve."
Mako says: "You think the council will give in?"
Korra says: "I'm not waiting to find out. We need to get to City Hall."
