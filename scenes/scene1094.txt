Jinora says: "Ugh, it's not in here either! I have to find the portals. Korra is probably waiting for me there right now! I need to find a map that shows where the spirit portals are, could you help me? Thanks, this is it! The Tree of Time! That's where Avatar Wan imprisoned Vaatu! The elders believe that as long as the portals are closed during the Harmonic Convergence, Vaatu will remain imprisoned and the battle between good and evil will not be fought again. But, if both portals are open, spirit energy is amplified greatly. During the Harmonic Convergence, this energy will be great enough to allow Vaatu to break free from his bonds, and the material world will again risk being consumed by darkness. We have to warn Korra!"
Unalaq says: "Leaving so soon? When Wan Shi Tong told me he had a visitor, I had to see it with my own eyes. I can't believe Tenzin sent his daughter here instead of coming himself - what kind of a father is he?"
Jinora says: "Better than you. Wan Shi Tong, how can you be helping him?"
Wan Shi Tong says: "Unalaq has proven to be a true friend to the spirits - unlike the Avatar."
Jinora says: "Why would you wanna help Vaatu escape? He'll destroy everything!"
Unalaq says: "Don't believe everything you read. Why don't you come with me, so you can do some firsthand research?"
Jinora says: "Furry-Foot ...?"
