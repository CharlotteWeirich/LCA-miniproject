Tonraq says: "Did you speak to Zaheer?"
Korra says: "Yes. He told me to come to the top of Laghima's Peak at noon, alone. Once he has me, he'll release the airbenders over to you at the temple."
Suyin says: "I think I figured a way to play this so that the airbenders and Korra all come out in one piece."
Lin says: "How?"
Suyin says: "Zaheer doesn't know how many of us there are, so we have the numbers advantage. I say we split into two teams:  Mako, Bolin and Asami will take the airship up to the temple.  Meanwhile, my metalbenders, Tonraq, Lin, and I will get in position below Laghima's Peak."
