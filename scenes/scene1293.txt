Tarrlok says: "A few years later, my father taught us to bloodbend anytime, without the need of the full moon.  We practiced constantly, and I hated every minute of it.  I had no stomach for manipulating helpless animals. My brother, however, seemed to revel in this newfound power.  He was a prodigy, mastering my father's psychic bloodbending technique by the time he was fourteen."
