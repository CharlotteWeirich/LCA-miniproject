Bolin says: "Wow! Nice adjustment!  You're a natural at this."
Mako says: "Not bad."
Korra says: "What's it take to impress this guy?"
Mako says: "What? I said "not bad".  You know what, it's getting late.  I think I'm gonna turn in. You kids have fun.  Nice to meet you, Avatar Korra."
Korra says: "Yeah, been a real pleasure."
Mako says: "See ya upstairs, bro."
Korra says: "Upstairs?  You guys live here?"
Bolin says: "Yup. In the attic. It's nothin' fancy, but we have some great views!  So, back to bending. Why don't you throw that combo one more time?"
