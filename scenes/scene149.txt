Hiroshi says: "Asami, you came."
Asami says: "I came to return these."
Hiroshi says: "You never opened them."
Asami says: "Stop writing me. I never want to see or hear from you again."
Hiroshi says: "Please, just let me say one thing, then I'll never contact you again."
Hiroshi says: "I can't forgive myself for all the horrible things I've done. And I never expect you to forgive me. I tore our family apart, and destroyed our good name.  But in a life of regret, you're the one thing I look back on that makes me smile.  I just want you to know I'm so proud of you, Asami. You are the greatest thing I ever created."
