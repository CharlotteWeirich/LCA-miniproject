Tenzin's children says: "Gran Gran!"
Katara says: "Oh ... you've all gotten so big."
Jinora says: "We missed you, Aunt Kya."
Kya says: "Ohh, I missed you, too. Your father doesn't bring you to visit nearly enough. He's probably scared I'll beat him up  like when we were kids."
Tenzin says: "I'm not scared of you ...  anymore."
