Varrick says: "Oh ... she really is gone."
Baatar Jr. says: "Up and at 'em, Varrick! Time to go to work.  We have another lab set up for you.  Kuvira wants the spirit vine weapon operational as soon as possible."
Varrick says: "Zhu Li always greeted me in the morning with a  a hot cup of tea."
Baatar Jr. says: "You'll get your tea when you start working."
Varrick says: "Well, I'm really only productive for about fifteen minutes a day, usually in the afternoon around three-forty-five."
Baatar Jr. says: "You'll work now. I want you to show me how the device works."
Bolin says: "What's goin' on?"
Baatar Jr. says: "Go back to sleep. We only need Varrick. You'll need your energy when you get to the re-education camp."
Varrick says: "I can't be expected to work without an assistant! Without Zhu Li, I'm helpless!"
Baatar Jr. says: "One of the guards will be your assistant. I'll be supervising."
Varrick says: "Well, I guess he'll be fine. As long as he doesn't need his hands afterwards!"
Guard #1 says: "What's he talking about, sir?"
Varrick says: "The last time we worked with the spirit vines, it created an uncontrollable blast  that burned through a wall and could still be blowing up comets in space, as far as I know! I wouldn't want to assist me if I were you!"
Guard #1 says: "Maybe we should just let the kid help him out."
Baatar Jr. says: "Fine. Bolin can assist."
Bolin says: "Wait, what? I need my hands!  Uh, hold on! Can we have breakfast first?  While we still have hands?"
