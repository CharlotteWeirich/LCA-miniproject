Jinora says: "Are you really ready to fight her?"
Korra says: "Just stay back and let me handle this.  It's been a while,  but I got a lot of pent-up rage."
Opal says: "Don't mess around!  Kuvira is too good! Just go into the Avatar State and get it over with!"
Korra says: "No, I'm only going to use that as a last resort."
Jinora says: "Be careful."
Kuvira says: "Use whatever you want: all the elements; the Avatar State; anything you need.  I know you're a little rusty."
Korra says: "Enough talk!"
Kuvira says: "Looks like the Avatar's a little off her game!"
Opal says: "Don't let her get you frustrated! She wants you to make a mistake!"
