Tonraq says: "We tracked them deep into an ancient forest. Many believed this forest was the home to spirits, and the barbarians retreated there because they thought we wouldn't attack them on such hallow grounds. They thought wrong."
Tonraq says: "We captured the barbarians, but in the process, we destroyed the forest.  I didn't realize the consequences of what I had done.  By destroying the forest, I unknowingly let loose angry spirits."
Tonraq says: "They threatened to destroy everything, the entire city."
