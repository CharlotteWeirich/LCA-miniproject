Saikhan says: "It was an honor serving under Chief Beifong for so many years  and I wish her a speedy recovery. It is with great humility that I take her place as the new Chief of Police. Republic City is facing a threat like none the world has ever seen but there is one man who's been effective against Amon's revolution, Councilman Tarrlok.  That is why for all matters involving the Equalists, I will report directly to him.  The police department will lend any and all available resources to the councilman and his task force  until we quell this insurgency."
Korra says: "What is that weasel snake Tarrlok up to now?"
