Mako says: "After that, I dove into my work. Someone had been taking out supply ships heading to the Southern Water Tribe.  Asami's company was one of the victims, so she and I worked together to catch the perps.  The stakeout was the perfect way to get my mind off Korra. It was an intense night.  Asami and I discovered the triads had double-crossed us. We barely got away, but by then, Asami's warehouse had been cleared out."
