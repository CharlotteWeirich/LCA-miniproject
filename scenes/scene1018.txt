Tenzin says: "As soon as we reach the Southern Water Tribe, we'll blast through the blockade at the main portal.  Then we can rendezvous with Tonraq and his troops, crash through the defenses around the portal, and enter the Spirit World."
Kya says: "Woah! Since when does my little brother wanna crash or blast through anything?"
Tenzin says: "I'll do whatever it takes to save my daughter."
Bumi says: "We all want to save Jinora, but I think your plan might be a tad over-aggressive, seeing as there are only seven of us and one ship."
Tenzin says: "Really? And what do you suggest?"
Bumi says: "An attack like this calls for strategy. I remember when I was surrounded by pirates at the Hurricane Straits. We managed to capture them all, with just a feather, two eggs and a barrel of molasses."
Tenzin says: "I don't want to hear any of your crazy stories now! This is serious!"
