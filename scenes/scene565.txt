Tenzin says: "Thank you all for meeting us on such short notice."
Lin says: "Chief."
Saikhan says: "Lin."
Tarrlok says: "Have you news of Avatar Korra?"
Tenzin says: "We do.  You kidnapped her, Tarrlok!"
Tarrlok says: "I am shocked you would accuse me of such an evil act! I already explained: Equalists attacked us and took her!"
Tenzin says: "But there were no chi blockers here last night.  You planted the evidence, didn't you?"
Tarrlok says: "That is a ridiculous accusation!"
Council page says: "It's true! He took her! I was here when Avatar Korra arrived last night, but Councilman Tarrlok ordered me to leave. I was on my way out when I saw Tarrlok bring her down to the garage."
Tarrlok says: "Say goodbye to Republic City, Avatar Korra. You'll never see it again."
Tarrlok says: "That is nonsense!  Everyone knows you're nothing but a squeaky-voiced liar!"
Lin says: "Why did you wait until now to 'fess up?"
Council page says: "I was terrified to tell because ...  Because Tarrlok is a bloodbender!  He bloodbent Avatar Korra!"
Tenzin says: "Don't make this worse for yourself.  Tell us where you have Korra."
