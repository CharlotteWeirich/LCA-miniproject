Korra says: "So, why is Bolin running around with the Triple Threat Triad, anyway?"
Mako says: "Well, we ... we used to do some work for them back in the day."
Korra says: "What? Wha- Are you some kind of criminal?"
Mako says: "No! You don't know what you're talking about. I just ran numbers for them and stuff. We were orphans out on the street; I did what I had to do to survive and protect my little brother."
Korra says: "I'm sorry. It must have been really hard.  Can I ask what happened to your parents?"
Mako says: "They were mugged, by a firebender. He cut them down right in front of me. I was eight."
Korra says: "Mako ..."
Mako says: "Bolin's the only family I have left. If anything happened to him ..."
