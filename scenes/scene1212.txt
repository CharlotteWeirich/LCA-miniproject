Protester says: "Are you tired of living under the tyranny of benders? Then join the Equalists!  For too long, the bending elite of this city  have forced nonbenders to live as lower class citizens. Join Amon, and together we will tear down the bending establishment."
Korra says: "What are you talking about?  Bending is the coolest thing in the world."
Protester says: "Oh yeah? Let me guess: you're a bender."
Korra says: "Yeah, I am."
Protester says: "Then I bet you'd just love to knock me off this platform with some waterbending, huh?"
Korra says: "I'm seriously thinking about it."
Protester says: "This is what's wrong with this city! Benders like this girl only use their power to oppress us!"
Crowd says: "Yeah! Get out of here!"
Korra says: "What? I'm not oppressing anyone!  You're ... you're oppressing yourselves!"
Protester says: "That didn't even make sense."
