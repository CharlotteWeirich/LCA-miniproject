Hiroshi says: "You came back."
Asami says: "When I first came here, it was because I wanted to tell you face to face that I never wanted to see or hear from you again. I wanted my words to hurt you so that you would know how you hurt me."
Hiroshi says: "I'm sorry."
Asami says: "But when I saw you, it wasn't anger I felt. It was sadness. You tainted our past and destroyed our future together."
Hiroshi says: "I want to make amends."
Asami says: "I'm not sure I'll ever be able to forgive you. But that doesn't mean I shouldn't try."
Asami says: "I thought we could play some Pai Sho. Like we used to."
Hiroshi says: "Nothing ... would make me happier."
