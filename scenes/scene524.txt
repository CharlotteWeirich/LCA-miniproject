Lin says: "Who is it?"
Korra says: "Hey, it's me. I brought someone who wants to talk to you."
Lin says: "You want to talk? Then talk."
Opal says: "I'm sorry being here has been so hard for you. When you showed up, I was so excited to get to know you. I heard so many great things about you from mom and Grandma Toph. So, I guess I was kind of sad you didn't want to know me.  Believe me, I know my family can be a little crazy and overwhelming some times. But I would love it so much if you would be a part of it."
Lin says: "Get out."
Opal says: "Sorry, did I say something wrong?"
Lin says: "Get out!"
Korra says: "What's your problem? Don't get mad at Opal. I asked her to talk to you because I thought it would help you snap out of whatever funk you're in. But I guess I was wrong."
Lin says: "Why don't you focus on fixing the world, and stop trying to fix my family?"
Korra says: "Su's right. You're never going to change. You're always gonna be a bitter, lonely woman."
