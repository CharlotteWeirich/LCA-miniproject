Korra says: "Is it okay if I come in?"
Senna says: "Of course. We heard what happened. Are you okay?"
Korra says: "I'm so glad you weren't there. I don't know what I would've done."
Tonraq says: "I had no idea how far Varrick was willing to go. My brother and I have our differences, but I would never attack him."
Korra says: "I'm sorry for thinking you had anything to do with the rebels. And for all the pain I've caused you and Mom."
Tonraq says: "I'm the one who should apologize. After I saw the Southern Lights return, I was so proud of you. I never should've held you back."
Senna says: "When your father and I found each other, all we wanted was to live a simple life and raise a family. But, then we discovered you were the Avatar, and simple was over. We knew one day the world would need you, and you wouldn't need us anymore."
Korra says: "Mom, Dad,  of course I still need you."
Tonraq says: "We weren't expecting you."
Unalaq says: "Tonraq, Senna, you are under arrest and will stand trial."
Tonraq says: "Trial? For what?"
Unalaq says: "For conspiring to assassinate me."
