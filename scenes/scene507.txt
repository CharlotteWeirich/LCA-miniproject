Daw says: "It's so nice to meet you. How exciting. New friends."
Zaheer says: "Excuse me, hello?  My name is Yorru.  I heard this is the place to come for if you're a new airbender."

Zaheer says: "Well, a couple of weeks ago, I woke up and suddenly I can do this."
Ikki says: "Mom!  Aunt Kya!  We got another one!"
