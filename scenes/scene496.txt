Ikki says: "It seems pretty lonely out here. Where's everybody else?"
Outpost soldier #1 says: "I ... don't want to talk about it."
Outpost soldier #2 says: "He's just upset because Kuvira's taking all the troops to Zaofu and we had to stay here."
Outpost soldier #1 says: "Well it's the last city left and then the whole empire will be united! And you know there's gonna be a huge party afterwards."
Ikki says: "It's tough to be left out, huh? I know exactly what you're going through."
Outpost soldier #1 says: "You do?"
Ikki says: "Yeah. My brother and sister are always leaving me out of fun stuff. I mean, we're supposed to be looking for the Avatar together, but they won't even let me help."
Outpost soldier #2 says: "Well, that's not fair. Maybe we can help you out!  So, where have you looked for her?"
Ikki says: "We've been traveling down the west coast, and the only lead we have is some guy who said he saw her six months ago."
Outpost soldier #1 says: "Well, we have troops ... pretty much everywhere. If anyone saw her, they would have reported it."
Ikki says: "What about this place?"
Outpost soldier #1 says: "Well, that's the swamp. No one goes there."
Outpost soldier #2 says: "Don't get discouraged, Ikki. You're a valuable member of the team, and you have a big heart! I know you're going to find her. Now let's get you out of those ropes."
Meelo says: "You're welcome, Ikki."
Ikki says: "Why did you do that?"
Jinora says: "We're saving you. Let's go."
Ikki says: "I had everything under control. I just found our food, and I have an idea where Korra is."
Jinora says: "You do? Then lets get going!"
Ikki says: "Hold on.  Sorry my brother and sister knocked you out. Nice chatting with you!"
Outpost soldier #2 says: "Ugh ... Macaroon ..."
