Mako says: "So I walk up and say: "Looks like you had some car trouble. Good thing the police are here.""
Korra says: "Did you write that beforehand?"
Mako says: "Yeah! I had a few others.  Let's see, uh ... "Looks like you guys should put more 'try' in triad", huh? Or, "when you get to jail,  tell 'em Mako sent ya"."
Korra says: "Ooh, I like that one."
Mako says: "Okay, I'll use that next time. Beifong says if I keep it up, I could make detective soon."
Korra says: "That sounds so fun. All I do is train all day. It's like Tenzin's totally forgotten how I beat Amon."
Mako says: "Tenzin's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be."
Korra says: "Of course you'd take his side!"
Mako says: "I'm not taking his side, I'm just ..."
Korra says: "I'm gonna take a walk."
Mako says: "Why is it so much easier to bust triads than it is to get through one conversation with my girlfriend?"
