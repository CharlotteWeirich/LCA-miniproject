Mako says: "The whole city is falling to pieces."
Bolin says: "Mako, our family's down there."
Mako says: "Move over, we're getting them out."
Bolin says: "Oh, you think just because you dated Asami, you know how to fly this better than me?"
Mako says: "Yeah."
Chow says: "Bolin? What are you doing here?"
Bolin says: "I came to get you guys out. This whole block is about to go up in flames. Come on, Mako and I have an airship on the roof."
Tu says: "We can't. Grandma won't go."
Yin says: "This place is my whole world. I will not leave!  Oh, but I'm so glad my little Bolin has come back to visit. Sit down, would you like some tea?"
Bolin says: "Grandma, we don't have time for tea."
Chow says: "Mom, please!"
Yin says: "No! I can't abandon the place where I raised my family. It's my home."
Bolin says: "Grandma, there's one thing Mako and I've learned from all our years on the street. It doesn't matter where you go.  If you have your family with you, you'll always be at home."
Yin says: "I'm not going."
Bolin says: "Fine!  You leave me no choice.  We're rolling out!"
Yin says: "Wait.  Okay, let's go!"
