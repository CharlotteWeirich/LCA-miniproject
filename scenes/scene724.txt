Korra says: "Aang?"
Tenzin says: "Korra!  Korra, are you all right? What happened? Was Amon here?"
Korra says: "Yeah, he ambushed me."
Tenzin says: "Did he ... did he take your bending away?"
Korra says: "No, I'm okay."
Tenzin says: "Ah, thank goodness."
Korra says: "I was so terrified, I felt so helpless."
Tenzin says: "It's all right, the nightmare is over."
Korra says: "You ... you were right ... I've been scared this whole time.  I've never felt like this before and ... and Tenzin, I don't know what to do!"
Tenzin says: "Admitting your fears is the first and most difficult step in overcoming them."
