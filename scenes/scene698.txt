Korra says: "I can't believe the President is doing nothing! H-He doesn't even care!"
Mako says: "I'm sure he cares, but he can't just tell his people to go fight a battle at the South Pole that has nothing to do with them."
Korra says: "How could you take his side?"
Mako says: "What's with you and sides? Why do you always think I'm working against you?"
Korra says: "Well, you're not helping me! I'm trying to get troops to the South. What are you doing?"
Mako says: "I'm doing my job."
Korra says: "Well, excuse me, officer. Don't let me stand in the way of you writing tickets. I'm just trying to save the world."
Mako says: "Well, you wouldn't have to if you didn't keep messing it up!"
Korra says: "I can't talk to you when you're like this."
Mako says: "You're the one who's like this!"
