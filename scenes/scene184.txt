Asami says: "We should go inside."
Ikki says: "I-I can help."

Raiko says: "She's not looking good."
Tonraq says: "Neither would you if you'd gone through what she had."

Raiko says: "Exactly. With the world getting more and more dangerous, we need the Avatar now more than ever. Who will protect us while she's in a wheelchair?"
