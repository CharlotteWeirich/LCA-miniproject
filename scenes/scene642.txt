Korra says: "We've been going about his all wrong.  You're right. I'm not gonna physically hurt you if you don't talk. But there is something I could do that will be even more painful.  I will take away the one thing you care for the most ... Kuvira."
Baatar Jr. says: "What do you mean?"
Korra says: "Kuvira might win. She might chase us out of the city. But you won't be around to enjoy the victory. Because wherever I run, I'll take you. I am going to make it my life's mission to never let you see the one you love again.  Is taking the city worth losing Kuvira forever?"
Baatar Jr. says: "No! You can't!"
Korra says: "I will ... unless you convince Kuvira to back off. You two will still have the Earth Empire. Just leave the United Republic alone."
