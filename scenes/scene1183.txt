Bumi says: "Bison rustlers. They've got Kai and Jinora locked in crates. Looks like they're getting ready to leave, we'll have to move fast."
Daw says: "I don't know if I'm ready to get in a fight with some bison rustlers. I can tell without that telescope that they're mean-looking."
Bumi says: "Listen, this is what we've been training for."
Daw says: "We haven't been training that long."
Bumi says: "That's not important now. Remembered how we persevered together on that obstacle course?"
Otaku says: "You actually quit."
Bumi says: "Well, I'm not quitting now. I know we've had a tough time, me more than anyone, but we're airbenders, and there aren't many of us so we've got to stick together. They've got two of our own in cages out there, and we're not leaving until we bring them home."
Meelo says: "Leave no airbender behind!"
Kai says: "In. Down. And twist."
Jinora says: "Free the bison first."
Bison rustler #2 says: "Hey! What are you doing out?"
