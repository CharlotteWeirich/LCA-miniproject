Varrick says: "Never thought I'd be allowed back in the Republic City Four Elements.  Raiko must have turned purple when Kuvira made him pardon me of my alleged crimes."
Zhu Li says: "You're an upstanding citizen again, sir."
Varrick says: "Upstanding is right!  And don't forget to fill the extra bag with as many of those little soaps as you can grab.  Love the lavender scent."
Mako says: "Bolin!  Look at you! My little brother got all ... important."
Bolin says: "I know, right? I see myself in the mirror sometimes and I think I'm in trouble before I realize: it's only me."
Mako says: "So, what's it like working for Kuvira?  From what I've heard, she's pretty harsh."
Bolin says: "No! Iâ€”I mean, she can be tough, sure, but we're turning around the Earth Kingdom like you wouldn't believe! You remember how bad Grandma's neighborhood in Ba Sing Se was? All that's completely changed, I mean, we are really ... helping people. But what have you been up to? Fighting crime?  Busting triads? Chasing the ladies,  Mako-style?"
Mako says: "Well, I've been working for Wu.  And, uhhh ...  Yeah."
Bolin says: "So, have you seen Korra yet?"
Mako says: "No. She was supposed to come in with Tonraq, but he said she left the South Pole months ago. No one knows where she is."
