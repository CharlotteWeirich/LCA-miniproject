Suyin says: "You know, before I built this city, there was nothing here. I wanted to make my mark on the world."
Korra says: "It's amazing. Thank you for being so welcoming. And I'm sorry for how Lin's been acting. Can I ask what happened with you two?"
Suyin says: "It's complicated. We didn't have a normal childhood. Neither of us knew our fathers and Toph was always busy being Chief of Police. Because mom grew up in such a strict household, she gave us all the freedom in the world, hoping we'd figure out our own paths."
Korra says: "That sounds like a good thing."
Suyin says: "And in a way it was. But we both ended up fighting for mom's attention. Lin followed in her footsteps and became a cop. I was ... more of a rebel. Mom wasn't too happy with how either of us turned out. When I was sixteen, I left home to explore the world.  I sailed the seas on a pirate ship, joined a traveling circus for a while, and lived in a sandbender commune in a desert. It took me a while, but, I finally realized what I was looking for was a family. So I bought this plot of land, found a brilliant architect who later became my husband, and created a place I could truly call home."
Korra says: "It sounds like you've created the perfect life here."
Suyin says: "Almost. I've always wanted Lin to be a part of it, but I gave up hope long ago of her ever coming around."
