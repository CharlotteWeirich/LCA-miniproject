Suyin says: "Don't say that! Can't you see she's brainwashed you!"
Kuvira says: "Ha! I didn't brainwash him! I set him free! And now he's accomplished more with me than he ever could with you."
Bolin says: "Okay, guys, obviously, there's a lot of personal, painful history here, so what do you say we just all forget about that stuff, huh? I mean, that's the past!  Right Wing? Right Wei? You guys know what I'm talkin' 'bout, right? High five!  All right. No, that's cool.  You know what I think we need to do? Focus on the future! And the future is bright, let me tell you!  I've seen it! Yeah!  Saw it last month! We went to this town that had nothing. Most of the people there had never seen a Satomobile before. Now, they have two Satomobiles, running water, and a magnet train that goes right through their town! I mean, how awesome is that?"
Opal says: "They might have been happy when you first arrived, but I've seen what happens after you leave. Citizens are forced to work as slave labor, dissenters are sent off to who-knows-where!"
Bolin says: "You're wrong, Opal! Now, I don't know what you think you've seen, but I am giving you the one-hundred-percent Bolin guarantee that we're making the Earth Empire a better place to live!"
Suyin says: "I can't believe you brought Bolin here to try and sway us. Leave! Zaofu will never accept you as their leader!"
Kuvira says: "Then you leave me no choice. You have twenty-four hours to agree to join the Empire, or we take the city by force."
