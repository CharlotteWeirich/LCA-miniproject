Bumi says: "Can we go back to bed now?"
Tenzin says: "Now that we're refreshed and loose from our hike and meditation, it's time for a balancing exercise.  The key is to maintain your heaven and earth connection.  Now you try.  Back up your posts! It's not hard if you concentrate.  Get back up!  What's the matter, you can't handle it, soldier?"
Jinora says: "Don't you think you're a little hard on them."
Tenzin says: "Don't worry, they can take it. You'll see.  Ignore the lemurs digging in your ears. Concentrate on your breathing and, you won't even know they're there!  When the head is shaved, an airbender is able to feel the wind around him. It is both humbling and freeing."
Kai says: "Hey, you want to go sneak away and check on the baby bisons?"
Jinora says: "Shhh. You should be paying attention."
