Korra says: "I mean, you heard what Unalaq said.  The South is spiritually unbalanced and it's the Avatar's job to fix it, but my dad won't even let me think about Unalaq teaching me. Well?"
Mako says: "Well what?"
Korra says: "What do you think I should do?"
Mako says: "I guess you should do what you think is right. I support whatever decision you make."
Korra says: "Oh thanks. That's a big help."
Mako says: "I thought you wanted me to be supportive? Now you want me to tell you what I think? Make up your mind!"
Korra says: "Just forget it."
