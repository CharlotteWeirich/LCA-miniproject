Tonraq says: "Korra, you have every right to be mad at me. But I don't want you to make the same mistake I made. I should never have gone into that forest, and we shouldn't be going to the South Pole now. Spirits and the physical world should remain separate."
Korra says: "Dad, it's my job to be the bridge between the spirits and the physical world, and I finally have a chance to live up to my potential."
Tonraq says: "You don't even know if what Unalaq says is true."
Unalaq says: "You want proof? Look to the sky. Where I'm from, the spirits are at peace and they light up the dark."
Korra says: "The Northern Lights."
Unalaq says: "Yes. There used to be lights at the South as well, but during the Hundred Year War, the South was thrown out of balance and the lights disappeared. When the War ended, the North helped to rebuild you physically, as a nation, but we have not rebuilt you spiritually. Now the spirits no longer dance in your skies. Instead, they rampage in the Everstorm."
Mako says: "I think we're here."
