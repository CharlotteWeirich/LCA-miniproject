Varrick says: "Yes! Dead in their tracks.  Oh, rats. She's still coming. Zhu Li, do the thing!"
Zhu Li says: "I'm afraid there are no more things to do."
Kuvira says: "What was that?"
Soldier says: "An electromagnetic pulse. It shut down the mecha suits, but our power source is fine."
Kuvira says: "Locate the source of the pulse. That must be where Varrick is. Third and fourth mech platoons, move in and continue the sweep. Capture anyone left in the city."
