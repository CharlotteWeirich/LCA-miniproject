Korra says: "Woohoo! Man overboard!"
Referee says: "Fire Ferret waterbender, penalty! Move back one zone!"
Korra says: "What? Why?"
Mako says: "You're only allowed to knock players off the back of the ring! Not over the sides!"
Korra says: "Oh. Whoops."
Shiro Shinobi says: "And we're back in action after that hiccup, but I'm not so sure this replacement player knows what she's doing."
Referee says: "Foul! Over the line! Move back to zone three!"
Korra says: "Urgh!  I'll show you over the line!"
Shiro Shinobi says: "The Platypus Bears take round one!  The Platypus Bears know a green player when they see one, and they are focusing the brunt of their bending on this poor girl!"
Shiro Shinobi says: "Wait a minute! Did that waterbender just earthbend?"
Referee says: "Foul! I ... think."
Shiro Shinobi says: "Did I see that right?  Hold on, folks, we're just waiting for the referee's official call, but ...  I-I think this replacement player could be ... no, there's no way!"
Tenzin says: "Pardon me, everyone, have you seen Korra this evening? She's not in her room."
Shiro Shinobi says: "You've gotta be kidding me!  She's the Avatar, folks!  Playing in a pro-bending match!  Can you believe that?"
Tenzin says: "I'll get her myself!"
