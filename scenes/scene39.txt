Tenzin says: "No one's fighting! We're going to have a wonderful time!  Now that the president is in office and I'm not needed on the council, I can finally relax with my family and give Korra the attention she needs."
Korra says: "Great, more attention."
Bumi says: "Hah! Relax ... I'd pay money to see that. Maybe I'll tag along just to see "Vacation Tenzin"."
Tenzin says: "You're not invited."
Korra says: "Before we go on your dad's study trip, we're gonna have some real fun in my home town at the Glacier Spirits Festival. They've got rides, games, and all kinds of fried food on sticks."
Tenzin's children says: "Yay!"
Bumi says: "Yep. There's Vacation Tenzin. And you can't stop me from going to the festival, Mom already invited me."
