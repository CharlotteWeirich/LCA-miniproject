Tarrlok says: "There is a madman running around our beloved city, threatening to tear it apart. We need to create a task force whose sole mission is to find Amon and bring him to justice."
Tenzin says: "Absolutely not. A move that aggressive would only further divide benders and nonbenders."
Fire Nation councilwoman says: "Tarrlok, I'm inclined to agree with your proposal, but who would even  head up such a task force?"
Tarrlok says: "It would be my honor and privilege to accept such a duty."
Tenzin says: "This is just another one of your ploys to gain more power, isn't it?"
Tarrlok says: "All I'm trying to do is help. Think back, forty-two years ago, Republic City was threatened by another dangerous man. Yakone.  Your father wasn't afraid to deal with him head-on."
Tenzin says: "This.. is a completely different situation ...  and how dare you compare yourself to Avatar Aang!"
Tarrlok says: "Amon is not going to stop with the bending triads.  Eventually, he will come for all us benders. Our friends, our families. Vote for this task force and I will stop Amon before it's too late. All in favor?"
