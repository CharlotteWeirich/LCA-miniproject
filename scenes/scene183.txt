Asami says: "There you go. All fixed up for a formal Avatar appearance.  Take a look."
Korra says: "It's great. Thanks."
Asami says: "You know, nobody expects you to bounce back right away. It's only been two weeks. You need time to heal.  I want you to know that I'm here for you. If you ever want to talk, or, anything. But let's just try to enjoy this today; for Jinora."
Korra says: "You're right.  Okay, let's go."
