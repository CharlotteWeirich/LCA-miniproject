Bailiff says: "Councilman Sokka will now deliver the verdict."
Sokka says: "In my years, I have encountered people born with rare and unique bending abilities. Why, I once bested a man with my trusty boomerang who was able to firebend with his mind.  Why, even metalbending was considered impossible for all of history until our esteemed Chief of Police,  Toph Beifong, singlehandedly developed the skill. The overwhelming amount of testimony and evidence has convinced this council that Yakone is one of these unique benders and he exploited his ability to commit these heinous crimes. We find Yakone guilty of all charges and sentence him to life in prison."
