Asami says: "Pema, are you all right?"
Pema says: "The baby is ... just kicking, really hard, is all. I'm fine."
Asami says: "Should I get Tenzin?"
Pema says: "No reason to worry him, it's nothing."
Mako says: "Can I get some hot water? Korra needs more tea."
Asami says: "You're a firebender. Boil it yourself."
Pema says: "I'm- gonna step out in case you two want to talk."
Mako says: "Is there something we need to talk about?"
Asami says: "I've noticed how you treat Korra. How you acted when she was missing.  You have feelings for her, don't you?"
Mako says: "What? No! She was taken by a crazy bloodbender! How did you expect me to act?"
Asami says: "I like Korra.  But you've been keeping the truth from me this whole time."
Mako says: "The truth? About what?"
Asami says: "You're really going to make me say it?"
Mako says: "Yes! Because I don't know what you're talking about!"
Asami says: "The kiss, Mako.  I know."
Mako says: "I- Well I-  Bolin told you, didn't he?!"
Asami says: "Don't blame your brother for what you did. Do you have feelings for Korra or not?"
Mako says: "Look, things are crazy right now. Can we deal with our relationship problems later?"
Asami says: "Well there might not be any relationship to worry about later."
Mako says: "Asami!"
