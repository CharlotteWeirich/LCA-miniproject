Korra says: "Mako ... my bending."
Mako says: "Everything will be all right! We just need to get out of here."
Amon says: "I'm impressed. No one has ever gotten the better of me like that.  It is almost a shame to take the bending of someone so talented. Almost."
Korra says: "No!"
Amon says: "Impossible!"
Korra says: "I - I can airbend?  I can airbend!"
