Amon says: "Thank you all for joining me on this historic occasion!  When I was a boy, a firebender struck down my entire family and left me scarred. That tragic event began my quest to equalize the world."
Korra says: "That's a lie, Amon!  Or should I call you Noatak?"
Lieutenant says: "You want her taken out?"
Amon says: "No.  Everyone calm down, we have nothing to fear from the Avatar. Let's hear what she has to say."
Korra says: "Amon has been lying to you. The spirits didn't give him the power to take people's bending away. He uses bloodbending to do it.  Amon is a waterbender!"
Lieutenant says: "What is this nonsense?"
Amon says: "You're desperate, Avatar. Making up stories about me is a pathetic last resort."
Korra says: "Your family wasn't killed by a firebender.  His father was Yakone,  and his brother ... is Councilman Tarrlok."
Amon says: "Hmph, an amusing tale, but I will show you the truth.  This is what a firebender did to me."
Korra says: "What?"
Equalist supporter says: "The Avatar is lying!"
Korra says: "I'm telling you!  He's a waterbender.  They don't believe me. It didn't work!"
Mako says: "We said what we had to. Let's get out of here."
Amon says: "I wouldn't leave yet, Avatar. You'll miss the main event."
Korra says: "No ... they got away.  We saw them get away!"
