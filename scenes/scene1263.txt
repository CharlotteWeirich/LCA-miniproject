Korra says: "Mako, I've missed you so much."
Bolin says: "Oh yeah, did I forget to tell you? Korra's back."
Mako says: "Korra ... hey, I missed you, too. So you're not still mad at me?"
Korra says: "Why would I be mad?"
Mako says: "We had that fight before you left, remember?"
Korra says: "No, not really. I got attacked by a dark spirit and I lost my memory for a little while. Maybe it hasn't all come back yet. Was it a bad fight?"
Mako says: "Uh ...  No. No, it wasn't that bad."
Tenzin says: "Korra, we don't have much time. We need to figure out how to deal with Unalaq."
Bolin says: "I think I know just the man to talk to."
