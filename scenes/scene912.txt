Baatar Jr. says: "Mother."
Suyin says: "Hello, Baatar Jr."
Baatar Jr. says: "It's just "Baatar" now. So, now that you've seen all the good we've done since we left Zaofu, you must be sorry that you didn't come and help us."
Suyin says: "I don't know if I'd call marching all over the Earth Kingdom, forcing people to bow to Kuvira, "doing good"."
Baatar Jr. says: "You're going to have to get over your grudge with her. I'm sure you've heard that we're engaged. She's going to be an official member of our family."
Suyin says: "I'm just glad she'll be stepping down after tomorrow."
Baatar Jr. says: "You prefer to be ruled by  that royal idiot?"
Wu says: "I hope I'm not out of order saying this: You're pretty easy on the eyes for a military type.  I'll put in a good word for you with the hotel staff, maybe get you a little upgrade. I've been living here for years, they love me."
Kuvira says: "I won't be needing your help. We've reserved the presidential suite."
Wu says: "Well, I think someone is pulling your chain, gumdrop! See, I'm in the presidential suite."
Kuvira says: "Not anymore. I had you moved out."
Wu says: "Wait, what?  Cam, where's all my stuff?"
Cam says: "We've moved you into a very nice junior suite on the seventh floor."
Wu says: "Junior suite?"
Kuvira says: "Something you should know about me: I always get what I want."
