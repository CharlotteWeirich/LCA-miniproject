Tenzin says: "If anything goes wrong, come back immediately."
Jinora says: "I will."
Korra says: "What happened? What did you see?"
Jinora says: "The airbenders aren't there! It's completely deserted."
Tenzin says: "They're not down there?!"
Korra says: "Jinora, you've read all about Ba Sing Se. Can you think of any other places the airbenders might be?"
Jinora says: "I guess they could be in the catacombs beneath the Upper Ring, or the ancient sewers beneath the Lower Ring, or the maze of tunnels that connect the rings together, or they could beâ€”"
Tenzin says: "There are just too many places. There has to be another way to locate them."
Korra says: "Maybe there is.  How did you find me during Harmonic Convergence?"
Jinora says: "I don't know. I just kind of focused on your energy. I think our spiritual connection led me to you."
Korra says: "Maybe you can find Kai the same way. I know you two have a connection."
Tenzin says: "What do you mean "a connection"?"
Jinora says: "I don't know. Let me try."
