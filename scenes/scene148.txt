Zhu Li says: "Sir!"
Varrick says: "You're too heavy! You know, you could stand to lose a few Zhu Lis!"
Zhu Li says: "I think you're just weak, sir! Pull harder!"
Zhu Li says: "Varrick ... you saved me."
Varrick says: "Of course I saved you."
Varrick says: "I can't clean this place up by myself!  Grab a broom!"
Kuvira says: "What happened? Were we attacked?"
Varrick says: "No! We were spirit-vined! But don't worry! I'm putting the kibosh on this project."
Kuvira says: "No, you're not. Do you realize what we could do with this kind of power?"
Varrick says: "Yes! I do! And that's why we gotta put an end to it! What if it fell into the wrong hands?"
Baatar Jr. says: "Since when does that matter to you?"
Varrick says: "I know, it's not like me, right? Usually I look at a project like this and think, "Wow! I could make a ton of money off this!" But recently, I've been having these strange feelings ... inside.  It's like I'm ... concerned with others. And there's this nagging voice in my head constantly telling me what's right from wrong!"
Zhu Li says: "I believe that voice is your conscience, sir."
Kuvira says: "Well, I'm the other voice in your head, and I'm telling you you will continue with this project."
Varrick says: "Sorry, no. I just really gotta stand my ground on this one-- Whoa!"
Kuvira says: "And now there's a voice in my head telling me to drop you on the tracks.  Should I listen?"
Varrick says: "No! No! Head voices are liars, what do head voices know? I'll work on the project! Please don't drop me!"
