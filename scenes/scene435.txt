Mako says: "Bolin, have you seen Varrick around? Bolin!  Nuktuk."
Bolin says: "Yes? Oh, hello, Mako. Didn't notice you there."
Mako says: "Where's Varrick? I need to ask him something."
Bolin says: "Hmm. Can't say that I've seen him. But I've been kinda busy, you know, rehearsing for my big scene. There's gonna be some crazy  "pyrotechnics". That's mover speak for explosions."
Assistant director says: "We need Nuktuk on set. Running explosion scene."
Bolin says: "Or sometimes we just call them explosions. Anyway, wish I could stand around here and chitchat, but you know, I gotta go shoot my big scene."
