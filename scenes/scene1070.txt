Mako says: "Please, let us out."
Desna says: "His grovelling is pathetic."
Eska says: "But I do enjoy the sweet scent of desperation."
Mako says: "Come on, your dad has become an evil monster. He's gonna bring on eternal darkness. Why would you protect someone who doesn't care about you at all?"
Desna says: "Father was going to let me expire when we tried to open the northern portal. Perhaps we should rethink our position."
Mako says: "Yes!"
Eska says: "No. Don't listen to him. His words are poisoning your mind.  What's with this outburst of emotion?"
Bolin says: "I'm sorry, I can't help it. It's just so sad that I'll never be with you again."
Eska says: "What? Explain yourself further."
Bolin says: "Eska, I've always loved you. And I always wanted to be with you. But now that the world is ending,  I'm never gonna get that chance."
Eska says: "We could have been together, but you left me at the altar."
Bolin says: "No, I was scared. I was scared of my true feelings for you. Gah, I should have never left you. I'm sorry. And I'm sorry that we'll never have the chance to rekindle the dying ember that was our love into a big fire of love flames."
Eska says: "You'll never defeat my father. But, should you survive, perhaps we could spend eternal darkness together."
Mako says: "Wow! That was the best acting I've ever seen. You completely fooled her."
Bolin says: "Yeah right, huh. That was acting."
Desna says: "They will certainly perish."
