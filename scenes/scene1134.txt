Tenzin says: "The Avatar Spirit has returned."
Korra says: "It's over."
Mako says: "I don't even know what to say."
Tenzin says: "You were amazing."
Bolin says: "And the way you turned all gigantic like that, wow! I just wished Varrick was here to film it! It would be the greatest mover ever. After the Nuktuk chronicles of course."
Korra says: "I'm sorry about your father. But he was already fused with Vaatu. I couldn't save him."
Eska says: "It seems cousin Korra is under the impression we're saddened by our father's demise."
Desna says: "But I will not miss him at all. In the end, he became a deplorable man."
Eska says: "Agreed. But how will we explain this to mother?"
Bolin says: "So, I was thinking. I'm not really a fan of a long-distance relationship thing,  so how about you move to Republic City with me."
Eska says: "I do not think it will be possible."
Bolin says: "Okay. Desna can come too."
Eska says: "I will not be joining you, Bolin. Desna and I must return home."
Bolin says: "But you said-"
Eska says: "Eternal darkness was upon us. I became caught up in the moment."
Bolin says: "Yeah. I guess I did too."
Eska says: "But, you will always hold the special place in the organ that pumps my blood. I will remember you fondly.  My turtle duck."
