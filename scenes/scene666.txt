Varrick says: "I hear you've got some ideas. You wanna tell me about them?"
Mako says: "Go ahead. Torture me all you want. I'm not gonna talk."
Varrick says: "Torture? The only thing I want to torture is this pesky foot fungus.  Ah! Eee! Ooh! The burning means it's working.  I heard you've been investigating the recent attacks on my ships, and I think you know that I know that you know, you know?"
Mako says: "Know what?"
Varrick says: "That the world is a dangerous place, and that's exactly why I want to offer you a job on my security force."
Mako says: "I have a job."
Varrick says: "We need you. Me, Asami, Bolin. We're all in the same team here. We want you to join us. You wouldn't want anything to happen to Asami, would you? I mean, I heard you and her were kind of, uh, an item again. Or what about your brother?"
Mako says: "What are you saying?"
Varrick says: "I'm saying I want your help to protect them. Without you, who knows what could happen."
Mako says: "Thanks for your concern, but the answer is no."
