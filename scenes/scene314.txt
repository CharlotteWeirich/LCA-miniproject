Farmer says: "Sorry we couldn't give you more. That's all we could spare."
Opal says: "Every little bit helps. Because of you and the other farmers around here, we have more than enough food to feed the town until we can get some reinforcements."
Kai says: "Thanks!"
Kai says: "So ... you and Bolin doing okay?"
Opal says: "I don't know. It's really tough having a long distance relationship. And I can't stand that he's working with Kuvira."
Kai says: "I can tell. But it does seem like he found his calling, doesn't it? He loves helping people."
Opal says: "Maybe. It's just ... he's changed a lot since he's been around her."
Kai says: "He's growing up."
Opal says: "I just hope we're not growing apart.  Speaking of long-distance relationships, how are you and Jinora doing?"
Kai says: "Actually, we're doing fine.  You hear that?"
Kai says: "It's more bandits!"
Kai says: "We're hooked!"
Kai says: "No!"
