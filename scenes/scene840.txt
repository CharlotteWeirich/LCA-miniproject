Mako says: "You did more harm than good out there. You almost cost us the match!"
Hasook says: "We won, didn't we?"
Mako says: "Barely!"
Hasook says: "Get off my case, pal!  Ugh!"
Mako says: "Useless."
Korra says: "You guys were incredible out there!  Especially you, Mr. Hat Trick!"
Mako says: "Oh, you're still here?"
Korra says: "Oh, you're still a jerk?"
Bolin says: "Ooh!"
Korra says: "Anyway,  I've been immersed in bending my entire life, but I never learned how to move like that! It's like there's a whole new style here!  Think you could show me a few tricks?"
Bolin says: "Ab-so-lutely!"
Mako says: "Right now? Come on, Bolin."
Bolin says: "Just ignore him.  Yeah, I could show you the basics.  I'm just not sure how my earthbending would translate to your waterbending,  but we'll figure it out."
Korra says: "Won't be a problem.  I'm actually an earthbender."
Bolin says: "I'm sorry, no, no! I didn't mean to assume. 'Cause I, you know, I was just figuring ... with your Water Tribe getup ... that you are ... a Water Tribe ... gal."
Korra says: "Nope, you're right. I'm a waterbender. And a firebender."
Bolin says: "Mm. Mm-hmm. I'm very confused right now."
Mako says: "You're the Avatar,  and I'm an idiot."
Korra says: "Both are true."
Bolin says: "No ... way.  Thâ€‹e Avatar!"
