Kuvira says: "There is a grave injustice that must be corrected. As you all know, after the Hundred Year War, Avatar Aang,  along with Fire Lord Zuko, stole Earth Empire land and formed the United Republic.  This land belongs to the people of the Earth Empire and it's time to take it back! Republic City will be ours!"
Soldiers says: "All hail the Great Uniter!"
Kuvira says: "Are you ready to show the world what a true superpower looks like?"
Baatar Jr. says: "Yes. I'm honored to march into the city by your side.  I love you, Kuvira."
Kuvira says: "I never could have done this without your help. After we claim victory, we can finally get married  and rule our empire together."
