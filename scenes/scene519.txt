Varrick says: "Sorry we're late, everyone."
Bolin says: "Varrick!"
Asami says: "What are you doing here?"
Varrick says: "Great question, Asami. I mean, what are any of us doing here? Wow, food for thought. Any who, how's our company doing?"
Asami says: "You mean my company. Future Industries reverted back to me after you plotted to abduct the President."
Varrick says: "Allegedly plotted to abduct the President. Never convicted."
Mako says: "Uh, that's because you escaped prison."
Varrick says: "No, the universe decided to set me free. So, I looked up my old friend Suyin here, pitched her a few ideas,  and bam! We're in business together."
Suyin says: "Varrick's heading up my new technology division."
Varrick says: "I've seen the future, and the future is, magnets! I'm working on a high speed rail that would revolutionize transportation and shipping as we know it. But that's not all, I'm-"
Lin says: "All right, enough!  I'm trying to keep the Avatar safe and you're harboring a criminal?"
Suyin says: "Ease out, Lin. Sure Varrick's made a few mistakes in his past, but that doesn't mean he should pay for it for the rest of his life. My chef was a pirate, but now he's a culinary master. People change."
Lin says: "You haven't."
Korra says: "Lin!"
