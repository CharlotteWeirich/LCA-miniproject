Main Asami Sato Bolin Bumi Korra Kya Mako Tenzin Antagonists Dark spirits Desna and Eska Unalaq Vaatu says: "Minor Katara Naga Oogi Pabu Senna Tonraq"
Shiro Shinobi says: "After ten thousand years, Harmonic Convergence is here again, and the dark spirit Vaatu is free. Tenzin, Bumi, and Kya have entered the portal to rescue Jinora's spirit. Asami split from the group and took the injured Tonraq to safety. So it's up to Korra, Mako, and Bolin to stop Unalaq before he fuses with Vaatu and becomes a Dark Avatar."
