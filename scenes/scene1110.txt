Asami says: "If we don't find Wu soon, we might never find him."
Korra says: "He's on that train!"
Mako says: "How do you know for sure he's here?"
Korra says: "I don't. But I had a feeling, okay?"
Mako says: "And I'm just supposed to trust your "Avatar Feelings"?"
Korra says: "You wouldn't have to if you had guarded the prince like you were supposed to."
Mako says: "Oh, so it's my fault Wu disappeared."
Korra says: "It's certainly not mine!"
Asami says: "Guys, shh. Listen."
Mako says: "Wu! Wu, it's me."
Wu says: "Mako? Where am I? Am I dead?"
Mako says: "No, you're on a train. We're gonna get you out of here."
Korra says: "Everyone out."
Wu says: "I'm not going up there."
