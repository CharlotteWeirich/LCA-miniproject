Raiko says: "I say we deal with this Kuvira situation immediately."
Wu says: "Yes! Agreed! And I know just how to get rid of her: we tell her she won an all-expense paid vacation to a tropical island. Then, when she gets there, we reveal that it was a trap. The island's a prison! Boom! Got her!  Or, okay, uh, I'm just spitballing here. We march in with an army of highly trained badgermoles!  Do we know if Kuvira has any allergies?"
Raiko says: "Look, I think we all know what must be done. We take the fight to her."
Tenzin says: "I don't believe attacking is the right move, since she hasn't done anything aggressive toward the United Republic."
Lin says: "Not yet. But Kuvira can't be trusted. She told us that she was going to turn over power and she didn't. I'm with Raiko. I say we go on the offensive and start by retaking Zaofu."
Korra says: "President Raiko, I'm sorry to interrupt, but ...  What's going on here?"
Wu says: "Oh, hey, Avatar Korra. Just kickin' it world leader-style, trying to figure out what to do about Kuvira. For the record, I told Raiko he should've invited you."
