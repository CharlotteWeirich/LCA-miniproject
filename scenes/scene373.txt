Jinora says: "Daddy, you're home. We waited up for you. Is Korra okay?"
Tenzin says: "Yes, she's fine, sweetie."
Ikki says: "I was scared. I thought she wasn't coming back."
Tenzin says: "I'm sorry you were scared, but everything is going to be fine now. I promise."
Korra says: "Mmm. Mmm. The food tastes amazing, Pema. I'm finally starting to feel like myself again."
Pema says: "We're so thankful you're home safe."
Asami says: "Let me help."
Tenzin says: "Korra, I realize you've been through a lot, but I need to know everything that happened."
Korra says: "Well, first off, Tarrlok isn't who he says he is. He's Yakone's son."
Lin says: "It all makes sense now. That's how Tarrlok was able to bloodbend us without a full moon."
Tenzin says: "But how did you escape? And where's Tarrlok?"
Korra says: "Amon captured him,  and took his bending."
Tenzin says: "What?"
Korra says: "Yeah, he showed up out of nowhere. He almost got me, too."
Tenzin says: "This is very disturbing news. Amon is becoming emboldened. Taking out a councilman, almost capturing the Avatar ... I fear Amon is entering his endgame."
