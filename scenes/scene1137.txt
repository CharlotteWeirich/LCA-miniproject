Mako says: "Hey, can we talk?"
Korra says: "Of course."
Mako says: "There's something I've been wanting to tell you about that fight we had. I know I said it wasn't that bad, but, that's not exactly true. I, um ... I-I broke up with you."
Korra says: "I remember."
Mako says: "But, I thought you said you lost part of your memory."
Korra says: "I did, but being inside the Tree of Time brought it back. I'm sorry for blowing up at you."
Mako says: "That's okay.  I think we've both said things that we regret."
Korra says: "Why didn't you just tell me the truth in the first place?"
Mako says: "I know I should have, but ... I didn't wanna hurt you all over again. I guess part of me wanted to forget about the break-up too."
Korra says: "I think we both know that this. Us? Doesn't work."
Mako says: "You're right."
Korra says: "It's over.  For real this time."
Mako says: "I'll always love you, Korra."
Korra says: "And I'll always love you."
Bolin says: "You want a hug?"
