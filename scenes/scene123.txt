Shiro Shinobi says: "One round apiece:  who wants it more?  The Wolfbats fly out of the gates, swinging with bad intentions.  The challengers are showing a lot of heart but the champs are really starting to find their rhythm now.  Can the Ferrets hang in there with the best,  especially when the best are frankly getting a little help from the refs?  It's all down to this final round!  Mako is leaving it all in the ring  but it looks like Tahno and Ming are up to more shenanigans!  Oh, this has gone too far!  That water had rocks in it!"
Referee says: "Knockout!"
