Korra says: "Jump!"
Mako says: "You all right?"
Wu says: "Yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  You are definitely getting a raise, Buddy."
Mako says: "You should be thanking Korra. We never would have found you with out her."
Wu says: "I owe you my life, Avatar. If only there was some way to repay you. Oh, I know.  How about I take you out for a night on the town?"
Korra says: "Really? You're asking me out right now?"
Wu says: "So ... I put you down for a "maybe"?"
Korra says: "How about a never?"
Korra says: "Not exactly what I imagined for our first day back together."
Asami says: "But it was kind of like old times.  Except for the getting on each other's nerves part."
Mako says: "Actually, that is like old times for me and Korra."
Korra says: "I'm sorry things got so tense earlier."
Asami says: "It's all right. I guess after being apart for three years, there's bound to be a bit of an adjustment period."
Mako says: "Yeah, but it's great to have you back."
Korra says: "There's no place else I'd rather be."
Wu says: "You guys are the greatest friends a guy could have."
Korra says: "So, what are we gonna do with him? It's too dangerous to take him back to the hotel."
Wu says: "Whoo! You're telling me! I need a cushy safe house somewhere."
Mako says: "I think I know just the place."
