Tenzin says: "Wait.  I have done my best to guide Republic City toward the dream my father had for it, but you're right. It has fallen out of balance since he passed. I thought I should put off your training in order to uphold his legacy,  but you are his legacy.  You may stay and train airbending here with me.  Republic City needs its Avatar once again."
Korra says: "Yes! Thank you! You're the best!"
Meelo, Ikki, and Jinora says: "Yaaaaay!"
