Shiro Shinobi says: "Korra and Mako have discovered the truth about Amon's identity. He's a waterbender, a bloodbender, and brother to Tarrlok! Now, Korra and Mako plan to infiltrate the Equalists' victory rally and expose Amon as a fraud. Meanwhile, Asami, Bolin, and General Iroh head toward Hiroshi's secret airfield, where Asami intends to take down her father?"
Iroh says: "I think we've found our secret airfield.  Bolin, once we get down there, I need you to tear up those runways. We can't let those aircraft take off."
Bolin says: "Aye aye, captain!  Ooh, general, general.  All right, you guys wait here until we get back, okay?  Uh-uh, stay."
Asami says: "Why would there be fence posts but no fence?"
