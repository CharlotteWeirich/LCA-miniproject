Asami says: "Dear Korra. I miss you. It's not the same in Republic City without you. How are you feeling?  Things are going well here. I just got a big contract to help redesign the city's infrastructure, so I'll be keeping pretty busy for a while."
Mako says: "Hey, Korra! Sooo, I'm not very good at writing letters. It's 2:15 in the afternoon. Weather is fair. Chance of snow showers later today. But enough joking around.  I hope you're dong well. Me? I'm back on the beat. Beifong has me staking out the Red Monsoon hideout. You won't believe what's going down."
