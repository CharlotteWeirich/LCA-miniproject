Eska says: "Father, haven't the spirits had ten thousand years to open this portal?"
Desna says: "If they could not succeed, what makes you think we will?"
Unalaq says: "By entering the Spirit World through the portal, we bring with us something the spirits never had: our bending.  Join me! Together, we can open this portal."
Eska says: "Desna!"
Unalaq says: "Leave him! Keep bending!"
Eska says: "He needs a healer at once!"
Unalaq says: "This is more important!"
Eska says: "I'm taking him back."
