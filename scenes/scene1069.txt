Bumi says: "Wait a second."
Tenzin says: "What, do you hear something?"
Bumi says: "Yes. They're all around us. The cannibals, they're everywhere."
Tenzin says: "Bumi, you must focus your mind. Right now! There are no cannibals."
Bumi says: "Yes, there are! They're gonna eat every last one of us!"
Kya says: "Who are you two?"
Tenzin says: "Kya, we're your brothers. You must remember, before the fog infects you."
Kya says: "No, you're just a vision. I have no family. You can't tie me down."
Bumi says: "They're closing in! I gotta get out of here!"
Tenzin says: "No! Bumi! Kya! Come back!"
