Mako says: "Probably because they don't want just anyone waltzing in to their big  "Revelation",  whatever that is.  I bet the information is hidden on here somehow. Look at the backs.  There's four different images."
Korra says: "So,  it's a puzzle?"
Mako says: "Yeah, of a map!"
Mako says: "Bingo.  That must be where it's going down."
