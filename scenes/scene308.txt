Mako says: "Wu, we have to get you out of here!  Go! Go!"
Wu says: "What just happened out there?"
Mako says: "I think those were Kuvira's supporters in the crowd."
Wu says: "Oh no! Mako, I've been hit! It's a gusher!"
Mako says: "That's not blood. It's strawberry pie."
Wu says: "Oh. Yeah, you're right.  But that was close. I don't know what would have happened if you weren't there."
Mako says: "You would have been hit by a pie. It's really not that big of a deal."
Wu says: "Or I could have been killed! I don't know what I'd ever do without you! Wait a second. Did you say strawberry pie?  I'm allergic to strawberries!  I don't think I can breathe! Get me to the hospital! Wu down!"
Mako says: "You're allergic to bee stings!"
Wu says: "Oh. Yeah, you're right.  I always get those two mixed up."
