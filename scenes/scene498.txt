Ikki says: "Those soldiers said there weren't any troops here and, I figure, if Korra's not feeling good, she might come to a spiritual place like this to get better."
Jinora says: "There is an enormous amount of spiritual activity here, but I don't feel Korra."
Meelo says: "Well, that's what we get for listening to Ikki."
Ikki says: "Guys! We just got here. Let's at least look around."
Jinora says: "I'm sorry, Ikki, but I'm with Meelo on this. I don't think we're going to find her here. Let's go Pepper!"
Meelo says: "Why did those stupid vines pull us in here anyway?"
Ikki says: "Because they want us here. I'm telling you, Korra has got to be close."
Jinora says: "I don't know, Ikki, I still don't sense Korra."
Ikki says: "Well, you haven't sensed her the entire time we've been looking for her!"
Meelo says: "Next time I go on a mission, it's going to be boys only. Just Poki and me."
