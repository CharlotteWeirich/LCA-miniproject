Iroh says: "They say that the game of Pai Sho was invented by the spirits ... although some of them don't seem to grasp it very well."
Lotus spirit says: "Just hold on. I'm thinking."
Iroh says: "As you can see, it is a game that requires great patience. But time does not mean much to us here."
Korra says: "How long have you lived here?"
Iroh says: "Oh, I've been here for many years. I had always enjoyed the company of the spirits,  so when my work was done in the material world,  I chose to leave my body behind and come to the Spirit World! It can be a wonderful place, and I've made so many friends.  Korra, what's wrong?"
Korra says: "I came here with my friend, but I lost her and now I'm all alone."
Iroh says: "You're not alone Korra, it's okay."
Korra says: "No! It's not okay! Jinora's gone and I need to find her! She's lost, and we need to go home!  I don't like the Spirit World, I don't want to be here anymore!"
