Unalaq says: "Thank you for saving my life."
Korra says: "I'm just glad I got here in time."
Unalaq says: "Find Varrick. I want him to freeze in prison with the rest of these traitors."
Korra says: "Wait, you can't just lock them away. That will only make the South angrier."
Unalaq says: "You want them to go free?"
Korra says: "No. But let them stand trial for what they did. Every Water Tribe citizen deserves that right."
Unalaq says: "Very well. I will respect the Avatar's wishes in this matter."
Korra says: "Thank you, Uncle."
