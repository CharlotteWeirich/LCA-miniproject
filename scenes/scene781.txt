Lin says: "What did you find?"
Kuvira says: "We located the end of the tunnel, but there's no sign of him. Just some fresh tire tracks."
Mako says: "He had an escape plan all ready to go."
Suyin says: "I trusted him with my life. I thought we were family, but it was all a lie."
Mako says: "Whoever these guys are, they're more powerful than we thought, and more dangerous."
Korra says: "That's why we have to find them. We're going to hold off our search for airbenders and hunt down Aiwei. Naga can track his scent."
Asami says: "And I bet if we find Aiwei, we'll find Zaheer."
Lin says: "No! We're not hunting this group. There could be other secret agents in other parts of the world looking for you right now! I'm taking you back to Republic City, where I can protect you."
Korra says: "If I wasn't safe here, then I'm not safe anywhere. I have to stop them!"
Lin says: "It's too dangerous! You are not going!"
Korra says: "Stop trying to protect me! I'm the Avatar. This is my job!"
Lin says: "Don't lecture me about jobs!"
Suyin says: "Enough! Korra, listen to Lin."
Korra says: "But ... they ..."
Suyin says: "Please. Lin's only looking out for you. I promise you, Aiwei and everyone he's working with will be brought to justice."
Korra says: "Fine, if you really think it's best."
Suyin says: "I do."
Lin says: "Thank you, Su."
Suyin says: "Everyone should get some rest tonight. I'll have my people prep your airship and you can leave first thing in the morning."
