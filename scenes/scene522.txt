Bolin says: "Why are you acting weird?"
Opal says: "I don't like how you're talking to me."
Bolin says: "Look, I'm sorry. I just get really self-conscious when I know when a girl likes me, and I-I end up looking stupid."

Bolin says: "Oh no. But I though ... Mako said-"
Opal says: "Just kidding. But, do me a favor and stop trying.  Look, don't stop trying. Just stop trying so much. Just be yourself."
