Bolin says: "Hey there, Eska, I was wondering if we could talk."
Eska says: "I grant you permission to speak freely."
Bolin says: "Oh, good, because I just need to be honest with you. You know, when we first met, there was this crazy spark. But I'm starting to feel like that spark is fading."
Eska says: "I agree. It is as if a great chasm has formed between us and nothing can bridge it."
Bolin says: "Oh! Oh, yes! I'm so glad you understand!"
Eska says: "Nothing, that is, except marriage.  We will wed at sunset. You may express your joy through tears."
Bolin says: "Oh, no, I can't -  This is really tight."
