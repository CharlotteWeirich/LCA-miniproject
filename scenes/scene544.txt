Kuvira says: "What happened? Are we ... dead?"
Korra says: "No, we're okay, but we're in the Spirit World.  All the energy from your weapon tore open a new portal and blasted us in here."
Kuvira says: "Why would you save my life, after everything I did to you?"
Korra says: "I guess ... I see a lot of myself in you."
Kuvira says: "We are nothing alike!"
Korra says: "Yes, we are. We're both fierce and determined to succeed,  sometimes without thinking things through."
Kuvira says: "This wasn't how I wanted things to end.  If you would have all just surrendered,  none of this would have happened."
Korra says: "You brought this on yourself. Messing with the spirit vines, acting like a dictator over your people ... you had to know what you were doing wasn't right."
Kuvira says: "I was trying to help my people. Su turned her back on the Earth Kingdom, you were gone! I had to do something."
Korra says: "I think I get it now."
Kuvira says: "You don't understand anything about me."
Korra says: "I do.  Su told me how she took you in when you were younger.  It must have been so hard being an orphan."
Kuvira says: "Don't pretend you know what it felt like!  The Avatar is adored by millions! I was cast aside by my own parents like I meant nothing to them.  How could I just stand by  and watch the same thing happen to my nation, when it needed someone to guide it?"
Korra says: "You wanted to create a place where you and your people would never be vulnerable again.  I may not have been an orphan, but believe me, I understand what it feels like to be afraid.  After I was poisoned, I would have done anything to feel in control."
