Kai says: "Look! Baby bisons.  How come they're on the ground?"
Jinora says: "Air bison calves can't fly after a week or two after they're born. So the entire herd will stay near the ground, near the valley."
Kai says: "Let's go see the babies."
Jinora says: "Be careful. The mothers are very protective."
Kai says: "Aww, look how cute!"
Jinora says: "Kai, get out of there!"
Kai says: "Wow, you really saved me down there. You know, you're an incredible airbender."
Jinora says: "Well, I've been training for a long time."
Kai says: "Then, why don't you have tattoos like an airbending master?"
Jinora says: "My dad says I'm not a master yet."
Kai says: "You can do everything your dad can.  Plus, you have all these spirit-y powers. If anyone's a master, you are."
