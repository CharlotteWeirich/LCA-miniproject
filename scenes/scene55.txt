Bumi says: "Looks like someone's trying to take your place as the Avatar's stick-in-the-mud mentor."
Kya says: "Bumi, don't pick on Tenzin. You know he's always been sensitive."
Tenzin says: "I'm not sensitive!"
Unalaq says: "As your chief, it is my honor to speak at this festival, which was founded to bring our tribes together and restore the ancient balance between our world and that of the spirits. But I am saddened to see what it has become: a cheap carnival that celebrates greedy and trivial humans.  I feel the time is fast approaching when the North can no longer stand idly by while our Southern brothers slip into total spiritual decay. Angry spirits are already attacking ships in your waters. I only hope we are not too late to change course."
Varrick says: "Chief Unalaq everybody, always great to have him in town. Now, let's have some fun with Wacky Wushu's Dancing Otter penguins!"
