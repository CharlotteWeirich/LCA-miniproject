Bumi says: "Jinora. Jinora's spirit do you hear me?  It's your Uncle Bumi."
Tenzin says: "Ah, this isn't working. We can't just randomly wander the Spirit World, call out for Jinora, and expect to find her."
Bumi says: "We just need to employ the simply rules of tracking.  First we locate her footprints ... then we follow them."
Kya says: "Do you even know what spirit footprints look like? Do spirits even leave footprints? Face it, your tracking skills won't work in the Spirit World.  Let me try something.  Jinora is over there.  I feel a lot of spiritual energy coming from that direction."
Bumi says: "We're in the Spirit World. There's spiritual energy in every direction."
Tenzin says: "Enough!  We can't do this by ourselves. We need a spirit guide."
Tenzin says: "There.  Spirit, hello.  I'm sorry to disturb you, but I am in need of your assistance."
Dark Spider Spirit says: "You dare wake me, human? Humans in the Spirit World belong in one place only."
