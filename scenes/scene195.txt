Bolin says: "Whoa, that's one big ... thing."
Toph says: "I think I know where they are. Feel that cavern a few stories down? It seems empty, but it's guarded by an awful lot of mech."
Lin says: "Right. Why would you need soldiers guarding an empty cavern? They must have them in some kind of suspended prison, so they can't use their earthbending."
Bolin says: "Someone's coming. Hide!"
Baatar Jr. says: "I didn't expect you until tomorrow."
Kuvira says: "I just wanted to check in to make sure everything was on track. It looks wonderful."
Baatar Jr. says: "We've had a few minor malfunctions, but we should be ready for the test tomorrow."
Kuvira says: "You've been working on this the entire time, Zhu Li. What do you think the problem is?"
Zhu Li says: "It's a very complex machine. There are bound to be some bugs to work out."
Kuvira says: "But you're doing everything you can to fix those, correct?"
Zhu Li says: "Of course, your eminence."
