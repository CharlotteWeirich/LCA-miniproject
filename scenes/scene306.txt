Bolin says: "We just got some good news.  Two more Earth Kingdom states have agreed to join us."
Baatar Jr. says: "Excellent! Thank you, Bolin.  We're ninety percent there, Kuvira."
Varrick says: "That's great! Zhu Li, dish out some of that special celebration tea!"
Kuvira says: "None for me. I won't celebrate until the Earth Kingdom is one hundred percent reunited."
Kuvira says: "Why have we stopped?"
Driver says: "Apologies. There are rocks on the tracks. It's most likely bandits. We're sending troops to handle the situation."
Kuvira says: "Call them off. I will take care of the bandits myself."
