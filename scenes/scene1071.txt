Tenzin says: "You must stay focused. Remember who you are Tenzin. You are the son of Avatar Aang. You are the hope for future generations of airbenders. The fate of the world rests on your shoulders. But what if I fail?  Then your father's hopes of the future dies with you. I can't fail. You will.  Ah, stop it! I am the son of Avatar Aang. I am the hope for future generations of airbenders. I am the son of Avatar Aang."
Aang's image says: "Hello, my son."
Tenzin says: "Dad,  I've failed you. I am no spiritual leader, and I've let the world down. I'll never be the man you were."
Aang's image says: "You are right.  You are trying to hold on to a false perception of yourself. You are not me and you should not be me. You are Tenzin."
Tenzin says: "I am not a reflection of my father. I am Tenzin.  I am Tenzin!"
Tenzin says: "Jinora!"
Bumi says: "Huh? What happened?"
Kya says: "I think our brother saved us."
Jinora says: "Dad."
Tenzin says: "You'll be okay sweetie. I'm here."
Jinora says: "What happened? The last thing I remembered was dark spirits taking me away."
Tenzin says: "You were trapped in the Fog of Lost Souls. And I wasn't going to let you stay there."
Jinora says: "I'm so happy to see you, Dad."
