Korra says: "How's the evacuation coming?"
Wu says: "Could be better.  At this point we've evacuated almost ...  eighteen families."
Korra says: "Only eighteen? There are millions of people in this city!"
Wu says: "I said it could be better."
Mako says: "The problem is, it's a voluntary evacuation and there aren't very many volunteers. They just don't feel like they're in any immediate danger."
Bolin says: "Guys! Good, you're all here!"
Raiko says: "What's with you interrupting my important meetings all the time?"
Korra says: "Su ... what are you ... you're okay!  I'm so sorry about Zaofu. How did you escape?"
Bolin says: "Opal, Beifong, and I rescued everyone. But we had a run in with Kuvira. We saw her super spirit weapon up close. Like, really close. Way too close."
Tenzin says: "Is she going to use it against Republic City?"
Zhu Li says: "Yes. I found out she's going to attack in two weeks."
Bolin says: "Ooh! And Zhu Li's on our side now. Actually, she never really switched sides and I'm just gonna let her explain the whole thing. Zhu Li?"
Zhu Li says: "I pretended to be loyal to Kuvira so I could sabotage her weapon. It didn't work, but I did overhear her plans to attack."
Raiko says: "I knew she wouldn't stop at Zaofu."
Lin says: "My guess is, she's coming by rail. It's the only way she can transport that weapon."
Korra says: "Then we'll cut the rail lines."
Raiko says: "I agree. But let's get as many citizens evacuated before we do.  Put out the announcement. The evacuation is now mandatory."
Mako says: "We're on it."
Korra says: "Don't worry Mr. President. I won't let Kuvira take our city."
