Mako says: "What's up with the coat? And where did you get that pie?"
Bolin says: "It's a Varrick ship, you never know what you're gonna find. There's a whole level filled with fun-house mirrors. Of course, there's also the catgator deck.  I miss that guy, he really knew how to make a long trip interesting. So, have you told Korra yet about how  you guys broke up, and you kinda started dating Asami while she was off getting attacked by dark spirits?"
Mako says: "Will you keep it down? I'm waiting for the right moment."
Bolin says: "Oh Mako, you know a wise man once told me that delivering bad news to a girlfriend was like ripping off a blood-sucking leech: you just have to do it fast and get it over with."
Mako says: "I hate it when you listen to me. Fine!"
Tenzin says: "Unalaq will be waiting for you. You'll need all of your Avatar power to stop him."
Korra says: "I'm going to close the spirit portals, lock Vaatu in for another ten thousand years, and make Unalaq wish he'd never been born."
