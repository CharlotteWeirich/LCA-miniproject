Tenzin says: "We're walking in circles,  I've seen that same spirit mushroom five times."
Bumi says: "That's not the same mushroom."
Spirit mushroom says: "Yes I am."
Tenzin says: "See? Even it knows we're lost."
Bumi says: "Oh sure, listen to a fungus over your own brother."
Kya says: "What's that?"
Bumi says: "Mushroom? Is that you?"
Spirit mushroom says: "No, wasn't me."
