Mako says: "Right here, I found him slipping away."
Kai says: "I was just going to the bathroom."
Mako says: "With your stash of gold?"
Kai says: "I told you, I found this on the road."
Mako says: "Enough with the lies kid. I want the truth."
Earth Kingdom sheriff says: "The truth is, he's the outlaw. He spent an entire life in an orphanage, got adopted by a real nice family six months ago, and how did he repay them? By taking their entire life savings. We've been after him ever since."
Korra says: "Is that true?"
Kai says: "The person who stole that stuff was the old me. Once I got airbending, I changed. I don't know how to explain it, but I feel like airbending choose me for a reason , like I'm a new person. I'm sorry! Please, you have to listen to me."
Bolin says: "Are, are you taking him back to the orphanage?"
Earth Kingdom sheriff says: "No, he's headed to jail."
Korra says: "Wait! You've got the family's life savings, now let us take Kai."
Tenzin says: "Do you really want our first member of the Air Nation to be a liar and a thief?"
Korra says: "He just needs some guidance, Tenzin. Who better to give it to him than us?"
Earth Kingdom sheriff says: "Do you want this boy or not?"
Tenzin says: "Yes, you can release the boy into our custody."
Kai says: "Thank you!"
Korra says: "Don't make me regret it."
Bolin says: "Welcome to the family, little bro."
