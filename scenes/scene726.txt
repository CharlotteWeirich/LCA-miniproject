Unalaq says: "You're early."
Korra says: "What can I say? I'm pumped up to learn that Unalaq spirit fighting."
Unalaq says: "I'm not here to teach you to fight spirits, I'm here to help you begin your spiritual training. We're going to one of the most remote places in the world, the long neglected spiritual center of your tribe, the South Pole."
Korra says: "You're going to train me at the South Pole?"
Unalaq says: "We will do more than just train. By neglecting the spirits, the people of the South have brought darkness upon themselves, and now it threatens to destroy our tribe. We must set things right. The Southern Water Tribe depends on you."
Korra says: "A dangerous trip to the South Pole? Count me in!"
