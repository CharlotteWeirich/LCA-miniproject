<b>Green Lantern
~ The Animated series ~</b>

2
00:00:20,713 --> 00:00:22,302
<i>Previously on Green Lantern...</i>

3
00:00:22,847 --> 00:00:24,410
For the greater good...

4
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:26,298
...and vengeance!

5
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:32,029
I'm the one responsible
for all this death and destruction!

6
00:00:32,306 --> 00:00:34,817
Which is why you're going to help
make up for it.

7
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:41,934
<b>Season 1, episode 3:
"Razer's Edge"</b>

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,656
You like looking at that stuff,
"Boozer"?

9
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,147
You proud of what you did?

10
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:53,146
How many of you Red Lanterns
are out there?

11
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:55,059
And why are you hunting
Green Lanterns?

12
00:00:57,146 --> 00:00:58,276
Answer me!

13
00:00:58,282 --> 00:01:00,946
Easy there, Kilowog!
This thing's a rental, remember?

14
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:09,407
The Red Lanterns abandoned you,
Razer.

15
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,691
Left you for dead.

16
00:01:10,698 --> 00:01:12,493
I think that calls for a little payback,
don't you?

17
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,002
Help us.
Tell us what you know.

18
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:18,109
I do hate the Red Lanterns
for what they've made me.

19
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:20,997
But that doesn't mean
I stopped hating Green Lanterns.

20
00:01:21,263 --> 00:01:23,650
It just means
I have more people to hate.

21
00:01:26,447 --> 00:01:28,191
<i>Hal Jordan stole the Interceptor.</i>

22
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:31,247
<i>And you wish to reward him
by giving him command of it?</i>

23
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:33,032
<i>Appa, we have no choice.</i>

24
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:35,816
<i>They are our only line of defense
on the Frontier.</i>

25
00:01:36,186 --> 00:01:37,625
<i>Besides, at that distance,</i>

26
00:01:37,626 --> 00:01:40,681
<i>there's very little we can do
to punish Jordan, anyway.</i>

27
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,208
<i>Then, we are of one mind.</i>

28
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:45,886
<i>The crew of the Interceptor
is tasked with gathering intelligence</i>

29
00:01:45,887 --> 00:01:47,096
<i>on the Red Lantern threat</i>

30
00:01:47,097 --> 00:01:50,729
<i>and taking reasonable action
to slow their advance.</i>

31
00:01:50,896 --> 00:01:52,581
<i>We may be of one mind,</i>

32
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:54,189
<i>but only on the protest.</i>

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,869
<i>Now. What is the status
of the Red Lantern's ring?</i>

34
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:59,366
Safe.
In a stasis box.

35
00:02:00,624 --> 00:02:02,438
Yeah, the ring doesn't take
that much room.

36
00:02:02,673 --> 00:02:04,506
Unfortunately, Razer does.

37
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,425
What do you suggest
we do with him?

38
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:08,969
<i>Even you know your duty,
Hal Jordan.</i>

39
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:10,822
<i>He must be imprisoned.</i>

40
00:02:13,074 --> 00:02:16,651
Fools! For what I have done,
they should execute me.

41
00:02:17,523 --> 00:02:20,346
<i>I do not understand
your desire for self-destruction.</i>

42
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:22,156
<i>If one regret's one's actions,</i>

43
00:02:22,157 --> 00:02:24,301
<i>one should find a way
to make restitution.</i>

44
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,695
I'm not about to debate this
with a computer!

45
00:02:28,117 --> 00:02:30,550
- Any orders?
- Yeah, find me a prison.

46
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:34,135
It's not like we can just drop Razer off
on a handy Lantern science cell.

47
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:37,061
<i>Frontier Lanterns
use privatized penitentiaries.</i>

48
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:40,012
<i>- I can compile all the detailed places...
- That won't be necessary, Aya.</i>

49
00:02:40,037 --> 00:02:42,926
- Just something nearby.
- But nothing too nice.

50
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:04,914
Wow, she really took you at your word
about the "nothing too nice" thing.

51
00:03:05,012 --> 00:03:06,257
It ain't that bad...

52
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:08,618
Are you kidding?
This place gives me the creeps.

53
00:03:09,677 --> 00:03:12,614
It's like fear radiates
from the walls.

54
00:03:13,134 --> 00:03:15,416
It's a dark dang repulsive hall
full of...

55
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:16,679
Spiders!

56
00:03:16,757 --> 00:03:18,543
I was gonna say "rats", but...

57
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:19,871
Oh...

58
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,305
Well, well...
Green Lanterns!

59
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,994
It's been a long time since
we hosted a prisoner

60
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:31,878
for our esteemed
colleagues in justice.

61
00:03:31,894 --> 00:03:33,261
I take it you're the warden?

62
00:03:33,591 --> 00:03:37,008
I am Myglom. I operate this prison
on behalf of the Spider Guild.

63
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:41,248
Aah... it appears
you have something for me.

64
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,281
This piece of work is Razer.

65
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:46,453
We have documented evidence
of his crimes against sentient...

66
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:49,272
Oh, I'm quite confident
he's guilty.

67
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,413
No one has ever escaped
from this facility.

68
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:54,350
I'm very proud of that...

69
00:03:54,377 --> 00:03:57,790
But I'm even more proud
of our rehabilitation program.

70
00:03:58,365 --> 00:04:01,761
You'll find that nearly 100%
of our former... guests

71
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,599
never returned to a life of crime.

72
00:04:04,675 --> 00:04:06,104
Well, I'm sold!

73
00:04:06,105 --> 00:04:09,767
Myglom, we hereby officially
remand custody of Razer to your care.

74
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:14,089
That's one Red Lantern down...

75
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,727
More where that came from...

76
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,275
Make yourself comfortable,
prisoner...

77
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:34,946
I doubt very much
that these machines will be able to...

78
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:36,785
...rehabilitate me.

79
00:04:36,872 --> 00:04:38,698
Oh, don't be concerned
with any of these.

80
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:41,857
Soon you'll find yourself far...

81
00:04:41,858 --> 00:04:43,186
...far away.

82
00:04:48,965 --> 00:04:50,413
I don't know about you,

83
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:53,390
but I'm gonna sleep a whole lot easier
knowing that guy ain't on board.

84
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:55,845
Now we can get back
to nailing those Red...

85
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:58,374
...Lanterns.

86
00:04:58,577 --> 00:05:00,418
- Did you see that?
- What?

87
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:02,969
Out the window?
In space...?

88
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,741
There!
Right there!

89
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:08,256
Right where?

90
00:05:08,596 --> 00:05:11,075
I am not crazy!
I saw something there!

91
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:17,620
What is up with you?

92
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,843
Fan out.
Our hitchhiker's hiding somewhere.

93
00:05:47,684 --> 00:05:49,021
Will you stay out of my way?

94
00:05:49,073 --> 00:05:50,866
We're going about this all wrong!

95
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:52,430
Whatever it is, it's intelligent.

96
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:54,392
It's watching us
and staying one step ahead.

97
00:05:54,393 --> 00:05:57,137
- Why are you yelling at me?
- To cause a distraction,

98
00:05:57,138 --> 00:05:58,431
so I can do this!

99
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,139
OK, squid, start talking.

100
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,166
Kilowog here loves seafood
and has a big appetite.

101
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,700
- What? - It's an old
interrogation method from Earth.

102
00:06:21,894 --> 00:06:23,315
Good cop, hungry cop.

103
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,564
Goggan will not go back!
Cannot go back!

104
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:30,778
Destroy me, but do not take me
back to the grim rock!

105
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:33,112
Do the lockage like my worst?

106
00:06:33,364 --> 00:06:35,602
Wait... ugly and nuts!

107
00:06:35,651 --> 00:06:38,035
You escaped
from the Spider Guild's prison.

108
00:06:38,193 --> 00:06:40,641
Yes... with this!

109
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:43,210
Goggan cannot... from here!

110
00:06:43,906 --> 00:06:45,279
And insane, saneeee!

111
00:06:45,314 --> 00:06:48,792
Goggan rid the airshaft
and flew!

112
00:06:48,793 --> 00:06:50,647
Still sane...

113
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,288
You shouldn't have bothered,
nut job!

114
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:55,024
Cause you're just going right back
to prison, where you belong!

115
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:57,179
No...
Please, no!

116
00:06:57,467 --> 00:07:00,738
Mercy!
Not back to nightmare rock!

117
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:02,894
Goggan lives his pain there.

118
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,483
Torture...

119
00:07:04,484 --> 00:07:06,440
Goggan is a child to handhold

120
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:08,338
the worst of fates!

121
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:11,036
Again... and again...

122
00:07:11,093 --> 00:07:13,187
What? The squid con
would say anything

123
00:07:13,188 --> 00:07:14,499
to stay out of prison!

124
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,528
- And if he's telling the truth?
- Razer's worse than a criminal.

125
00:07:17,568 --> 00:07:19,669
If the spiders wanna
torture him, let 'em!

126
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:22,576
It's our job, our duty
to serve and protect.

127
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,381
Even if they're criminals.

128
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:27,021
<i>Intriguing!
The criminals must be punished.</i>

129
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:29,412
<i>Surely prisoners deserve their fate.</i>

130
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:32,497
They deserve justice, which
sometimes involves punishment.

131
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,832
But not torture.

132
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:37,173
Look... We've got to take...
this back, anyway, so...

133
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:39,016
We'll have a look around.

134
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,356
OK. But even if there is
something wrong with the prison,

135
00:07:42,454 --> 00:07:44,550
it's not like Myglom's
gonna let us see it!

136
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:46,654
They'll clean up their act
as soon as they'll see us coming!

137
00:07:46,714 --> 00:07:48,969
That's why they're not going
to see us coming.

138
00:07:49,162 --> 00:07:50,899
Please, don't say it...

139
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,285
We're going to break
in to prison.

140
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:14,423
It's worse than death!

141
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:16,508
Infinity upon infinity...

142
00:08:16,551 --> 00:08:17,806
You mustn't go!

143
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:20,576
Don't worry, Goggan,
just taking a quick look around.

144
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:21,935
Dinner's in two hours.

145
00:08:22,049 --> 00:08:24,827
If we're not back, start without us,
because we're probably dead.

146
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,345
We really doin' this?

147
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,064
Really?

148
00:08:55,196 --> 00:08:56,507
The fighting is stopped.

149
00:08:56,587 --> 00:08:58,521
For now.
They'll be back.

150
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:00,258
The warlords always come back.

151
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:02,312
Maybe someday
they'll leave us alone.

152
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:05,679
The Forgotten Zone will be a place
where we can raise a family...

153
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:07,785
Without worry...

154
00:09:08,688 --> 00:09:09,957
Without fear...

155
00:09:12,555 --> 00:09:14,115
I'm going to help
make that happen.

156
00:09:14,617 --> 00:09:15,834
By joining the Militia.

157
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,260
Razer, no!

158
00:09:17,287 --> 00:09:18,517
Please, no!

159
00:09:18,707 --> 00:09:21,444
I'm sick of hiding,
while the warlords take what they want.

160
00:09:21,802 --> 00:09:23,257
You think more fighting will help?

161
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:26,406
Our people need teachers
and doctors and builders.

162
00:09:26,697 --> 00:09:28,000
Not more soldiers!

163
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:29,715
I'll gain power in the Militia

164
00:09:29,793 --> 00:09:31,229
and protect everyone.

165
00:09:32,668 --> 00:09:35,102
Especially the ones
I care about most.

166
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,988
We should check out
the accommodations.

167
00:09:54,483 --> 00:09:55,820
Well, there's no view...

168
00:09:56,377 --> 00:09:57,959
But there's clearly entertainment.

169
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,026
For the guards, anyway.

170
00:10:00,403 --> 00:10:01,949
We don't know that stuff's for torture!

171
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,868
This could be the rehabilitation
that Myglom talked about.

172
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,711
Whoever was being rehabilitated here
was scratching desperately to escape.

173
00:10:10,158 --> 00:10:12,247
These yellow stones are everywhere.

174
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,652
They make my skin crawl.

175
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:16,669
I've never seen you scared before.

176
00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:18,711
I ain't scared of no rocks!

177
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:21,200
Let's get out of here.

178
00:10:29,073 --> 00:10:32,161
I'm almost 90% sure
I remembered to charge it this time!

179
00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:50,495
Ilana!

180
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,149
Dar...

181
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,656
I came back for you...

182
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:04,870
I came back!

183
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:09,605
I came back for you...

184
00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:17,071
Rings are still down.

185
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:18,477
It makes no sense.

186
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,693
They're charged, but the only thing
working is the universal translator!

187
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,261
Something's interfering with them.

188
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:25,330
My Green Lantern friends...

189
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,683
I'm shocked,
shocked to find you

190
00:11:28,684 --> 00:11:30,616
in this untore position.

191
00:11:30,842 --> 00:11:32,114
Well, then cut us down.

192
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:33,756
I'm afraid, not.

193
00:11:34,097 --> 00:11:37,139
Now that you've seen our...
humane cells.

194
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,513
Oh, your rings won't work here.

195
00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:44,672
You must have noticed
this unusual metal, hm?

196
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,381
We stumbled upon a rich range of it nearby.

197
00:11:48,002 --> 00:11:50,207
Not only does it
power and light the facility,

198
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,011
it has an interesting side effect.

199
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,961
It nullifies the energy

200
00:11:54,962 --> 00:11:57,437
of a Green Lantern Power Ring.

201
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,790
So you do run a gulag,
after all.

202
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:01,401
Not at all...

203
00:12:02,038 --> 00:12:03,651
We don't torture
the prisoners here!

204
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:06,369
Not in the...
traditional sense.

205
00:12:15,258 --> 00:12:16,752
These devices

206
00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:18,290
force the wearer to relive

207
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,785
their worst moments

208
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:21,323
again and again.

209
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:23,801
So, that's what you got
in store for us?

210
00:12:24,181 --> 00:12:25,728
A couple of bad dreams?

211
00:12:26,008 --> 00:12:27,530
Oh, no, no...

212
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:29,515
The memories
are only the beginning!

213
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:31,777
After we treat our prisoners...

214
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,033
Then, we eat them.

215
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:48,751
They're dead by now.

216
00:12:48,752 --> 00:12:50,884
We must leave, leave,
before we're found!

217
00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:52,990
<i>Negative.
We will continue to wait.</i>

218
00:12:53,343 --> 00:12:55,381
The one said
he'd be back before dinner,

219
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:56,778
two hours ago!

220
00:12:57,184 --> 00:12:58,569
Dinner time has past.
Dead!

221
00:12:58,831 --> 00:13:00,059
<i>There is a high probability</i>

222
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,178
<i>that Hal was attempting
to be humorous.</i>

223
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,475
If they're not dead yet,
they will be soon!

224
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,228
Worse than dead, even!

225
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:09,103
<i>Unacceptable.</i>

226
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:11,558
<i>Action must be taken
to rescue the Green Lanterns.</i>

227
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:13,186
<i>Even at risk to this unit.</i>

228
00:13:17,748 --> 00:13:18,966
Computer?

229
00:13:44,348 --> 00:13:45,460
But...

230
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:46,940
But I came back for you.

231
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:48,407
I came back!

232
00:13:49,552 --> 00:13:51,041
I came back for you...

233
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:55,393
I came back for you!

234
00:13:58,008 --> 00:14:00,314
<i>Razer,
of The Forgotten Zone</i>

235
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:03,975
<i>You have great rage
in your heart.</i>

236
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:09,150
<i>You belong to
The Red Lantern Corps.</i>

237
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:10,839
<i>Give in...</i>

238
00:14:11,072 --> 00:14:13,254
<i>The Ring knows your pain...</i>

239
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:16,927
Someone must pay!

240
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:22,889
<i>You'll have your revenge...</i>

241
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:24,144
<i>This,</i>

242
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:26,613
<i>your new Master,
Atrocitous,</i>

243
00:14:26,614 --> 00:14:28,464
<i>promises.</i>

244
00:14:56,082 --> 00:14:57,802
Razer, listen to me.

245
00:14:58,093 --> 00:14:59,579
None of this is real.

246
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,752
This is not really happening.

247
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,932
Do not panic.
I am the Aya program.

248
00:15:09,062 --> 00:15:10,810
I know this is a fantasy.

249
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:13,368
An illusion,
meant to bring me pain.

250
00:15:13,486 --> 00:15:14,834
You know...
Then, why...?

251
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:18,123
The memories keep replaying,
over and over, in my head.

252
00:15:18,444 --> 00:15:19,578
They hurt.

253
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:20,921
But I don't mind.

254
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,691
I get to see her again.

255
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,939
Even if
it's for one more moment.

256
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:26,706
I do not understand.

257
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:29,117
Pray you'll never do.

258
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:30,446
I need your help.

259
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:33,032
I cannot save Hal and Kilowog
without you.

260
00:15:33,437 --> 00:15:35,643
Some force is keeping me
out of the prison.

261
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:37,324
The prison?

262
00:15:37,452 --> 00:15:39,437
What are the Green Lanterns
even doing here?

263
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:41,802
They've heard the prisoners
are being tortured here.

264
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:43,557
And Hal thought
it was unacceptable.

265
00:15:43,781 --> 00:15:45,520
They came back here
to investigate.

266
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,022
And to save you,
if that was true.

267
00:15:48,206 --> 00:15:49,425
They shouldn't have done that.

268
00:15:49,635 --> 00:15:51,256
I deserve to be here.

269
00:15:51,547 --> 00:15:53,434
I helped destroying
an entire world.

270
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:55,851
All those people died
because of me.

271
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,482
No. Kilowog was able
to rescue the settlers

272
00:15:58,483 --> 00:16:00,762
before the world
was destroyed.

273
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:03,488
What?
Then, I didn't...

274
00:16:03,894 --> 00:16:05,050
It doesn't matter.

275
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:07,013
I'm still the one
who pressed the button.

276
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:09,318
In my heart,
I'm guilty of murder.

277
00:16:09,757 --> 00:16:11,432
I'm going to stay here...

278
00:16:12,451 --> 00:16:14,113
What you want is irrelevant.

279
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:25,428
I will never forgive this.

280
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,285
<i>I have seen your past,
and know your pain.</i>

281
00:16:28,516 --> 00:16:30,078
No one knows my pain!

282
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:32,163
Certainly, not a machine.

283
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:42,952
Where, now?

284
00:16:42,983 --> 00:16:45,709
<i>Some force is preventing me
from exploring this direction.</i>

285
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:48,357
<i>I believe this is where
they are keeping Hal and Kilowog.</i>

286
00:16:48,938 --> 00:16:50,122
And the other way?

287
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:52,039
<i>That is the path
back to the ship.</i>

288
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,012
No!

289
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:55,746
<i>You cannot leave them
to die!</i>

290
00:17:01,327 --> 00:17:02,501
Enough!

291
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:05,752
These two need
but little tenderizing.

292
00:17:06,101 --> 00:17:08,532
Green Lantern is best eaten...

293
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:10,101
fresh.

294
00:17:15,596 --> 00:17:17,542
And what are you
supposed to be?

295
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:19,886
I am Goggan.
Are we leaving?

296
00:17:48,412 --> 00:17:49,834
Great timing, kid!

297
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:14,214
We just got our butt saved
by a Red Lantern.

298
00:18:14,313 --> 00:18:15,549
I noticed.

299
00:18:15,651 --> 00:18:16,935
We gonna stand for that?

300
00:18:16,944 --> 00:18:18,223
No!

301
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,091
Oh, you want some boozer?

302
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,542
Cause there's plenty for everyone!

303
00:18:37,231 --> 00:18:39,237
You weren't gonna leave
without saying "goodbye".

304
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:42,092
No... You have it
all wrong, Green Lantern!

305
00:19:10,646 --> 00:19:13,554
I was kicking butt long before
I ever got this ring.

306
00:19:13,734 --> 00:19:16,140
And I've been squashing bugs
even longer.

307
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,950
Myglom has been capture in the jail, sir.

308
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,163
Like you ordered!

309
00:19:58,183 --> 00:20:00,219
The Guardians have dispatched
a new warden.

310
00:20:00,343 --> 00:20:01,843
He should arrive
in 18 months.

311
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:03,401
In the meantime...

312
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:05,527
I'm designating
a temporary warden.

313
00:20:05,994 --> 00:20:07,389
Congratulations, Goggan.

314
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:10,088
I'm leaving the prison in your capable...
hand...

315
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,241
...things.

316
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,898
I trust you can free the prisoners
from their cocoons?

317
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,030
Yes... yes!
Of course, I...

318
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,954
No one will ever be tortured here
again!

319
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:24,530
You know, for a second, I thought
you were gonna make Razer the warden.

320
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:28,471
Are you crazy? I couldn't possibly leave
a Red Lantern in charge of this place.

321
00:20:31,052 --> 00:20:32,554
Because
he's coming with us.

322
00:20:43,226 --> 00:20:45,336
You know how that thing
the Spiders used

323
00:20:45,337 --> 00:20:48,395
made you relive
your absolute worst moments?

324
00:20:48,412 --> 00:20:49,602
Yeah...?

325
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:51,988
I got a new one.

326
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:59,762
<i>You do not seem
to have recovered from your ordeal.</i>

327
00:21:00,748 --> 00:21:02,367
You have seen my past.

328
00:21:02,564 --> 00:21:03,833
It is private.

329
00:21:04,218 --> 00:21:07,278
<i>The intrusion was necessary
to ensure the crew's survival.</i>

330
00:21:07,453 --> 00:21:09,626
You are an artificial intelligence.

331
00:21:10,256 --> 00:21:12,568
But you risked your existence
to save them.

332
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,847
A Green Lantern
would do no less.
