00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,444
the four nations lived
together in harmony.

8
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:17,449
then everything changed
when the fire nation attacked.

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,653
only the avatar,
master of all four elements
could stop them.

10
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,489
but when the world
needed him most

11
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,457
he vanished.

12
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:29,228
100 years passed and my brother
and i discovered the new avatar

13
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,063
an airbender named aang.

14
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,399
and although his airbending
skills were great

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,635
he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.

16
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:40,939
but i believe aang
can save the world.

it's gonna be great to hang out
on the beach and do nothing.

33
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,458
doing nothing
is a waste of time.

we're being sent away

don't take it personally.

00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,404
doesn't your family have
a house on ember island?

00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,439
we used to come every

that you were forced
to come here this weekend.

55
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,433

is a magical place

keep an open mind.

give it a chance.

00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,832
that's a sharp
outfit, chan... careful.

168
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:30,703
you could puncture the hull
of an empire-class
fire nation battleship

169
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,138
leaving thousands
to drown at sea...

170
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,875
because it so sharp.

171
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,546
um... thanks.

172
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:49,321
hey, first ones here, huh?

173
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,825
he thinks he's so great.

174
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,294
well, what do
you think of him?

175
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,096
i don't have any
opinion about him.

176
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,597
i hardly know him.

177
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,500
you like him,
don't you?
[irritated sigh]

178
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,708
so how do you know ty lee?

179
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,043
i met her at the beach today.

180
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:14,013
she was pretty impressed
by a sand pagoda
that i made for her.

181
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,249
well, i met her first.

182
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,886
look, it doesn't matter
who i met first
'cause i like you all.

183
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,022
<i>but which one of us
do you like?</i>

184
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,923
yeah.
tell us.

185
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,226
i don't know, i don't know.

186
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:29,862
[all grunt]

187
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:30,396
all: ooh.

188
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,331
ahh...

189
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,166
oh, i'm glad you're here.

190
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,235
those boys won't
leave me alone.

191
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,270
i guess they all
just like me too much.

192
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,540
come on, ty lee,
you can't be this ignorant.

193
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,242
what are you talking about?

194
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,512
those boys only like you because
you make it so easy for them.

195
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,681
you're not a challenge-
you're a tease.

196
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,250
it's not like they
actually care who you are.

197
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,085
[sobbing]

198
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:56,155
ok, ok, calm down.

199
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:59,124
i didn't mean what i said.

200
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,360
look, maybe i just said it
because i was a little...

201
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:02,327
[whispers]: jealous.

202
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,196
what?

203
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,731
you were jealous of me?

204
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:10,235
um, but, you're the most
beautiful, smartest, perfect
girl in the world.

205
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,704
well, you're right
about all those things.

206
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,672
but for some reason
when i meet boys

207
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,008
they act as if i'm going to do
something horrible to them.

208
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:19,511
[laughs] but you probably
would do something
horrible to them.

209
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:23,082
i'm sure they're
just intimidated by you.

210
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,651
ok, look, if you want
a boy to like you

211
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,453
just look at him and smile a lot

212
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,356
and laugh at everything he says
even if it's not funny.

213
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:35,027
well, that sounds
really shallow and stupid.

214
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,161
let's try it.

215
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,563
ok.

216
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,898
[as boy]: "hey, there,
sweet sugar cakes.

217
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,201
how ya likin' this party?"

218
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,636
[laughs giddily]

219
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,105
[silence]

220
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,308
mai: i'm bored.
zuko: i know.

221
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,910
i'm hungry.
so what?

222
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,879
so find me some food.

223
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,314
sure.

224
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,086
chan, i'm ready for
a tour of the house.

225
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,493
chan: is this your first time
on ember island?

226
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,928
azula: no, i used to
come here years ago.

227
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,731
it's a great place
if you like sand.

228
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,267
[laughing]

229
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:19,304
yeah, it's like,
"welcome to sandy land."

230
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,874
[both laugh]

231
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:27,813
your arms look so strong.

232
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,582
yeah, i know.

233
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,054
you're pretty.

234
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:37,823
[sweetly]: together,
you and i will be...

235
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,559
[firmly]: the strongest couple
in the entire world.

236
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,561
we will dominate the earth!

237
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:50,369
uh... i gotta go.

238
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,648
hey, watch it.

239
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,883
that food was for
my cranky girlfriend.

240
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,023
whoa...

241
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:13,859
what are you doing?

242
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,894
stop talking to my girlfriend.

243
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,263
relax, it's just a party.

244
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,431
uh!

245
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,535
zuko, what is wrong
with you?

246
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,170
what's wrong with me?

247
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,905
your temper's
out of control.

248
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,874
you blow up over
every little thing.

249
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,810
you're so impatient and
hot-headed and angry.

250
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,747
well, at least
i feel something...
as opposed to you.

251
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,348
you have no passion
for anything.

252
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,151
you're just a big blah.

253
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:41,453
it's over, zuko.

254
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,222
we're done.

255
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,858
who broke my nana's vase?

256
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,827
that's it,
you're out of here.

257
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,462
i was just leaving.

258
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,332
have fun by yourself,
loser boy.

259
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,200
nice.

260
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,676
[waves gently roll]

261
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:15,921

[metallic clanking]

266
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,854
guys, you're all gonna
think i'm crazy

267
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,489
but it feels like
a metal man is coming.

268
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,493
[groans]

269

[appa roars]

273
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,637
azula: i thought
i'd find you here.

274
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:15,974
those summers we spent
here seem so long ago.

275
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,477
so much has changed.

276
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:19,912
come down to the
beach with me.

277
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:23,215
come on,
this place is depressing.

278
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,994
hey...

279
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:38,230
where's your new boyfriend?

280
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,635
are you cold?

281
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:46,372
i'm freezing.

282
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,007
i'll make a fire.

283
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:51,710
zuko: there's plenty of
stuff to burn in there.

284
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:52,811
[growls]

285
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,082
this is crazy.

286
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,852
how can we beat a guy who blows
things up with his mind?

287
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:00,753
we can.

288
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,154
jump on appa.

289
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,589
i'll try to distract him.

290
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:21,206

[appa growls]

294
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:22,434
[sigh]: i'm ok.

295
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,535
well, that was random.

296
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,170
i don't think so.

297
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,040
i get the feeling
he knows who we are.

298
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:31,110
[fire crackling]

299
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,047
ty lee: what are you doing?

300
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,582
what does it look
like i'm doing.

301
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:39,518
but it's a painting
of your family.

302
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,619
you think i care?

303
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,021
i think you do.

304
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:45,891
you don't know me, so why don't
you just mind your own business?

305
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,760
ah, i know you.

306
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:49,795
no, you don't.

307
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,263
you're stuck in your
little ty lee world

308
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,499
where everything's
great all the time.

309
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,467
zuko, leave her alone.

310
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,036
[mocking]: i'm so pretty,
look at me.

311
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,971
i can walk on my hands, whoo!

312
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,676
circus freak.

313
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:05,678
[laughs]

314
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,546
yes, i'm a circus freak.

315
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,848
go ahead and laugh
all you want.

316
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,884
you wanna know why
i joined the circus?

317
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,318
here we go.

318
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,288
ty lee: do you have any idea
what my home life was like

319
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:17,623
growing up with six sisters

320
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:20,192
who look exactly like me?

321
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,661
it was like,
i didn't even have my own name.

322
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,296
i joined the circus because

323
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,765
i was scared of spending
the rest of my life

324
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,801
as part of a matched set.

325
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:30,436
at least, i'm different now.

326
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:33,305
circus freak is a compliment.

327
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:36,775
guess that explains why you
need 10 boyfriends, too.

328
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,577
i'm sorry, what?

329
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,346
attention issues?

330
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:42,281
you couldn't get enough
attention when you were a kid

331
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,950
so you're trying
to make up for it now.

332
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,986
well, what's your excuse, mai?

333
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:50,389
you were an only child
for 15 years.

334
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,990
but even with all that attention

335
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:55,260
your aura is this
dingy, pasty, gray...

336
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,763
i don't believe in auras.

337
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,965
yeah, you don't
believe in anything.

338
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:04,336
oh, well, i'm sorry
i can't be as high-strung
and crazy as the rest of you.

339
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:05,804
zuko: i'm sorry, too.

340
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:09,208
i wish you would be
high-strung and crazy for once

341
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,310
instead of keeping all your
feelings bottled up inside.

342
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,178
she just called your aura dingy.

343
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,246
are you gonna take that?

344
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,781
what do you want from me?

345
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:19,685
you want a teary confession
about how hard my childhood was?

346
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,120
well, it wasn't.

347
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:24,223
i was a rich only child
who got anything i wanted

348
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:26,592
as long as i behaved...

349
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,861
...and sat still

350
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:31,563
and didn't speak
unless spoken to.

351
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,466
my mother said i had
to keep out of trouble.

352
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,869
we had my dad's political
career to think about.

353
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,837
azula: well, that's it, then.

354
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:41,573
you had a controlling mother
who had certain expectations

355
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:43,676
and if you strayed from them
you were shut down.

356
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:45,978
that's why you're afraid
to care about anything

357
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,146
and why you can't
express yourself.

358
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,615
you want me to express myself?

359
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:50,983
leave me alone!

360
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,621
i like it when you
express yourself.

361
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:56,855
don't touch me.

362
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:59,024
i'm still mad at you.

363
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,461
my life hasn't been
that easy, either, mai.

364
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:05,230
whatever- that doesn't excuse
the way you've been acting.

365
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:06,899
ty lee: calm down, you guys.

366
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,501
this much negative energy
is bad for your skin.

367
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,070
you'll totally break out.

368
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:12,204
zuko: bad skin?

369
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:14,807
normal teenagers worry
about bad skin.

370
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:16,308
i don't have that luxury.

371
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:20,179
my father decided to teach me
a permanent lesson on my face.

372
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,047
sorry, zuko, i...

373
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:25,484
for so long, i thought
that if my dad accepted me,
i'd be happy.

374
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:26,685
i'm back home, now.

375
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
my dad talks to me.

376
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:30,155
huh, he even thinks i'm a hero.

377
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:31,623
everything should
be perfect, right?

378
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:34,159
i should be happy now,
but i'm not.

379
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,929
i'm angrier than ever
and i don't know why.

380
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,198
there's a simple question
you need to answer then.

381
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,733
who are you angry at?

382
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:43,435
no one,
i'm just angry.

383
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:46,238
yeah, who are you
angry at, zuko?

384
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:49,041
everyone... i don't know.

385
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:49,842
is it dad?

386
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:51,477
no, no.

387
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:52,845
your uncle?
me?

388
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:54,880
no, no... no, no.

389
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,048
then who?

390
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,082
who are you angry at?

391
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,650
answer the question, zuko.

392
00:21:58,752 --> 00:21:59,685
ty lee: talk to us.

393
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:01,086
mai: come on,
answer the question.

394
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,688
azula: come on, answer it.

395
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:05,591
zuko: i'm angry at myself.

396
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:11,397
azula: why?

397
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,932
because i'm confused.

398
00:22:14,034 --> 00:22:15,868
because i'm not sure
i know the difference

399
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:17,736
between right
and wrong anymore.

400
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:18,637
you're pathetic.

401
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:22,074
mai: i know one thing
i care about...

402
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,109
i care about you.

403
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:27,713
[lone hand clap]

404
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:30,883
well, those were wonderful
performances, everyone.

405
00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:33,952
i guess you wouldn't
understand, would you, azula

406
00:22:34,054 --> 00:22:35,921
<i>because you're
just so perfect.</i>

407
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,023
well, yes, i guess you're right.

408
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:40,325
i don't have sob stories
like all of you.

409
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:43,462
i could sit here
and complain how our mom
liked zuko more than me

410
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:46,231
but i don't really care.

411
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:47,866
my own mother...

412
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,035
thought i was a monster.

413
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:56,775
she was right, of course,
but it still hurt.

414
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,144
ty lee: what lo and li
said came true.

415
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:01,246
the beach did help us
learn about ourselves.

416
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:03,582
i feel all smoothed.

417
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,217
i'll always remember this.

418
00:23:05,318 --> 00:23:08,887
you know what would make
this trip really memorable?

419
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:15,027
we've got some bad news, chan.

420
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:16,628
party's over.

421
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:19,598
[screaming]

422
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,100
[grunts]

423
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:31,777
