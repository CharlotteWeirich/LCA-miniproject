1
00:00:00,693 --> 00:00:03,693
<b>1x13 - Homecoming</b>

2
00:00:05,694 --> 00:00:07,798
<i>Previously on Green Lantern...</i>

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,998
Atrocitus used those planet killers
to tear a hole right through the Maelstrom.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,835
Big enough for his whole
spite armada to roll into Oan space.

5
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:20,506
I'm sorry, Hal. I'm now a soldier for
the righteous crusade of Atrocitus.

6
00:00:32,853 --> 00:00:35,521
So that's it.
That's your plan.

7
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:39,725
Fine. I just got one question.
Are you nuts!?

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,361
Ok. This harebrained scheme
makes my other schemes seem

9
00:00:42,396 --> 00:00:45,698
well-thought-out and practical.
But what else can we do?

10
00:00:45,732 --> 00:00:48,634
Nothing. Thanks to us,
the Red Lantern fleet

11
00:00:48,635 --> 00:00:51,537
will have no trouble
pouring into Guardian space.

12
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:54,907
And we're stuck here while
Atrocitus flies the Interceptor to Oa

13
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:57,043
and exterminates the Guardians.

14
00:00:57,077 --> 00:00:59,979
My plan won't help us
beat them to Oa, but maybe,

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,882
just maybe, we can get to the
same galactic neighborhood.

16
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,850
Let's move out.

17
00:01:07,554 --> 00:01:09,055
Kilowog.

18
00:01:10,757 --> 00:01:14,660
No. Even you can't beat
an entire armada.

19
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:16,062
I can slow them down,

20
00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:18,664
maybe buy a little time
for that plan of yours.

21
00:01:18,698 --> 00:01:20,599
You'll need every minute.

22
00:01:21,535 --> 00:01:23,502
You got this, sergeant.

23
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:37,583
Godspeed, Hal.

24
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:44,657
Coordinates achieved.
Dropping out of ultra warp.

25
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:56,235
Oa. At last. Now, the day
of vengeance has arrived.

26
00:01:57,404 --> 00:01:59,705
Incoming message from the surface.

27
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:02,875
Unidentified vessel,
you have breached Oan space.

28
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,144
Identify yourself immediately.

29
00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:08,514
We are discovered. Initiate attack
before they send Green Lanterns!

30
00:02:08,548 --> 00:02:12,918
Belay that order.
Drusa, your puppet.

31
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:16,989
I repeat, identify or face...

32
00:02:17,023 --> 00:02:21,460
<i>This is Green Lantern craft Interceptor
requesting emergency landing.</i>

33
00:02:21,495 --> 00:02:23,696
<i>Hal Jordan and Kilowog
have been wounded</i>

34
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,698
<i>and require immediate
medical attention.</i>

35
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:29,201
<i>I also have vital information
regarding the Red Lanterns.</i>

36
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:33,005
Understood, Interceptor,
and welcome home.

37
00:02:44,384 --> 00:02:49,488
What's going on here?
Where am I?

38
00:02:49,523 --> 00:02:53,792
I... I know her.
It's her. It's...

39
00:02:53,827 --> 00:02:56,996
- Carol. Carol!
- Hal?

40
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,267
Hal!
It is you!

41
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:04,570
Hal, what are you doing here?

42
00:03:04,604 --> 00:03:08,574
I...
I promised to take you to diner.

43
00:03:16,383 --> 00:03:19,952
In brightest day, in blackest night,

44
00:03:19,986 --> 00:03:22,655
no evil shall escape my sight.

45
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:25,291
Let those who worship evil's might

46
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:29,895
beware my power, Green Lantern's light.

47
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:42,541
Salaak, bear the injured
to the medical dome immediately.

48
00:03:42,576 --> 00:03:46,812
Yes, yes, as soon as I've received this
vital intelligence the A.I. spoke of.

49
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:49,148
Then, prep the ship to rendezvous
with our corps in sector...

50
00:03:49,182 --> 00:03:54,220
- Hello, Guardians.
- Atrocitus!

51
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:01,727
Fall back. Fall back!

52
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:28,354
How is this possible?
What are we to do?

53
00:04:28,388 --> 00:04:32,191
For the moment, nothing, Guardian.
We are in the most fortified spot on Oa,

54
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:35,327
and even with the corps deployed,
we are not without defenses.

55
00:04:38,765 --> 00:04:41,400
Blast them!

56
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:49,588
This, perhaps, is not
unlike what the people

57
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:55,014
of the forgotten zone experienced
at the hands of our Manhunters.

58
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:57,049
It's hard to believe
it all actually happened.

59
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,718
It was like a dream or something.

60
00:04:59,753 --> 00:05:01,754
One minute, I'm in my office,
and then, bam!

61
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:03,856
I'm on another planet fighting you.

62
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,559
What?
You look gorgeous, by the way.

63
00:05:07,594 --> 00:05:09,928
Hal, are you all right?

64
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:12,531
Of course. I'm with you.
Refill?

65
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:15,567
No, thanks. It's just that
you seem a little...

66
00:05:15,602 --> 00:05:20,406
Look, Carol, all I know is I was
far from you and needed to find you.

67
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,809
And now, we're together.
Everything's going to be ok.

68
00:05:23,843 --> 00:05:28,981
But what happened out there?
Frontier space, the Red armada.

69
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:30,282
What?

70
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:32,284
The Red Lantern army.
Were they stopped?

71
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,621
What about your friends out there,
the other Green Lanterns?

72
00:05:35,655 --> 00:05:37,956
What's a Green Lantern?

73
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:49,428
Ok, Reds.
It may be just a matter of time,

74
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:52,064
but I'm not making this easy on you.

75
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:14,887
- Where is it?
- Carol, what's wrong with you?

76
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:16,455
Why are we back at the base?

77
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,357
You didn't even look
at the dessert menu.

78
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:20,926
It's got to be here somewhere.

79
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:23,929
- What's got to be here?
- Your power battery.

80
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:26,165
You once told me...
well, Green Lantern told me...

81
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,969
That your power ring has to be recharged
by a battery that he keeps close by.

82
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:34,540
- Green Lantern told you?
- Yes, you as Green Lantern.

83
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:37,610
Anyway, since you spend more time
at Ferris air than anywhere else,

84
00:06:37,644 --> 00:06:40,212
it must be... here.

85
00:06:41,982 --> 00:06:45,117
What is it?
Where did it come from?

86
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:47,753
I believe it came in a gift set
with this.

87
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:50,189
I think they know each other.

88
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:52,791
- What are you doing?
- Maybe nothing,

89
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:54,593
but whenever I have trouble
with my desktop,

90
00:06:54,628 --> 00:06:56,729
the I.T. guys reboot the system.

91
00:06:56,763 --> 00:06:59,732
I'm hoping this will reboot
your system.

92
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:02,568
Hal, try to remember.

93
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:06,472
Will yourself to remember.

94
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:11,744
<i>In brightest day, in blackest night,</i>

95
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:14,647
<i>no evil shall escape my sight.</i>

96
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:17,082
<i>let those who worship evil's might</i>

97
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:21,887
<i>beware my power, Green Lantern's light!</i>

98
00:07:21,922 --> 00:07:24,924
<i>I remember.
Had to do the impossible.</i>

99
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,592
<i>Get to Oa before Atrocitus.</i>

100
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:28,360
<i>I could only think of one way.</i>

101
00:07:28,395 --> 00:07:32,965
<i>Zamaron. Now I see why you
wanted me along as your bodyguard.</i>

102
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:37,069
Easy, quick draw.
We're not here to fight.

103
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:38,604
We're here to beg.

104
00:07:40,574 --> 00:07:43,909
Great Aga'po,
I know you think I'm your enemy,

105
00:07:43,944 --> 00:07:45,744
but there's a galaxy-wide
tragedy brewing,

106
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:48,914
and only the power of the
Star Sapphires can help stop it.

107
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:52,618
You risk much, Green Lantern,
asking favors of an enemy.

108
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:56,288
But perhaps I should first
consult my royal advisor.

109
00:07:57,857 --> 00:07:59,391
Ghia'ta.

110
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:00,993
It was you who opened my eyes

111
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:03,228
to the true meaning of love,
Hal Jordan.

112
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:05,831
My enlightenment met
with resistance, at first.

113
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:08,834
But then, the truth took
root and spread quickly.

114
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:10,603
It seems that over the ages,

115
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:14,640
the Star Sapphires may have lost
sight of the emotion we serve.

116
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:18,410
Since you helped us regain our
path, what do you ask of us?

117
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:21,413
I need you to teleport me
my home planet.

118
00:08:21,448 --> 00:08:24,717
What you ask for cannot be done.

119
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:28,220
But I saw you teleport Carol
Ferris here all the way from Earth.

120
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:30,990
So use my feelings for Carol
to send me to Earth.

121
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:34,226
From there, I can fly to Oa and
stop a tragedy before it happens.

122
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,563
The jaunt from Earth was the
longest we've ever attempted,

123
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:39,999
and we've never sent
anyone the other way.

124
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:42,101
There is something more.

125
00:08:42,135 --> 00:08:45,571
The spatial displacement
can render the traveler...

126
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:49,274
- ...unstable.
- It is too dangerous.

127
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:52,811
If he doesn't reach Oa, not only
will the Guardians be destroyed,

128
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:56,582
but Atrocitus will lay waste
to all the worlds in their care.

129
00:08:56,616 --> 00:09:00,586
Love and everything else will
cease to exist in Guardian space.

130
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,123
I've got to try.
Please.

131
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,597
Make sure this galaxy remains a
safe garden where love can bloom.

132
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,178
- Carol...
- I know.

133
00:09:30,248 --> 00:09:33,552
The galaxy's in danger, and
you stopped for a 4-course meal.

134
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:35,454
Go already.

135
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:41,627
But you're still on
the hook for dessert.

136
00:10:08,722 --> 00:10:11,223
Well, if it's my time to clock out,

137
00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:14,460
at least I know
I went down swinging.

138
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:18,630
Whoa.

139
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:01,807
Who are you supposed to be?

140
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:05,978
I am merely the conduit of the
great hope that surrounds us all.

141
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:07,579
I am St. Walker,

142
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:11,116
and I believe I am the first
Blue Lantern in the universe.

143
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:12,885
Thanks for the power boost.

144
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,821
But one extra soldier ain't
exactly going to turn the tide.

145
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:18,891
I agree.
That's why I brought a friend.

146
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:28,133
<i>I am honored to help
Green Lantern Kilowog.</i>

147
00:11:29,502 --> 00:11:32,771
Now, that's more like it.

148
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:36,508
You're leaving us, Razer?

149
00:11:36,543 --> 00:11:39,711
I won't lounge here in
luxury while evil triumphs.

150
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:42,080
Then go
in the spirit of love.

151
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:44,550
Love will doubtless be
foremost in my mind

152
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:48,420
as I hurl myself into the path
of an unstoppable armada.

153
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:52,090
You are not as far gone
as we had assumed, Razer.

154
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,993
There is still love in your heart.

155
00:11:55,028 --> 00:12:00,933
If you truly wish to help Hal Jordan,
there is another way.

156
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:09,208
You go, Mogo!

157
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:12,611
You know, considering
my backup is a couple of rookies,

158
00:12:12,645 --> 00:12:14,613
I'm starting to feel lucky.

159
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:18,317
Don't put your trust in luck,
friend. She is fickle.

160
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:24,957
Shoot it, Mogo. Now!

161
00:12:45,178 --> 00:12:47,512
- What are they?
- Liberators.

162
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:49,982
Planet killers.

163
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:53,518
Our triumph is at hand.

164
00:12:53,553 --> 00:12:57,055
Only a few feet of Raconian
stands between me

165
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:01,460
and the vengeance
I have awaited for centuries.

166
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:44,803
Any final words, Green Lantern?

167
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:48,907
Yes.
Open dome.

168
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:05,610
Welcome Green Lantern.
You've arrived just in time to watch

169
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:10,250
the Guardians pay for their
crimes against the forgotten zone.

170
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:18,258
Well, as much as I've been looking
forward to the winner-take-all,

171
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:21,327
no-holds-barred cage match,
I've got something to say...

172
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:24,330
Something I never thought
I'd hear coming out of my mouth.

173
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:26,466
You're right.

174
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:30,970
What the Manhunters did
to your sector was a tragedy.

175
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:32,872
Your rage is earned.

176
00:14:32,907 --> 00:14:36,276
But destroying life here isn't
going to change what happened there.

177
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,611
Let's work together to find a solution,

178
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:41,681
a way to make things better for
the people of the forgotten zone.

179
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:43,249
Let us help.

180
00:14:43,284 --> 00:14:46,052
You can help, Earth man.

181
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:53,693
Your dying screams will help
soothe the restless souls of our dead!

182
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:04,571
If you are going to destroy me,
there is a more expedient method.

183
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:06,773
Destroy you?
I wouldn't dream of it.

184
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:09,209
I'm just deleting
all of your higher functions

185
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:12,612
so you'll behave like
a proper NAV computer.

186
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:14,714
Say good-bye, my puppet.

187
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:29,429
Razer.
H... how...

188
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:33,066
It does not matter.

189
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:43,610
We must find Hal Jordan.

190
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:57,090
Hey, moon face, that blue ring
of yours is boosting me,

191
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,758
so why ain't it boosting Mogo?

192
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:00,760
I think I have to be
within a certain proximity

193
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:03,329
to a green power ring
to amplify its power.

194
00:16:03,364 --> 00:16:07,834
Mogo's is inconveniently located
miles below the surface.

195
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:13,373
I got an idea.
Let's hope this works.

196
00:17:11,432 --> 00:17:14,801
Well, what do you know!

197
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:22,809
I've been looking forward to this
for quite some time!

198
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,524
You are no match for me.

199
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:51,905
You never... had...
a chance!

200
00:17:56,877 --> 00:18:00,413
He cannot fight on.
He has not the strength.

201
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,815
He may not have the strength...

202
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:07,186
but does he have the will?

203
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:55,902
Guards! Retreat!

204
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:58,771
Wait!
Zox, soldiers, all of you!

205
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:02,141
Listen. Stop this
war before it begins.

206
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:03,810
I was telling the truth.

207
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:07,146
The Green Lanterns will help
rebuild your shattered sector.

208
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,924
Do you seriously expect us to
believe that anything will change?

209
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,461
Who here would ever
come to the forgotten zone?

210
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,063
I will come.

211
00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:27,133
What happened to your sector
was a tragedy,

212
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:32,772
but our willingness to ignore the
tragedy we caused... was a crime.

213
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:40,146
I pledge to you
the Guardians will make restitution.

214
00:19:56,697 --> 00:20:02,502
You will find me a loud and grating
voice of justice for my sector, Guardian.

215
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:07,673
Whatever reparations you think
are enough, start by doubling them.

216
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:11,511
Meet the new boss,
same as the old boss. More or less.

217
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,180
Can the Guardians trust Zilius Zox?

218
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:18,151
They can trust him to do whatever's in
his best interest, and that's a start.

219
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:21,754
Razer, how in the world did
you get to Oa as fast as I did?

220
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:22,989
I...

221
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:25,825
2814, you have not
yet been debriefed.

222
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:29,896
That is, we Guardians
have not yet had a chance to...

223
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:33,733
to thank you, Hal Jordan.

224
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:35,568
You just did.

225
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:39,839
But I've got to get back to Earth.

226
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:43,009
You have just
averted an intergalactic war.

227
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:46,546
What on Earth could
possibly be more important than that?

228
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,558
Dessert.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
