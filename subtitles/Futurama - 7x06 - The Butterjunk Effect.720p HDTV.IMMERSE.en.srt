3
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:23,639
Well, what'll it be, folks?

4
00:00:23,764 --> 00:00:25,075
Tap water or bottled?

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,342
Whatever.

6
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:27,819
Kif, you pick.

7
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:30,580
Oh, oh, it's always
so hard to decide.

8
00:00:30,705 --> 00:00:32,866
Um, uh, tap.
I mean bottled.

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,885
Bam!

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,022
Ooh, I love your boots, Leela.

11
00:00:39,147 --> 00:00:41,375
Nobody would ever guess
they're knockoffs.

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,543
How could you tell?
I guessed.

13
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:45,837
They're at it again.

14
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:47,097
Please, Fry.

15
00:00:47,222 --> 00:00:49,341
Girlfriends always
talk trash to each other.

16
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,234
Like how I might say
I like Amy's dress

17
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,936
'cause it covers
all her tramp stamps.

18
00:00:54,762 --> 00:00:56,005
Knock it off, Fry.

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,941
It's when women are
polite to each other

20
00:00:58,066 --> 00:00:59,518
that you know there's a problem.

21
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,211
Exactly.

22
00:01:01,336 --> 00:01:04,022
Now, enough about who is
and who isn't a Chinese skank.

23
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:07,117
We're just two happy couples
on a double date.

24
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,927
Let's go! Let's go!

25
00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:19,462
We've got to get these moon rocks

26
00:01:19,587 --> 00:01:21,581
to the moon by moondown.

27
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:23,733
Why are we bringing moon rocks
to the moon?

28
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,937
Oh, those lunar crybabies
claim the rocks

29
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:30,424
were stolen by the Apollo astronauts.

30
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,552
They consider them part
of their cultural heritage.

31
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:37,713
Nice work, Leela.

32
00:01:37,838 --> 00:01:39,433
You're really pulling your weight.

33
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,809
Which is saying something.

34
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,396
Ow!

35
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,447
You're using the rocks
to build a wall?

36
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,398
What about your cultural heritage?

37
00:01:55,523 --> 00:01:57,834
You bought that cultural
heritage hoo-ha?

38
00:01:59,294 --> 00:02:01,413
What a bunch of big-city dummies.

39
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,839
At least the rocks are light here.

40
00:02:02,964 --> 00:02:04,107
I don't even need my

41
00:02:04,232 --> 00:02:05,834
over-the-shoulder Boulder holder.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,443
With one-sixth gravity, you can work

43
00:02:07,568 --> 00:02:09,012
and be lazy at the same time.

44
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:11,006
It's like being a voice actor.

45
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,516
Say, you nose-breathers
want to come see

46
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:15,351
some real moon culture,

47
00:02:15,476 --> 00:02:18,096
come on down to the
butterfly derby tonight.

48
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:20,023
Wait, the butterfly derby is when?

49
00:02:20,148 --> 00:02:21,641
And what?

50
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,337
The low gravity lets them nice ladies

51
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:35,781
flap every which way,

52
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:39,868
so long as they only wear light,
skimpy outfits.

53
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,329
It's a necessity of the sport, it is.

54
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,813
This is actually quite elegant.

55
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:45,381
It's not what I was expecting.

56
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:48,418
Ladies and gentlemen,

57
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:50,019
please welcome the meanest things

58
00:02:50,144 --> 00:02:51,296
on gossamer wings...

59
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,010
The Murderflies!

60
00:02:57,885 --> 00:02:59,528
This is what I was expecting.

61
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:02,031
So, uh, what are the rules
of this sport?

62
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:03,809
You see that there?

63
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,301
That's called a floor.

64
00:03:05,426 --> 00:03:08,230
Once a butterfly hits that,
she's out.

65
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,039
Last team flying wins.

66
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:12,859
Super swatter!

67
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,758
Keep your eye on the ground.

68
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:30,894
That's where she's going to land.

69
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,797
Yep, called it.

70
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:38,760
And now, for our weekly
amateur flapdown.

71
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:40,169
Do we have two volunteers

72
00:03:40,294 --> 00:03:42,071
to go wing-to-wing
with the Murderflies?

73
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:43,907
Winners get 50 bucks
and the accolades

74
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:45,767
of dozens of hooting hillbillies.

75
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:49,879
What do you think, Leela?

76
00:03:50,004 --> 00:03:51,347
Judging from your tank top,

77
00:03:51,472 --> 00:03:53,692
you love getting hooted at
by hillbillies.

78
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,584
And you could use the $50

79
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,686
for another gallon
of hello kitty perfume.

80
00:03:57,811 --> 00:03:59,422
The bicker sisters teaming up?

81
00:03:59,547 --> 00:04:02,225
Talk about
cat women on the moon.

82
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:05,861
Okay, enough of that already.

83
00:04:05,986 --> 00:04:07,956
We're not really fighting.

84
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,125
Then prove it... by fighting.

85
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,767
All right, we will.

86
00:04:11,892 --> 00:04:13,086
Come on, Amy.

87
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,238
Why don't you and I

88
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:17,299
ever do things together?

89
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,265
This is hard.

90
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:27,851
Now I know why butterflies
are always so grouchy.

91
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,386
Please welcome
tonight's volunteer victims:

92
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:33,440
Turanga Leela and Amy Wong!

93
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,525
Hang on.
We're not quite ready to...

94
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:42,490
You girls have moxie.

95
00:04:42,656 --> 00:04:44,159
We're going to beat it out of you.

96
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,745
Amy, remember when we tried
out for the rockettes?

97
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,471
And we failed because we accidentally

98
00:04:48,596 --> 00:04:50,081
kicked those two rockettes to death?

99
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:52,083
Yeah. Why do you bring that up?

100
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:53,919
Oh.

101
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:05,013
We'll teach you
not to lose immediately.

102
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,309
Announcer:
Super shocker!

103
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,556
Yay. They can move their arms.

104
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:44,684
Congratulations to our gutsy,
non-paralyzed challengers.

105
00:05:47,121 --> 00:05:48,297
Ladies, that is the kind

106
00:05:48,422 --> 00:05:49,999
of can-do performance
I like to see...

107
00:05:50,124 --> 00:05:52,394
From my new butterfly derby team.

108
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,370
Which is what
I am offering you to be.

109
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:56,906
Because I'm the commissioner
of the butterfly derby.

110
00:05:57,031 --> 00:05:58,207
I'm Abner Doubledeal.

111
00:05:58,332 --> 00:05:59,567
Hello.

112
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:00,843
But we lost.

113
00:06:00,968 --> 00:06:02,696
Why would you want us
to join your league?

114
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,913
We're always looking for fresh blood,

115
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:05,381
and you girls are full of it.

116
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:07,200
You two could be the next big thing.

117
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,910
What happened to the last big thing?

118
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:10,520
Nothing that doesn't happen
to everyone eventually.

119
00:06:10,645 --> 00:06:12,580
What is this, an inquisition?
You in or not?

120
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:13,989
Yes.

121
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:15,625
You spletcha.

122
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,227
<i>And so began the fight career</i>

123
00:06:18,352 --> 00:06:19,629
<i>of two skimpy outfits</i>

124
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:21,840
<i>and the feisty women who filled them.</i>

125
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,233
Ladies and gentlemen, the Wingnuts!

126
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:27,804
<i>And although sometimes
they got beaten,</i>

127
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,339
<i>other times, they got beaten badly.</i>

128
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,409
<i>But just when it looked</i>

129
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:34,894
<i>like they'd never win...</i>

130
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:36,938
<i>They didn't.</i>

131
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:39,182
Well, we lost to all our opponents.

132
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:41,951
Even that team that turned out
to be us in the mirror.

133
00:06:42,076 --> 00:06:43,528
It's time we gave up.

134
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,455
Yeah. I don't know what else

135
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,739
we could have done
to enhance our performance.

136
00:06:47,864 --> 00:06:49,966
Hey, great job tonight, you two.

137
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:51,953
Here, got you some fresh nectar.

138
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:56,932
Whoa, that puts
the lead in my pencil.

139
00:06:57,057 --> 00:06:59,359
Thanks, trainer.

140
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,050
Excuse me. What's that nectar
you're handing out?

141
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,375
It's a plant-based supplement

142
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,111
that bulks up your flapping muscles.

143
00:07:08,236 --> 00:07:09,545
Want to try it?

144
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,889
You know you want to.

145
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,615
A chemical that can help us win?

146
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,392
That sounds great.

147
00:07:14,558 --> 00:07:17,120
Mmm... I'm not sure.

148
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:19,731
Look, here's my disposable
cell phone number.

149
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,324
Think it over.
Give me a call when you're...

150
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:23,159
Hang on. I got to take this.

151
00:07:23,284 --> 00:07:24,160
Hello?

152
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:25,487
We're ready.
Great.

153
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,563
You are not going to regret this.

154
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:30,633
It's a nice, clean way
to improve your performance.

155
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:31,826
And we just drink it?

156
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:33,136
Or...

157
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:34,470
Inject it between your toes.

158
00:07:34,595 --> 00:07:36,829
Either way works, right?

159
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:39,609
Well... down the hatch.

160
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:42,111
Ah.
Ah.

161
00:07:42,236 --> 00:07:43,613
Mmm.

162
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:45,840
A guy
could get used to this.

163
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:49,731
{pub}Once again,

164
00:07:49,856 --> 00:07:53,473
Eternulax The Immortal,
dead at the age of 26.

165
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:57,526
Now here's Sportsbot 5000 to tell us

166
00:07:57,651 --> 00:08:00,562
about two local gals,
Amy Wong and Turanga Leela,

167
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:03,598
who have won 15
butterfly derby bouts in a row,

168
00:08:03,723 --> 00:08:06,068
even as rumors swirl
that they're juicing up

169
00:08:06,193 --> 00:08:08,037
with the controversial
nutritional supplement

170
00:08:08,162 --> 00:08:09,371
known as nectar.

171
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:10,782
Sportsbot?

172
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,826
That's pretty much it.

173
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,709
Riveting stuff, Sportsbot.

174
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:17,414
Yo, yo, yo.
What's up, ladies?

175
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,951
Uh-oh.
The bullies are back.

176
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:26,455
Leela, Amy, I like a
stalwart, feminine physique

177
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,343
as much as the next fellow,
but this nectar worries me.

178
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,261
You should be worried about this!

179
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,471
Boo-ya!

180
00:08:33,637 --> 00:08:35,130
Easy, Amy, easy.

181
00:08:35,255 --> 00:08:37,032
Professor, there's nothing
wrong with nectar.

182
00:08:37,157 --> 00:08:38,476
It's all-natural.

183
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:40,569
So are carrots, but you don't see me

184
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:43,429
injecting them between my toes.

185
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:52,948
Uh, Leela?

186
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:55,785
I was wondering if you'd like
to go out with me again.

187
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:58,663
Maybe play some miniature golf
or colossal tennis?

188
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,289
Sorry, Fry.

189
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,418
I already got a double
date with arm and hammer.

190
00:09:05,118 --> 00:09:06,895
Bender, you want to go
out and do something?

191
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,265
Oh, so now I'm your
last-resort Booty call, huh?

192
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,885
Okay, let's go.

193
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,738
That's my little sugar doodle.

194
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:34,032
Cork your face bladder.
I'm working!

195
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,290
Sorry.

196
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:36,525
I had that coming.

197
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,286
It's not easy being a derby wife.

198
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,372
The Wingnuts, ladies and gentlemen.

199
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:43,832
And that bloodbath takes them
to next week's finals

200
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:45,919
against our reigning champions,
the Murderflies.

201
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,132
Now, listen up.

202
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:53,718
I got a little boy
at home, and he's dying.

203
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,471
Dying to see me kill these two.

204
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,141
Oh, your son's going
to die all right...

205
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:01,726
But from neglect.

206
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:04,486
'Cause you're going home in an urn.

207
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:06,731
A funerary urn.

208
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,994
Hey, trainer, we got
a big bout next week.

209
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,463
Juice us up.

210
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:16,449
Sorry, gals. I'm all out.

211
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,800
These two just bought
my entire supply.

212
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:23,038
You're going...

213
00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:24,788
Down.

214
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,979
And she doesn't even
want to cuddle anymore.

215
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:33,415
She just wants to hit me
with various chairs.

216
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,849
You're lucky.

217
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:38,053
I can't even get Leela
to verbally abuse me.

218
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:39,889
All right, listen up.

219
00:10:40,055 --> 00:10:42,324
We're out of nectar,
and we need a new source.

220
00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:43,992
Uh, dearest, perhaps this would be

221
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:47,162
a good time to consider
possibly drinking

222
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:48,930
just a little less...

223
00:10:49,055 --> 00:10:51,985
Say, why don't you just
have Kif get you some nectar?

224
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,654
It comes from a flower
on his home planet.

225
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,838
You mean it's ocephalus nectar?

226
00:10:56,963 --> 00:10:58,740
Oh, my. Oh, dear.

227
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:00,775
It's found
in a rather remote region...

228
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,077
Just play along.

229
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:03,830
This could be our chance for romance.

230
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,380
Come on, ladies.

231
00:11:05,505 --> 00:11:07,182
Let's take a little trip
to Kif's planet.

232
00:11:07,307 --> 00:11:10,185
We'll gather some nectar, and
have a nice, romantic weekend.

233
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,753
Just the four of us.

234
00:11:11,878 --> 00:11:14,757
Let's go already!

235
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:36,904
Wow! It's the second most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

236
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,158
Hey Leela, want to know what
the <i>most</i> beautiful thing is?

237
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,910
No. Let's get hopped up.

238
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:46,921
Greetings eco-tourists!

239
00:11:47,046 --> 00:11:51,127
I am the grand butterfly
curator... this week.

240
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,762
Yeah, yeah, you can teach us
to respect nature later.

241
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:56,215
Right now, we've got
some flowers to suck dry.

242
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,467
Suck 'em, burn 'em... as long as
they're not butterflies,

243
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,886
I don't give a grand crap.

244
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,503
But take heed!

245
00:12:01,628 --> 00:12:04,766
For you see, it is mating season.

246
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,577
Whatever you do, you must not
disturb the aggressive male.

247
00:12:08,702 --> 00:12:11,346
He can be identified
by his orange coloration

248
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:13,608
and enormous butterjunk.

249
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,451
What's he gonna do,
migrate at us?

250
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:18,529
Silence!

251
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:20,689
I can't be specific about the danger,

252
00:12:20,814 --> 00:12:22,257
since if something different happens,

253
00:12:22,382 --> 00:12:23,958
I might be liable for damages.

254
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,787
But believe me,

255
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:30,875
you'll rue the day you came
to the butterfly preserve.

256
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,919
Well, enjoy the butterfly preserve.

257
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,002
Okay, bye.

258
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:35,296
Come on, come on.

259
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:36,638
Let's find those flowers.

260
00:12:36,763 --> 00:12:37,972
We'll split into teams.

261
00:12:38,097 --> 00:12:39,675
You mean couples?

262
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,803
Eh? Eh?

263
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,845
Nice job smacking Kif.

264
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,473
Dude had it coming. Wait.

265
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,684
I think I smell nectar.

266
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,851
Way ahead of you!

267
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,390
I don't even know
why we're helping find

268
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:58,159
an addictive drug for
our mean girlfriends.

269
00:12:58,284 --> 00:13:00,029
Quiet, they'll hear you.

270
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,966
The male butterfly.

271
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:06,167
It's gorgeous!

272
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:07,369
Let me get my butterfly hammer.

273
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:08,870
Bender, no.

274
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:11,906
That park ranger explicitly
gave us a vague warning.

275
00:13:12,031 --> 00:13:14,627
Look, the hammer's already out;
I got to smash something.

276
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:37,567
It smells like a skunk
stuffed with feta cheese.

277
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,534
P.U.!

278
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:41,779
Thank God I don't have a nose.

279
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,702
We can sleep at my parents' house.

280
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,579
I'll just buzz and let
them know we're here.

281
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:55,884
Mom, dad, I'm sure you remember

282
00:13:56,009 --> 00:14:00,339
Fry, Leela, Bender, and of
course my fon-fon-ru, Amy.

283
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:02,675
Welcome to our home.

284
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,343
One of you stinks.

285
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:05,427
That'd be me.

286
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:06,795
Wait, you're flies.

287
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,347
Don't you eat excrement?

288
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:11,058
That's a day at the beach
compared to this.

289
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:14,369
Listen, I'm just gonna shower
this stuff off and go to bed.

290
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:16,689
Wait.
Don't take a shower, Fry.

291
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,573
You smell kind of nice.

292
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,694
Uh, sm... yeah.
Huh?

293
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,478
No hanky-panky.

294
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:26,365
Everyone sleep in separate rooms.

295
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:28,075
Good night, Kif.

296
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:29,918
Night, Fry.
Huh?

297
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:35,156
Keep your door unlocked tonight.

298
00:14:35,281 --> 00:14:39,045
But McGruff the crime dog says... oh!

299
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:54,967
Come in.

300
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,739
Hey, smelly-pants.

301
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:07,823
Leela?!

302
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:08,783
Leela?!

303
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,618
Amy?!
Amy?!

304
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,527
I'm done polishing my ass, Fry.

305
00:15:12,652 --> 00:15:13,829
Here's your toothbrush back.

306
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,324
{pub}You just hop into bed
with my boyfriend?!

307
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:26,551
And you!

308
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,154
As God is my witness,
I'll never forgive you for this!

309
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:33,624
Hey, just 'cause he's your boyfriend

310
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:35,493
doesn't mean you get him
all to yourself.

311
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,398
He's mine! There's nothing
more to talk about.

312
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,816
No, no, keep talking.

313
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,360
Um, Amy, I hope I'm not
out of line, but...

314
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,603
Shut up, Kif.

315
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:48,906
How dare you talk
that way to my Kif?!

316
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,827
This planet's got it going on.

317
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:57,415
Sweet orgy of Georgia!

318
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,083
Have you girls gone wild?

319
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,793
That's Fry you're macking on.

320
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:07,325
Hmm. It seems Fry's
inexplicable sex appeal

321
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,803
is due to the butterfly
pheromone he was sprayed with.

322
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,630
But Amy and Leela aren't butterflies.

323
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:14,140
Right?

324
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,268
No, but thanks to
the damned butterfly nectar

325
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,645
they've been swilling,
they might as well be.

326
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:23,808
The nectar causes
their bodies to produce

327
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,843
female butterfly hormones,

328
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:27,778
building up their flapping muscles,

329
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,365
but also making them
irresistibly attracted to Fry.

330
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,519
The only way to end this madness

331
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:36,988
is for the ladies
to quit, cold Turkey.

332
00:16:37,113 --> 00:16:38,039
Whoa, whoa!

333
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,690
Let's not shock their system.

334
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:42,293
Maybe they could just go warm Turkey?

335
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,128
No, the Professor's right.

336
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,563
We have to quit the nectar.

337
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:46,831
I agree.

338
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:48,633
This has to stop.

339
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:55,640
My guts feel kind of weird.

340
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,042
I'm not surprised.

341
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:59,310
Those pheromones were
highly concentrated.

342
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:03,356
Oh, I think I'm getting
a little... caterpilly.

343
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:16,243
All right,
let's get this party ended.

344
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,718
We did it!

345
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:34,261
We kicked nectar's butt!

346
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:36,597
I don't give a crap!

347
00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:38,383
Kif, I'm sorry for

348
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:41,018
making out with Fry
so loud and often.

349
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,687
It's all right, dearest.

350
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,889
I know it was just
the nectar talking.

351
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:46,691
And groping.

352
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,860
Well, looks like Fry's three-way
is down to a one-way.

353
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,070
If he's lucky.

354
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,280
Hey, where is Fry?

355
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,974
Amy, Leela! What are you doing
at your place of work?

356
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:05,076
Your match with the Murderflies
is about to start.

357
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:13,050
Moon-ladies and moon-men,

358
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:15,052
presenting the defending champions,

359
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,922
the queens of hostility
from the sea of tranquility,

360
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:20,891
the Murderflies!

361
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,432
And now their opponents:
The vixens most horrible

362
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:30,484
from the big blue marble,
the Wingnuts.

363
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:34,321
Everybody kill everybody!

364
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,323
Well, we're not on the juice anymore,

365
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:38,159
but what's the worst that can happen?

366
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:40,478
Since this is a championship match,

367
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:42,830
we are gonna need some lava!

368
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,784
Wait. Hot lava?

369
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,656
Amy, if we get killed,
I just want to say

370
00:18:51,781 --> 00:18:53,883
it's been an honor riding the
roller coaster of addiction

371
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:56,719
and recovery with you, as a team.

372
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,858
How could this not be hurting you?

373
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,152
I once killed a sea turtle
with these boots.

374
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:17,448
Hold me.

375
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:44,209
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, no, no. Oh, no.

376
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:45,726
Make a wish.

377
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,588
My God!

378
00:19:56,713 --> 00:20:00,091
Fry has metamorphosed
into a gigantic butterfly!

379
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:03,035
He's even more beautiful than before!

380
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,825
Ooh, what is that sexy stink?

381
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,439
Oh, cripes!

382
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:16,006
They're mating!

383
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,843
Ladies and gentlemen,

384
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,746
I am so sorry for allowing
this lurid sex act

385
00:20:21,871 --> 00:20:25,474
to taint an otherwise delightful
day of family-friendly violence.

386
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:30,221
That is some freaky
bug-on-bug action.

387
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:32,398
I feel a little left out.

388
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,297
Is Fry going to be okay?

389
00:20:39,422 --> 00:20:40,898
I don't think so.

390
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:43,534
He's grown all these
strange insect parts,

391
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,079
and he has absolutely
no brain activity.

392
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:48,706
Look!

393
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,708
He lost the strange insect parts.

394
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,379
He's back to normal!

395
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,631
