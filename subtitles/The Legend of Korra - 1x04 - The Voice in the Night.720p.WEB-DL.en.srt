11
00:00:28,401 --> 00:00:30,431
<i>This masked madman
has the ability</i>

12
00:00:30,444 --> 00:00:32,238
<i>to take away a person's bending.</i>

It's...

21
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:34,819
It's alright, Naga.

22
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:37,365
I just had a bad dream.

23
00:01:40,674 --> 00:01:43,236
There is a madman
running around our beloved city,

24
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,262
threatening to tear it apart.

25
00:01:45,268 --> 00:01:46,974
We need to create taskforce

26
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,697
whose sole mission
is to find Amon

27
00:01:49,698 --> 00:01:51,503
and bring him to justice.

28
00:01:51,553 --> 00:01:52,861
Absolutely not!

29
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:56,598
A move so aggressive will only
further divide benders and non-benders.

30
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,112
Tarrlok, I'm inclined to agree
with your proposal,

31
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,065
but who would even head up
such a taskforce...

32
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,961
It would be my honor,

33
00:02:04,962 --> 00:02:07,889
and privilege
to accept such a duty.

34
00:02:07,982 --> 00:02:11,669
This is just another one of your ploys
to gain more power, isn't it?

35
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:13,569
All I'm trying to do is help!

36
00:02:13,743 --> 00:02:14,963
Think back...

37
00:02:15,194 --> 00:02:16,489
Forty two years ago,

38
00:02:16,526 --> 00:02:19,549
Republic City was threatened
by another dangerous man.

39
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:20,861
Yukon.

40
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:23,928
Your father wasn't afraid
to deal with him head on.

41
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:26,426
This is a completely different situation,

44
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:34,370
with the Bending Triads.

45
00:02:34,494 --> 00:02:36,975
Eventually, he will come
for all us, benders.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,539
Our friends, our families...

47
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,650
Vote for this taskforce,
and I will stop Amon...

48
00:02:42,838 --> 00:02:44,406
Before it's too late.

49
00:02:44,604 --> 00:02:45,918
All in favor?

50
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:07,877
<i>Good evening, my fellow Equalists.</i>

51
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,888
<i>This is your leader, Amon.</i>

52
00:03:10,934 --> 00:03:13,331
<i>As you have heard,
the Republic Council has voted</i>

53
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:16,050
<i>to make me
public enemy number one...</i>

54
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:17,477
<i>Proving once again</i>

55
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,395
<i>that the bending oppressors
of this city</i>

56
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:22,908
<i>will stop at nothing
to quash our revolution...</i>

57
00:03:23,544 --> 00:03:25,510
<i>But we cannot be stopped.</i>

<i>The time has come</i>

61
00:03:34,073 --> 00:03:37,054
<i>for benders
to experience fear.</i>

62
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:56,273
Oh no, I'm so sorry!
I didn't see you!

63
00:03:56,314 --> 00:03:58,233
How could you <i>not</i> see me?

64
00:03:58,358 --> 00:04:00,594
I mean I was ju-uh...

65
00:04:04,097 --> 00:04:05,988
I was... I, I...

66
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:08,093
Wow! Hm-hm.
I was... Hm-hmm.

67
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:10,036
Are you okay?
Did I hurt you?

68
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:11,840
Oh, I'm such an idiot!

69
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:13,715
Don't worry, I'm fine!

70
00:04:13,746 --> 00:04:16,643
My brother hits me harder than that,
every day in practice.

71
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:19,212
Wait, I recognize you.

72
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:20,950
You're Mako, right?

73
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:22,957
You play for the Fire Ferrets!

74
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:24,828
Yeah, that's me.

75
00:04:25,143 --> 00:04:27,341
I am so embarrassed...

76
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,242
My name's Asami.
Let me make this up to you somehow.

77
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,951
Uh...

78
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:34,518
How about I treat you to dinner?

79
00:04:34,593 --> 00:04:37,205
Tomorrow night, eight o'clock,
Quong's Cuisine?

80
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,456
Erm... "Quong's"?

81
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:42,736
I don't have any clothes nice enough
for a place that classy.

82
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:44,367
I'll take care of that.

83
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:46,296
All you need is show up.

84
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:48,735
So... it's a date?

85
00:04:48,741 --> 00:04:51,269
Ahh... Yeah, I guess so!

86
00:04:51,732 --> 00:04:53,614
I'll see you tomorrow night!

87
00:05:06,954 --> 00:05:09,041
We are grateful
for this delicious food,

88
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:11,598
for our happiness,
for our compassion and…

89
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:14,027
I'm not interrupting...
Am I?

90
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:18,019
This is my home, Tarrlok!

91
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:19,319
We're about to eat dinner.

92
00:05:19,394 --> 00:05:22,768
Good, because I'm absolutely famished.

93
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:26,906
Airbenders never turn away
a hungry guest, am I right?

94
00:05:27,584 --> 00:05:28,980
I suppose...

95
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,823
You must be
the famous Avatar Korra.

96
00:05:37,184 --> 00:05:39,465
It is truly an honor.

97
00:05:39,677 --> 00:05:41,353
I am councilman Tarrlok,

98
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:43,474
representative
from the Northern Water tribe.

99
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:44,717
Nice to meet you.

100
00:05:47,404 --> 00:05:49,120
Why do you have three ponytails?

101
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:51,549
And how come you smell like a lady?
You're weird.

102
00:05:51,587 --> 00:05:53,155
Well, aren't you…

103
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:54,864
Precocious.

104
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:59,410
So, I've been reading all about
your adventures in the papers.

105
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,301
Infiltrating Amon's rally...

106
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:03,707
Now that took
some real initiative.

107
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:05,577
Aw, thanks.

108
00:06:05,877 --> 00:06:09,375
I think you are first authority figure
in this city who's happy I'm here.

109
00:06:09,394 --> 00:06:12,939
Republic City is much better off now,
that you've arrived.

110
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:15,194
Enough with the flattery, Tarrlok.

111
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:16,994
What do you want from Korra?

112
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:19,604
Patience, Tenzin.
I'm getting to that.

113
00:06:20,864 --> 00:06:24,034
As you may have heard,
I am assembling a taskforce

114
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,470
that will strike
at the heart of the revolution

115
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:28,203
and I want you to join me.

116
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:29,766
- Really?
- What?

117
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:33,022
I need someone who will help me
attack Amon directly.

118
00:06:33,053 --> 00:06:35,534
Someone who is fearless
in the face of danger.

119
00:06:35,572 --> 00:06:38,531
And that someone is you.

120
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:40,435
Join your taskforce?

121
00:06:41,581 --> 00:06:42,849
I can't…

122
00:06:49,801 --> 00:06:53,256
I must admit,
I'm rather surprised.

123
00:06:53,354 --> 00:06:57,043
I thought you'd jump at the chance
to help me lead the charge against Amon.

124
00:06:57,062 --> 00:06:58,308
Me too...

125
00:06:58,382 --> 00:07:00,093
I came to Republic City.

126
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:02,526
to finish my Avatar
training with Tenzin.

127
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:04,845
Right now,
I just need to focus on that.

128
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:07,816
Which is why
this opportunity is perfect!

129
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:09,749
You will get 'on the job' experience,

130
00:07:09,768 --> 00:07:12,768
while performing your
Avatar duty for the City.

131
00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:14,496
Korra gave you her answer,

132
00:07:14,515 --> 00:07:16,214
it's time for you to go.

133
00:07:16,777 --> 00:07:18,979
Very well, but...

134
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:21,422
I'm not giving up on you
just yet!

135
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:23,333
You'll be hearing from me soon.

136
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:26,447
It has been a pleasure,
Avatar Korra.

137
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,390
Bye-bye, ponytail man!

138
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:41,998
Aah, welcome to Quong's Cuisine,
master Mako.

139
00:07:42,027 --> 00:07:43,617
Uh… "master"?

140
00:07:57,134 --> 00:07:59,293
The scarf stays.

141
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:03,458
As you wish, Sir.
This way, please.

142
00:08:07,664 --> 00:08:10,237
I am such a big pro-bending fan.

143
00:08:10,306 --> 00:08:12,333
I caught all of your matches
this season.

144
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:14,163
All of them? Wow!

145
00:08:14,557 --> 00:08:17,203
Honestly, there are few
I wish you hadn't seen.

146
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:20,074
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
You're amazing.

147
00:08:20,143 --> 00:08:22,055
I can't wait to see you
play in the tournament.

148
00:08:22,074 --> 00:08:24,636
Yeah, well.
Uh... maybe next year.

149
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,974
What do you mean?
You made it in.

150
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:29,584
It just isn't in the cards for us,
right now.

151
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:33,044
Tell me, what's the problem?

152
00:08:34,156 --> 00:08:37,320
We don't have the cash to ante up
for the Championship pot.

153
00:08:37,714 --> 00:08:40,861
So, it looks like
we're out of the running.

154
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:42,308
That's not fair!

155
00:08:43,246 --> 00:08:46,229
Pardon me, Miss Sato,
your main course.

156
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,204
"Miss Sato"?

157
00:08:49,298 --> 00:08:52,333
You wouldn't happen to be related
to Hitoshi Sato,

158
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:53,844
creator of the Satomobile?

159
00:08:53,845 --> 00:08:56,179
- Yeah, he's my dad.
- Get out of town!

160
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:58,973
I'm serious.
You wanna meet him?

161
00:08:59,618 --> 00:09:03,313
Meet the most successful captain of industry
in all of Republic City?

162
00:09:03,638 --> 00:09:05,477
Yeah, I'll take you up on that!

163
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:10,683
Hello, fellow teammate!

164
00:09:10,814 --> 00:09:12,171
Hey, Bolin.

165
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:14,078
Missed you at practice, this week.

166
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:15,809
Yeah, sorry about that.

167
00:09:16,227 --> 00:09:19,081
That's alright,
we're probably out of tournament, anyway.

168
00:09:19,118 --> 00:09:22,228
Unless some money miraculously
drops out of the sky by tomorrow.

169
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:25,360
Anyway, reason I came by
was to give you this.

170
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:26,561
Ta-da!

171
00:09:26,574 --> 00:09:29,036
Wow, thanks.
What's this for?

172
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:32,037
Uh… Oh, I can't remember now.
Aw, yeah. Now I remember!

173
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:33,973
You saved me from Amon...

174
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:36,351
Oh, that? It was no big deal.

175
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:37,812
"No big deal?"
Are you serious?

176
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:41,171
I was totally freaking out when he was
coming at me with this creepy mask, all...

177
00:09:41,184 --> 00:09:43,977
"I will take away your bending
forever!"

178
00:09:43,996 --> 00:09:47,416
I mean, that is scary stuff,
I still can't sleep well!

179
00:09:47,894 --> 00:09:50,767
- M-hmm.
- Delivery, for Avatar Korra.

180
00:09:52,604 --> 00:09:56,337
Tarrlok sends his complements
and urges you to reconsider his offer.

181
00:09:56,356 --> 00:09:58,911
Tell him I haven't changed my mind.

182
00:09:58,936 --> 00:10:00,217
M-hmm...

183
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,723
Who's this Tarrlok guy?

184
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:05,941
Is he bothering you? Huh?
Because I can have a word with him.

185
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,397
Ha! No...
It's not like that.

186
00:10:08,628 --> 00:10:11,892
He's just some old guy
who works with Tenzin on the Council.

187
00:10:11,984 --> 00:10:14,644
Oh, good.
Good, that sounds better.

188
00:10:14,672 --> 00:10:15,954
I like that better.

189
00:10:22,294 --> 00:10:24,334
What do you think
of my little operation here?

190
00:10:24,464 --> 00:10:27,288
It's... very impressive, Mister Sato.

191
00:10:27,356 --> 00:10:29,060
Please, call me Hiroshi.

192
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:31,151
So, I understand you're dirt poor.

193
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:32,508
Wh... uh...

194
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:35,064
Young man, it is nothing
to be ashamed of.

195
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:37,740
I too came from humble beginnings.

196
00:10:37,772 --> 00:10:39,730
Why, when I was your age,

197
00:10:39,731 --> 00:10:41,843
I was a mere shoe shiner,

198
00:10:41,844 --> 00:10:44,345
and all I had to my name
was an idea.

199
00:10:44,539 --> 00:10:46,459
The Satomobile.

200
00:10:47,906 --> 00:10:49,891
I was fortunate enough
to meet someone

201
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,464
who believed in me
and my work ethic.

202
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:56,521
He gave me the money I needed
to get my idea off the ground.

203
00:10:56,602 --> 00:10:59,927
And I built the entire
<i>Future Industries</i> empire

204
00:10:59,945 --> 00:11:02,807
from that one selfless loan.

205
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:06,154
Dad, stop bragging.
Just tell Mako the good news.

206
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:07,443
Ha-ha-ha...

207
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:08,990
What "good news"?

208
00:11:09,008 --> 00:11:11,079
Well, my daughter
passionately told me

209
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:14,322
all about your harder and
success in pro-bending arena.

210
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:16,634
And about your team's current...

211
00:11:17,022 --> 00:11:19,208
Financial stumbling block.

212
00:11:19,236 --> 00:11:21,317
Now, I'd hate to see
you lose your chance.

213
00:11:21,342 --> 00:11:22,905
at winning the Championship,

214
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:25,226
just because you're short
a few yuans.

215
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:29,314
That's why I'm going to sponsor
the Fire Ferrets in the tournament!

216
00:11:29,316 --> 00:11:30,669
Are you serious?

217
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:34,374
He's serious, my dad's going to cover
your ante for the championship pie.

218
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:36,590
That… That <i>is</i> good news!

219
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:38,440
There's just one catch.

220
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,856
You all have to wear <i>Future Industries</i> logo
on your uniforms.

221
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:44,424
I'll tattoo it on my chest
if you want, Sir!

222
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:45,985
A-ha-ha-ha-ha!

223
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:47,769
Thank you both so much!

224
00:11:48,157 --> 00:11:51,556
I promise the Fire Ferrets will
make most of this opportunity.

225
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:57,703
Outta way daddy,
we're driving here!

226
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:07,391
I see Tarrlok's gifts are getting
more and more extravagant.

227
00:12:07,822 --> 00:12:10,859
Yeah, that guy doesn't know
how to take 'no' for an answer.

228
00:12:10,953 --> 00:12:14,426
Korra, are you...
Doing alright?

229
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:16,605
Yeah, I'm fine...

230
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,151
Why don't you take a break?

231
00:12:20,295 --> 00:12:22,225
I'm glad you turned down Tarrlok,

232
00:12:22,257 --> 00:12:25,224
but I just wanted to make sure
your decision was for the right reason.

233
00:12:25,242 --> 00:12:28,717
I'm just really focused
on my Air bending right now, that's all.

234
00:12:29,314 --> 00:12:32,067
Right, that's...
What you said.

235
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:35,354
You know, it's okay to be scared.

236
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,554
The whole city is frightened
by what's been going on.

237
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:42,666
The important thing
is to talk about our fears,

238
00:12:42,816 --> 00:12:45,823
because, if we don't,
they can throw us out of balance.

239
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:54,051
I'm always here for you,
if you want to talk.

240
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:01,459
Avatar Korra,
I have something for you.

241
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:04,060
It doesn't matter how many gifts
Tarrlok sends,

242
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:05,901
I'm not joining his taskforce!

243
00:13:06,895 --> 00:13:09,702
It's not a gift, it's an invitation.

244
00:13:09,727 --> 00:13:10,977
To what?

245
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,009
Tarrlok is throwing a gala
in your honor.

246
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,004
All of Republic City movers and shakers
will be there.

247
00:13:17,023 --> 00:13:19,871
The councilman humbly requests
your attendance.

248
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:35,282
Can't believe this is all for me.

249
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:38,923
I'm not sure what Tarrlok's plotting,
but keep your guard up.

250
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:42,069
It's not like him to throw a party
just for the fun of it.

251
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:44,964
So glad you could make it,
Avatar Korra.

252
00:13:44,965 --> 00:13:46,370
If you'll excuse us...

253
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:48,813
The City awaits its hero.

254
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,334
Milo, no! That is not a toilet!
Oh, dear…

255
00:13:54,871 --> 00:13:56,719
Korra, it is my pleasure

256
00:13:56,757 --> 00:13:59,928
to introduce Republic City's
most famous industrialist,

257
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:01,565
Hiroshi Sato.

258
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,935
Nice to meet you.

259
00:14:03,664 --> 00:14:06,709
We're all expecting
great things from you.

260
00:14:06,728 --> 00:14:08,017
Right...

261
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:09,279
Greatness.

262
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:10,647
Hey, Korra!

263
00:14:11,595 --> 00:14:14,643
This is my daughter,
Asami.

264
00:14:14,674 --> 00:14:15,889
It's lovely to meet you.

265
00:14:15,914 --> 00:14:18,040
Mako told me so much
about you.

266
00:14:18,077 --> 00:14:20,639
Really?
Because he hasn't mentioned you at all.

267
00:14:20,687 --> 00:14:23,628
- How did you two meet?
- Asami crashed into him on a moped.

268
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:25,695
What? Are you okay?

269
00:14:25,726 --> 00:14:28,274
I'm fine.
More than fine!

270
00:14:28,412 --> 00:14:31,128
Mr. Sato agreed to sponsor our team.

271
00:14:31,147 --> 00:14:32,953
We're back in the tournament!

272
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:34,404
Isn't that great?

273
00:14:34,485 --> 00:14:36,464
Yeah. Terrific.

274
00:14:37,984 --> 00:14:42,220
Chief Beifong, I believe
you and Avatar Korra have already met?

275
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:44,695
Just because this city's throwing you
this big to do.

276
00:14:44,696 --> 00:14:46,424
don't think you're something special.

277
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:49,213
You've done absolutely nothing
to deserve this.

278
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:07,626
If you'd be so kind,
they just have a couple of questions.

279
00:15:07,643 --> 00:15:08,864
But I…

280
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,718
Avatar Korra, you witnessed

281
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:14,117
Amon take away people's bending
firsthand.

282
00:15:14,135 --> 00:15:17,983
How serious a threat does he pose
to the innocent citizens of Republic City?

283
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:22,734
I think he presents a real problem.

284
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,363
Then why have you refused
to join Tarrlok's taskforce?

285
00:15:26,382 --> 00:15:29,151
As the Avatar,
shouldn't you be going <i>after</i> Amon?

286
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:30,767
Well, I…

287
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:32,317
Why are you backing away
from this fight?

288
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:36,243
What? No, I've never backed away
from anything in my life.

289
00:15:36,244 --> 00:15:39,044
You promised to serve this city.
Aren't you going back on that promise now?

290
00:15:39,045 --> 00:15:41,933
Do you think pro-bending is more important
than fighting the revolution?

291
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:43,844
How do you think
Avatar Aang would have handled this?

292
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:45,183
Are you afraid of Amon?

293
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:47,361
I'm not afraid of anybody.

294
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,382
If the City needs me, then...

295
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:53,047
I'll join Tarrlok's taskforce
and help fight Amon.

296
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,280
There's your headline, folks.

297
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,301
My fellow taskforce deputies,

298
00:16:11,739 --> 00:16:15,572
tonight we will execute a raid on
an underground chi-blocker training camp,

299
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:17,806
located in the Dragon Flats borough,

300
00:16:17,868 --> 00:16:19,347
According to my sources,

301
00:16:19,384 --> 00:16:21,873
there is a cellar
underneath this book store,

302
00:16:21,904 --> 00:16:25,402
where Equalists
train chi-blocking in secret.

303
00:17:22,822 --> 00:17:24,341
I'm going after those two.

304
00:17:36,782 --> 00:17:38,742
Nice timing, thanks Tarrlok.

305
00:17:38,847 --> 00:17:40,824
We make a good team, Avatar.

306
00:17:42,888 --> 00:17:44,519
Yeah, we do.

307
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:54,956
No Korra for practice, again?

308
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,508
Doesn't look like it.

309
00:17:59,274 --> 00:18:03,067
Avatar Korra has bravely answered
the call to action.

310
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:04,916
With the two of us
leading the charge,

311
00:18:04,941 --> 00:18:08,735
Republic City has nothing to fear
from Amon and the Equalists.

312
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,175
Question for the Avatar.

313
00:18:10,206 --> 00:18:13,043
Amon remains at large.
Why have you failed to locate him?

314
00:18:13,044 --> 00:18:14,280
You wanna know why?

315
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:17,729
Because Amon is hiding in the shadows,
like a coward.

316
00:18:18,008 --> 00:18:20,939
Amon, I challenge you to a duel!

317
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,941
No taskforce, no chi-blockers...

318
00:18:24,024 --> 00:18:26,731
Just the two of us,
tonight at midnight,

319
00:18:26,743 --> 00:18:29,338
on Avatar Aang
memorial island.

320
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:32,002
Let's cut to the chase
and settle this thing.

321
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:34,207
<i>If</i> you're man enough to face me.

322
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:43,891
I know it sounds weird
to say this,

323
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,185
but I'm really glad
I hit you with my moped.

324
00:18:47,444 --> 00:18:49,190
Ooh… me too!

325
00:18:49,949 --> 00:18:51,318
I forgot to ask...

326
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:54,809
Why didn't you accept the new silk scarf
I bought for you last week?

327
00:18:55,088 --> 00:18:58,156
- You didn't like it?
- No, it was really nice, but…

328
00:18:58,281 --> 00:19:00,283
This scarf was my father's...

329
00:19:00,895 --> 00:19:02,981
And it's all I have left of him.

330
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:05,285
I just feel like...

331
00:19:06,035 --> 00:19:07,605
Like it keeps me safe.

332
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:09,105
I'm so sorry.

333
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,154
I lost my mother
when I was very young.

334
00:19:20,165 --> 00:19:21,978
I feel so safe with you.

335
00:19:30,156 --> 00:19:31,506
Korra, this is madness.

336
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:34,145
Don't try to stop me
and don't follow me.

337
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,094
I have to face Amon alone.

338
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:37,704
This is all your doing!

339
00:19:37,747 --> 00:19:41,395
I tried to talk her out of it too,
but she's made up her mind.

340
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:47,502
We'll be watching the island closely.

341
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:48,715
If anything goes wrong,

342
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,946
I have a fleet of police airships
ready to swoop down.

343
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:40,574
Guess you're a no show, Amon.

344
00:20:41,312 --> 00:20:42,811
Who's scared now?

345
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:25,456
I received your invitation,
young Avatar.

346
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,269
Our showdown, while inevitable,

347
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,828
is premature.

348
00:21:39,245 --> 00:21:41,719
Although it would be
the simplest thing for me

349
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:44,012
to take away your bending
right now...

350
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,636
I won't.

351
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:48,073
You'd only become a martyr.

352
00:21:48,485 --> 00:21:51,522
Benders of every nation
would rally behind your...

353
00:21:51,553 --> 00:21:53,394
untimely demise,

354
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:55,089
but I assure you,

355
00:21:55,234 --> 00:21:57,132
I have a plan...

356
00:21:57,263 --> 00:22:00,227
And I'm saving you for last.

357
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,918
Then, you'll get your duel...

358
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,456
And I <i>will</i> destroy you.

359
00:22:21,714 --> 00:22:23,328
- Aang?
- Korra!

360
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:27,222
Korra, are you alright?
What happened? Was Amon here?

361
00:22:27,618 --> 00:22:28,838
Yeah...

362
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,314
He... ambushed me.

363
00:22:31,345 --> 00:22:34,030
Did he…
Did he take your bending away?

364
00:22:36,207 --> 00:22:37,477
No...

365
00:22:38,332 --> 00:22:40,751
- I'm okay.
- Oh, thank goodness!

366
00:22:44,423 --> 00:22:46,255
I was so terrified!

367
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:48,715
I felt so helpless.

368
00:22:48,838 --> 00:22:50,085
It's alright.

369
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:51,623
The nightmare is over.

370
00:22:51,653 --> 00:22:52,860
You...

371
00:22:53,661 --> 00:22:54,998
You were right.

372
00:22:55,148 --> 00:22:57,279
I've been scared this whole time.

373
00:22:57,967 --> 00:23:00,498
I've never felt like this before,
and...

374
00:23:01,217 --> 00:23:03,315
And I don't know what to do!

375
00:23:05,445 --> 00:23:07,534
Admitting your fears
is the first...

376
00:23:07,571 --> 00:23:11,001
And most difficult step
in overcoming them.

377
00:23:11,843 --> 00:23:16,810
