7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,881
Ugh! Fry!

8
00:00:29,915 --> 00:00:31,148
That's disgusting!

9
00:00:31,182 --> 00:00:32,517
What?
You double-dipped!

10
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:33,751
Geez.

11
00:00:37,188 --> 00:00:39,524
Crew, you're working too hard.

12
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:41,291
Tell me about it.

13
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:43,561
For once,
I thought it might be nice

14
00:00:43,595 --> 00:00:45,496
to do something
in a social setting...

15
00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:47,665
Finally get to know each other.

16
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:49,901
Why, I don't even know
half your names!

17
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:52,069
You, boy.
What do they call you?

18
00:00:52,103 --> 00:00:55,139
Most folks
just call me orange Joe.

19
00:00:55,173 --> 00:00:57,041
So, Professor,
where are we gonna go?

20
00:00:57,075 --> 00:00:58,509
It's July, right?

21
00:00:58,544 --> 00:01:01,679
Let's wait three months
and go to Oktoberfest!

22
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:02,713
(All cheering)

23
00:01:02,748 --> 00:01:03,648
All right, baby!

24
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:13,624
(Whooping)

25
00:01:15,694 --> 00:01:17,194
Bring on the beer!

26
00:01:17,228 --> 00:01:19,063
And the scantily-clad barmaids!

27
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:21,832
And the more beer!

28
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:24,001
Shh! (Playing refined version
of "the beer barrel polka")

29
00:01:24,036 --> 00:01:26,871
Hey! I don't smell
bavarian-style vomit.

30
00:01:26,905 --> 00:01:28,105
Where's Oktoberfest?

31
00:01:28,139 --> 00:01:30,240
This is Oktoberfest...

32
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:32,710
the world's
most sophisticated exhibition

33
00:01:32,744 --> 00:01:35,046
of German food, drink,
and culture.

34
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:40,685
Exquisite.

35
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,252
Care for another, sir?

36
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:45,189
No, I wouldn't want
to ruin my Oktoberfest

37
00:01:45,223 --> 00:01:47,558
by becoming intoxicated.

38
00:01:47,593 --> 00:01:49,293
What the hell is going on here?!

39
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:50,695
Fry, quiet.

40
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,930
Oktoberfest is
a classy celebration

41
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:54,632
of how far humans have evolved.

42
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,634
You need to be
on your best behavior.

43
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:58,069
No chance!

44
00:01:58,103 --> 00:02:00,137
You can all act like
Jersey shore socialites,

45
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:01,706
but at least Bender
will party with me.

46
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,940
Right, buddy?

47
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:04,408
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

48
00:02:04,442 --> 00:02:07,044
I enjoy partying as
much as the next fellow,

49
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,546
but this is Oktoberfest.

50
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:10,881
Good day, sir!

51
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:13,017
<i>Ach du</i> freakin' <i>lieber!</i>

52
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:16,954
A sausage contest, eh?

53
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:18,990
Sounds like fun on a bun!

54
00:02:19,024 --> 00:02:21,592
Shut up!
I said it first!

55
00:02:21,627 --> 00:02:22,827
Man:
Bam!

56
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:24,328
Also, ow.

57
00:02:24,362 --> 00:02:26,964
Oh, my God,
it's celebrity chef Elzar!

58
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:30,334
Hey, Elzar, I've just recently
started always having dreamt

59
00:02:30,368 --> 00:02:32,336
of being a sausage-making
champion.

60
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,604
Can I get in on this?

61
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,172
Sure, I don't care.

62
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:36,473
You bring your ingredients?

63
00:02:36,508 --> 00:02:37,842
You bet!

64
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:39,476
(Snorts)

65
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:41,112
Hold on there, chief.

66
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:43,247
Regular old pork ain't
gonna win this thing.

67
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:45,116
You gotta get innovative
with your meat.

68
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,684
See chef Fritz over there?

69
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:49,654
He's only using the choicest
cuts of hummingbird.

70
00:02:49,688 --> 00:02:53,590
Murakami-San got his hands on
a nice rack of angel wings.

71
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,592
Gonna grind 'em up
into heavenwurst.

72
00:02:55,627 --> 00:02:57,261
And me?

73
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:59,864
I'm making my spice-weaseled
bratwurst outta pork.

74
00:02:59,898 --> 00:03:01,532
So you are using pork!

75
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:04,501
Pork that's been aged
for 3,000 years!

76
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:06,436
Bam!

77
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:09,339
Aw, man! I can't beat that
with a Craigslist pig.

78
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:10,607
(Pig grunts)

79
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:12,376
Sorry, grundy.

80
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,478
I'll have to kill you later
for some other reason.

81
00:03:14,512 --> 00:03:16,580
(Orchestra playing
elegant music)

82
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,788
(Grunting)

83
00:03:23,822 --> 00:03:25,022
Sit up straight!

84
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:27,024
The countess Von Luftballoon
is watching.

85
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:28,325
Ach!

86
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:30,895
Man, all the fun
has been taken out

87
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:33,297
of this once-noble
barf-a-palooza.

88
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:35,199
You just say that
because you're primitive.

89
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:37,234
People in your day were
backwards and crude.

90
00:03:37,268 --> 00:03:38,903
Well, at least we were hammered!

91
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:41,172
Oh, I'm as thirsty as a drunk.

92
00:03:41,206 --> 00:03:43,674
Where do all these
child-sized beers come from?

93
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:44,909
See that magnificent

94
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:46,510
heavily guarded cask?

95
00:03:46,544 --> 00:03:48,212
All the beer's in there.

96
00:03:48,246 --> 00:03:49,747
(Slurps, sighs)

97
00:03:52,017 --> 00:03:53,650
(Spitting)

98
00:03:55,754 --> 00:03:58,488
Not all the beer.

99
00:04:00,192 --> 00:04:02,727
(Drunkenly):
Yay! Whoo-hoo!

100
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:04,028
<i>Fahrvergnügen!</i>

101
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:06,097
Kaiser permanente!

102
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:07,698
Fru... frusen gladje!

103
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:09,566
Fry! You're
embarrassing us!

104
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:12,369
I don't care!
I'm finally having fun!

105
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:14,939
Hey, come on,
you keister-meisters!

106
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:16,907
<i>Eins, zwei, drei, vier!</i>

107
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:19,176
Lift your Stein
and drink your beer!

108
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:21,011
<i>Ich bin ein</i> never!

109
00:04:21,046 --> 00:04:22,747
Oh!

110
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:24,882
(Orchestra playing refined
version of "the chicken dance")

111
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,250
Whoa!

112
00:04:26,284 --> 00:04:28,552
Even with harps,
that's still the famous

113
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:30,287
Oktoberfest chicken dance!

114
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,359
(All groaning, gasping)

115
00:04:35,393 --> 00:04:37,128
Oh, I almost forgot!

116
00:04:37,162 --> 00:04:39,029
(Chicken hats squeaking)

117
00:04:39,064 --> 00:04:40,931
Get das Booty up here, Leela!

118
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:42,532
I brought his-and-her
chicken hats!

119
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:43,768
(Squeaks)

120
00:04:43,802 --> 00:04:45,369
Okay, that's it.

121
00:04:45,403 --> 00:04:47,938
You are a boorish,
primitive neanderthal!

122
00:04:47,973 --> 00:04:50,540
Neander-(Hiccups)-Thal?

123
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:52,076
Yes.
And I've had enough!

124
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,744
I'm breaking up with you!

125
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:54,979
(Gasps)

126
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:56,247
We were going out?!

127
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:58,448
Whoo!

128
00:04:58,483 --> 00:05:01,252
I mean, nooo!

129
00:05:01,286 --> 00:05:03,788
And keep your stupid
chicken hat, too!

130
00:05:03,822 --> 00:05:05,722
(Weeps quietly)

131
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:12,062
...and-and the worst part is,
I had to have

132
00:05:12,097 --> 00:05:13,831
the breakup sex by myself!

133
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:15,166
(Sobs)

134
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,835
Fry, some of us
have real problems.

135
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:19,236
I just learned there are people

136
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:21,672
with fancier
sausage meats than me!

137
00:05:21,706 --> 00:05:24,241
(Sobbing)

138
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:26,643
I hate future Oktoberfest!

139
00:05:26,678 --> 00:05:29,646
It's supposed to be beer and
bratwurst, not breakups and...

140
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:31,548
Boring thing!

141
00:05:33,185 --> 00:05:34,985
German narrator:
For hundreds of years,

142
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,989
Oktoberfest has been held here,
in the fertile neander valley,

143
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:41,458
where prehistoric man
once hunted

144
00:05:41,492 --> 00:05:45,429
the majestic schnüfel-üfagus,
or woolly mammoth.

145
00:05:45,463 --> 00:05:50,267
To this day, paleontologists
sometimes find entire mammoths

146
00:05:50,302 --> 00:05:52,870
frozen in
the valley's icy glaciers,

147
00:05:52,904 --> 00:05:56,807
perfectly preserved for exactly
30,000 years or so.

148
00:05:56,842 --> 00:05:58,275
Bender:
Wait a minute...

149
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,178
Mammoth meat aged
for 30,000 years?

150
00:06:01,213 --> 00:06:03,948
Prize-winning sausage
meat, here I come!

151
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:11,388
(Beeping rhythmically)

152
00:06:11,422 --> 00:06:13,958
I didn't know this ship
had a mammoth detector.

153
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:15,192
You're drunk, Fry.

154
00:06:15,227 --> 00:06:16,961
This is the elephant detector.

155
00:06:16,995 --> 00:06:18,829
I just set it
to "big and woolly."

156
00:06:18,864 --> 00:06:20,664
(Beeping)

157
00:06:20,698 --> 00:06:21,899
Mammoth ahoy!

158
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:27,304
Uh, Bender?

159
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:28,705
I smell burning tusk.

160
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,974
That's probably it.

161
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:31,141
Kill the engine.

162
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:35,645
(Bender grunting)

163
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,985
(Grunting echoing)

164
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:46,590
(Grunting with effort)

165
00:06:53,231 --> 00:06:55,266
(Grunting)

166
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:57,768
(Chuckling)

Third place?

332
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:25,412
This is the greatest injustice

333
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,548
Germany has ever committed!

334
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,618
Ah, Leela, we meet again.

335
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:33,454
But this time I'm the one
criticizing the sausage.

336
00:14:33,488 --> 00:14:35,355
(Rumbling)

337
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,891
Ah...
(Gasps)

338
00:14:41,897 --> 00:14:43,030

(Trumpeting, war cries)

340
00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:53,240
Dear God, look at those
hairy elephantés!

341
00:14:53,274 --> 00:14:55,610
Kill all modern humans!

342
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,877
Hey, this guy's all right.

343
00:14:56,912 --> 00:14:58,112

Battalion B,
smash different things!

♪

354
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:38,285
Aw, yeah.
Second place!

355
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:43,558
Release the giant sloth!

356

Do something!

362
00:16:02,611 --> 00:16:03,845
Fear not, Leela.

363
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,814
They may not have
technology, like us,

364
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:10,585
but we have something
they don't have: Technology.

365
00:16:12,187 --> 00:16:14,555
Behold our latest weapon,

366
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,324
a revolutionary fleet
of unmanned drones.

367
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:18,726
With men in them.

368
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,528
Then how are they unmanned?

369
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,363
The men are just for ballast.

370
00:16:22,397 --> 00:16:25,366
I control all the drones
from this single unit.

371
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,435
Foolproof and durable,
it's designed to withstand

372
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,105
even the weight of
a modern-day elephant foot.

373

Neanderthals, load catapult!

Up here in the clouds, our
technology makes us invincible,

383
00:17:24,993 --> 00:17:27,762
like the mighty "x"
in tic-tac-toe.

384
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,264
Look at those pathetic
cavemen down there,

385
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:32,399
loading their silly
catapult with...

386
00:17:32,434 --> 00:17:33,834
What is that, Kif?

(Screaming)

390
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:53,120
I guess it's just me and
you, chicken hat. (Squeaks)

391
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:03,297
Die, you primitive brute!

What do you neanderthals want?

397
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:26,020
We want our land back!

398
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:27,989
Also, to be treated as equals!

399
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,657
And a little mating
wouldn't hurt!

(Hat squeaks)

401
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,804
Orange?

402

Purple?

403

What orange-hair doing
with homo sapien?

407
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,927
Uh...
Look like interbreeding.

(Grunting painfully)

409
00:19:09,397 --> 00:19:11,265
You want make love, not war?

410
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:12,266
<i>Jawohl!</i>

411
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:17,204
This change everything,
tight-clothes-man.

412
00:19:17,238 --> 00:19:19,674
We forgive homo sapiens

413
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:23,210
for actions of stuck-up ancestors.
So be it.

414
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:25,880
In recognition of your
overwhelming victory,

415

Leela?

420
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,138
I didn't recognize you with
your head all swollen.

421
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:52,639
But it looks better now.

422
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:55,076
I guess the blood must have
rushed somewhere else.

423
00:19:55,844 --> 00:19:56,623
Guys, guys!

424
00:19:56,743 --> 00:19:59,747
Chef Fritz accidentally got
thrown down an icy slope!

425

I'm the sausage champion!

426
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:04,284

(Laughing)

432
00:20:28,877 --> 00:20:31,245
Now this is Oktoberfest!

433
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,847
Just like the olden days.

434
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:35,582
I have to admit,
your version is more fun.

Care to join me?

439
00:20:42,057 --> 00:20:43,924
No, Leela.

440
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:46,393
Just this once, I'm going
to let <i>you</i> embarrass <i>me.</i>
