1
00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:09,403  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:061 Y2:087
The Luck of the Fryfish

2
00:00:36,613 --> 00:00:41,846  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:061 Y2:127
- Push, Mrs. Fry. You're almost there.
- Squeeze one out for America, honey.

3
00:00:42,053 --> 00:00:44,248  X1:237 X2:478 Y1:061 Y2:126
Keep it down,
it's the 9th inning.

4
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:49,533  X1:149 X2:564 Y1:061 Y2:121
<i>Here's the 0-2 pitch to Crypool.</i>
<i>He's called on a strike three.</i>

5
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:51,251  X1:196 X2:518 Y1:490 Y2:516
Swing the bat, you bum!

6
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:57,887  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:061 Y2:127
- It's a boy with red hair.
- You saying my son's a commie?

7
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:03,161  X1:144 X2:568 Y1:061 Y2:121
<i>And Groady leans into the pitch.</i>
<i>It hits him. The Mets win.</i>

8
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,927  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:061 Y2:087
This is the happiest day of my life.

9
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:08,402  X1:238 X2:477 Y1:061 Y2:127
- Here's your baby.
- Okay, thanks.

10
00:01:08,573 --> 00:01:11,883  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:061 Y2:126
- What should we name him?
- You pick. I picked dinner.

11
00:01:12,093 --> 00:01:15,403  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:061 Y2:121
I was thinking of Philip,
after those screwdrivers.

12
00:01:15,613 --> 00:01:18,764  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:061 Y2:127
That's a fantastic idea.
More morphine, please!

13
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:24,325  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:061 Y2:127
- Look, Yancy, it's baby Philip.
- I wanna be named Philip.

14
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:26,768  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:061 Y2:087
Me Philip! Me Philip!

15
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:32,008  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:061 Y2:126
Son, your name is Yancy, just like me,
and my grandfather and so on.

16
00:01:32,173 --> 00:01:35,529  X1:185 X2:529 Y1:061 Y2:126
All the way back
to minuteman Yancy Fry...

17
00:01:35,693 --> 00:01:38,924  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:061 Y2:121
...who blasted commies
in the American Revolution.

18
00:01:40,813 --> 00:01:44,362  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:456 Y2:516
Philip, until I find a suitable
model of an ICBM...

19
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:48,446  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:450 Y2:516
...you'll have to make do
fearing this toy spacecraft.

20
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,127  X1:282 X2:433 Y1:495 Y2:516
Mine! Mine!

21
00:02:14,693 --> 00:02:17,207  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Come on!
- Baby needs new shoes.

22
00:02:17,373 --> 00:02:20,171  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:456 Y2:516
To hell with your baby.
I need those shoes.

23
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:27,411  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>It's a dead heat. They're checking</i>
<i>the electron microscope.</i>

24
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:32,409  X1:177 X2:543 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>The winner is Number Three</i>
<i>in a quantum finish.</i>

25
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:36,692  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:451 Y2:516
No fair! You changed the outcome
by measuring it.

26
00:02:36,853 --> 00:02:40,766  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:451 Y2:516
- How did you do, Fry?
- I'll tell you when my horse finishes.

27
00:02:40,933 --> 00:02:41,968  X1:330 X2:385 Y1:495 Y2:516
Bad.

28
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:46,453  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:061 Y2:126
We owned four horses
and two jockeys.

29
00:02:46,693 --> 00:02:50,288  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:451 Y2:516
We just put a jockey out to stud.
He's perfect for you.

30
00:02:51,013 --> 00:02:53,652  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hey, baby, ever do it in a suitcase?

31
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:56,043  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:492 Y2:516
Look, it's a centaur race.

32
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:02,846  X1:231 X2:484 Y1:493 Y2:516
Come on, come on!

33
00:03:03,013 --> 00:03:06,483  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:451 Y2:516
Hey, Leela, how about a kiss
for good luck?

34
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:08,532  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:490 Y2:516
I meant tongue luck.

35
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:13,886  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:492 Y2:516
<i>The winner is Number Four, Steven.</i>

36
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:18,444  X1:186 X2:528 Y1:455 Y2:516
I've run over black cats
that were luckier than me.

37
00:03:18,653 --> 00:03:22,771  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:454 Y2:516
Get your hot horse-burgers,
horse-fries, horse-cakes and shakes.

38
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:26,926  X1:089 X2:626 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Tongue straight from the horse's mouth.
- It all sounds good.

39
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:31,763  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:451 Y2:516
All our horses are 1 00% horse-fed
for that double juiced-in goodness.

40
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:35,329  X1:184 X2:530 Y1:455 Y2:516
I'll have a cholesterol-free
omelet with horse-beaters.

41
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:38,849  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:456 Y2:516
- How can I horse you, sir?
- I'll have a horse Coke.

42
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:41,089  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Horse Pepsi okay?
- Neigh!

43
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:02,765  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Hey! What are you doing?
- This.

44
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:09,243  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:516
Dear Horse God, I don't usually pray.
Sometimes I doubt you even exist.

45
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:13,964  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:450 Y2:516
But if you're willing to grant me luck,
please, stamp your hoof once.

46
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:22,010  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:493 Y2:516
Come on, Number Six. Move it!

47
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:26,972  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:489 Y2:516
Don't do that. What are you...?

48
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,561  X1:258 X2:458 Y1:489 Y2:516
It's contagious.

49
00:04:29,213 --> 00:04:33,491  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>And the winner is Harry Trotter</i>
<i>by the entire racetrack.</i>

50
00:04:36,213 --> 00:04:38,966  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:450 Y2:516
That'll teach those horses
to take drugs.

51
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:43,488  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's it! You can only take
my money for so long...

52
00:04:43,653 --> 00:04:46,292  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:451 Y2:516
...before you take it all.
I say, enough!

53
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:51,084  X1:156 X2:558 Y1:450 Y2:516
I've got one dollar left,
and this one I'm holding on to.

54
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:52,567  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:489 Y2:516
Oh, no, you don't.

55
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:07,323  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:451 Y2:516
I may not know about horses, but I
know lots about doing anything for $ 1.

56
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:18,124  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:451 Y2:516
If you think bad luck can defeat me,
you don't know my name is Philip J...

57
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:30,209  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:490 Y2:516
That is one unlucky guy.

58
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:41,323  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:451 Y2:516
Kareem has the sky hook,
but Philip J. Fry has the space hook.

59
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:49,171  X1:161 X2:553 Y1:451 Y2:516
Yancy drives, he goes up
with his patented space hook.

60
00:05:49,373 --> 00:05:52,763  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:455 Y2:516
Hey! That's my patented space hook.
You stole it.

61
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:55,891  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:489 Y2:516
You're not the president of it.

62
00:06:02,453 --> 00:06:05,172  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:490 Y2:516
Holy camolie! A seven-leaf clover.

63
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,801  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:489 Y2:516
I'm dying of old age!

64
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:21,732  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:451 Y2:516
Game over! Phil wins.
Yancy's fans are stunned.

65
00:06:21,893 --> 00:06:25,124  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:516
There'll be no celebration
at the Yancy Dome.

66
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:26,487  X1:316 X2:399 Y1:490 Y2:516
Lucky!

67
00:06:35,053 --> 00:06:36,725  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:489 Y2:516
Someone's in a good mode.

68
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:40,926  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:516
Let's say I lucked out at the track.
Also I rigged one race.

69
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:45,405  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:455 Y2:516
I'd have won too, if I still had my
seven-leaf clover.

70
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,081  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:489 Y2:516
Plus, I'd still have my hair.

71
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:52,087  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:451 Y2:516
I got your page, Mr. Fry.
Your new hair is ready.

72
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:55,364  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:490 Y2:516
What happened to this clover?

73
00:06:55,573 --> 00:07:00,089  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:451 Y2:516
I hid it in a secret place and never
told anyone. Not even Scruffy.

74
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:07,163  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:451 Y2:516
- So is it still in the hiding place?
- Yeah, maybe it is still there.

75
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:11,326  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:451 Y2:516
In the ruins of Old New York.
Helping one ant defeat another.

76
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:15,611  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Or giving luck to a piece of dirt.
- Dirt doesn't need luck.

77
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:18,043  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:489 Y2:516
I'm going to get my clover back!

78
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:22,092  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516
Some of the tunnels have metal bars.
Who's good at bending?

79
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:23,845  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:456 Y2:516
- How about you?
- Sure.

80
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:26,971  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:455 Y2:516
- But Bending's my middle name.
- It is?

81
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:31,126  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:451 Y2:516
Yep. My full name is
Bender Bending Rodriguez.

82
00:07:33,613 --> 00:07:38,971  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:450 Y2:516
Here's the entrance. From this moment,
I declare my bad luck officially over.

83
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:43,888  X1:280 X2:435 Y1:495 Y2:516
He was fun.

84
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:55,048  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:451 Y2:516
If we get bored looking for the clover,
I've got Tetris on this thing.

85
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:58,011  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Look, up ahead.
- Old New York.

86
00:07:58,213 --> 00:08:01,364  X1:211 X2:503 Y1:451 Y2:516
The city that inspired
a casino in Las Vegas.

87
00:08:02,293 --> 00:08:04,682  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:455 Y2:516
We've got Manhattan
all to ourselves.

88
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:08,209  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:451 Y2:516
I can finally do the crazy stuff
I always dreamed.

89
00:08:08,893 --> 00:08:12,408  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:495 Y2:516
Howard Stern is overrated.

90
00:08:14,413 --> 00:08:16,881  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Oops!
- New York is so burned.

91
00:08:17,093 --> 00:08:20,005  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:451 Y2:516
Remember when Giuliani
cracked down on jaywalking?

92
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:22,966  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:456 Y2:516
Well, Rudy, how do you like
this action?

93
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:33,366  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:451 Y2:516
The big breakdance battle
is Saturday.

94
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:36,809  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:451 Y2:516
If we wanna win
Jam Master Jay's parachute pants...

95
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:40,727  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:456 Y2:516
...our crew has to pop,
lock and bust the freshest.

96
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:43,532  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:490 Y2:516
Noticeably F.A.T., drop us a beat.

97
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,131  X1:290 X2:426 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Name?
- Cosmic F.

98
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,403  X1:271 X2:444 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Style?
- Outer space.

99
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:54,247  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Special moves?
- The moonwalk.

100
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:58,884  X1:282 X2:432 Y1:456 Y2:516
The robot.
The zero G.

101
00:08:59,493 --> 00:09:01,324  X1:288 X2:427 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Name?
- Cosmic Y.

102
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:03,928  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Style?
- Deep Space.

103
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,361  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:490 Y2:516
Deep Space?!

104
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:08,167  X1:248 X2:468 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Special moves?
- The space-walk.

105
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:11,052  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:456 Y2:516
- The robot.
- That's similar to mine.

106
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:14,523  X1:282 X2:432 Y1:495 Y2:516
The zero G.

107
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:18,766  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:451 Y2:516
- You totally ripped off my routine.
- You calling me a biter?

108
00:09:20,013 --> 00:09:24,689  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:451 Y2:516
Why do you always have to steal
everything from me, Yancy?

109
00:09:24,893 --> 00:09:28,681  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Stop illing. Word.
- I'd like to see you steal this:

110
00:09:28,853 --> 00:09:30,605  X1:202 X2:512 Y1:490 Y2:516
The septuple head-spin!

111
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:35,248  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:450 Y2:516
He's just scratching. No one's done
more than a quadruple.

112
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:38,769  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:451 Y2:516
Oh, yeah? Noticeably F.A.T.,
rewind the tape.

113
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:55,447  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:490 Y2:516
Crazy sucker.

114
00:09:57,293 --> 00:10:00,649  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:453 Y2:516
- Phil, you're hot.
- That was ice-cold, bro.

115
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:04,806  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:451 Y2:516
Fry, if I ever see you try
anything that crazy again...

116
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:08,807  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:451 Y2:516
...this crew might just have
some new parachute pants.

117
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,651  X1:197 X2:517 Y1:490 Y2:516
Stop hogging the clover.

118
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:31,126  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Let's go find that clover.
- Which way to your house?

119
00:10:31,293 --> 00:10:36,367  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:455 Y2:516
- The sign says we're at 71 st Street.
- 71 st Street? Never heard of it.

120
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:41,812  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Downtown could be in any direction.
- We'll just take a spin on the B-train.

121
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:46,491  X1:247 X2:467 Y1:490 Y2:516
That feels funny!

122
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:51,925  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:451 Y2:516
This is the Brooklyn-bound B-train,
stopping wherever I feel like.

123
00:10:52,093 --> 00:10:55,642  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:490 Y2:516
Watch for the closing doors.

124
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:12,043  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:490 Y2:516
Wake up, buddy. End of the line.

125
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:16,012  X1:217 X2:498 Y1:490 Y2:516
My old neighborhood.

126
00:11:17,173 --> 00:11:22,531  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's the bench where I found shirts.
We used to light that hydrant on fire!

127
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:26,572  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:456 Y2:516
On that corner, some guy
handed out a socialist newsletter.

128
00:11:26,813 --> 00:11:29,122  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Was it poorly xeroxed?
- Oh, yeah.

129
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:32,808  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:456 Y2:516
The comedians were right.
This is different from L.A.

130
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:37,488  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Did you say you used to live here?
- That's right.

131
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:41,442  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Did you know Andy Goldman?
- He was my neighbor. Why?

132
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:46,164  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:451 Y2:516
- I mutated from him.
- What's he up to these days?

133
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,970  X1:274 X2:442 Y1:489 Y2:516
I'm teaching.

134
00:11:49,453 --> 00:11:52,013  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:454 Y2:516
- He seemed nice.
- Sure, when he's sober.

135
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:59,449  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:456 Y2:516
Holy camolie! The house I grew up in,
it's still there!

136
00:11:59,613 --> 00:12:03,492  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:451 Y2:516
Man, Father Time really took
a bat to this place.

137
00:12:05,973 --> 00:12:10,524  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:451 Y2:516
That stupid clover is a worthless
piece of garbage. Give it!

138
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:12,525  X1:286 X2:430 Y1:490 Y2:516
Mom, help!

139
00:12:13,853 --> 00:12:14,922  X1:330 X2:385 Y1:495 Y2:516
Yes!

140
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:19,803  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Yancy's trying to steal my clover.
- Yancy, stealing is wrong.

141
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:23,807  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:455 Y2:516
I'm gonna pile drive you.
You're dead meat!

142
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:28,568  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:516
What's happening?
Did Kremlin Joe let fly with the nukes?

143
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:32,282  X1:147 X2:567 Y1:451 Y2:516
Not yet, commander.
Yancy's trying to steal my stuff.

144
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:35,286  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:456 Y2:516
He better keep his hands
off these bananas.

145
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:39,651  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:451 Y2:516
Gonna need them when the radiation
turns us all into monkeys.

146
00:12:41,973 --> 00:12:47,411  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:451 Y2:516
The Ronco Record Vault. Yancy will
never get his hands on you in here.

147
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:52,126  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:495 Y2:516
<i>The Breakfast Club</i> soundtrack.

148
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:56,844  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:516
I can't wait until I'm old enough
to feel ways about stuff.

149
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:04,085  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:451 Y2:516
Stay safe, clover.
I may need you again someday.

150
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:16,282  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:456 Y2:516
My dad spent years turning this
into a bomb shelter.

151
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:20,685  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Yet there was no nuclear war.
- What a waste.

152
00:13:20,893 --> 00:13:24,932  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:490 Y2:516
This is it. My Ronco Record Vault.

153
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,609  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:495 Y2:516
I still remember the combination.

154
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:30,968  X1:317 X2:398 Y1:495 Y2:516
Three.

155
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:32,168  X1:293 X2:422 Y1:494 Y2:516
It's stuck.

156
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:37,885  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:450 Y2:516
The Achilles' heel of the Ronco design
is its structural resonance frequency.

157
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:49,690  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:490 Y2:516
There we go.

158
00:13:50,093 --> 00:13:54,723  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:455 Y2:516
- Here's <i>The Breakfast Club</i> soundtrack.
- You mean breakfast club sandwich?

159
00:13:54,893 --> 00:14:00,331  X1:107 X2:607 Y1:451 Y2:516
I hid my clover in the jacket
so my brother, Yancy, wouldn't get it.

160
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:02,324  X1:289 X2:426 Y1:490 Y2:516
Here goes.

161
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:06,771  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:455 Y2:516
It's gone! The whole place
has been cleaned out.

162
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:11,324  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Yancy stole my clover.
- How do you know it didn't disintegrate?

163
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:15,845  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:061 Y2:126
- Everything else held up okay.
- Except <i>Sports</i>, by Huey Lewis.

164
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:23,489  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:451 Y2:516
- My brother hated me so much.
- Brothers always fight.

165
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:28,568  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:451 Y2:516
He just never got a chance to say
he loved you before you got frozen.

166
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:32,089  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:456 Y2:516
You think? Because I always
kind of wished that...

167
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:36,648  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Who is that godlike figure?
- It's my brother, Yancy.

168
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:41,364  X1:138 X2:576 Y1:455 Y2:516
And there's my seven-leaf clover.
I knew he stole it.

169
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:45,891  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:061 Y2:127
If that's Yancy, why does
the inscription say Philip J. Fry?

170
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,169  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:061 Y2:088
Wait a second. That's my name.

171
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,962  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:456 Y2:516
Good Lord! He ditched his goofy name
and stole mine.

172
00:14:52,213 --> 00:14:56,286  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:456 Y2:516
Apparently, this brave adonis,
this Cadillac of men...

173
00:14:56,693 --> 00:15:00,163  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:516
...was the "first person on Mars."
- First person on Mars?!

174
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,369  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:494 Y2:516
That should've been me!

175
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:06,446  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:451 Y2:516
He stole my clover, he stole my name
and he stole my life.

176
00:15:07,293 --> 00:15:11,206  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:451 Y2:516
- And now he broke my hand.
- His legend lives on.

177
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:19,009  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:451 Y2:516
You opened the vault,
and the clover was gone?

178
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:23,405  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:456 Y2:516
Nothing in there
but the best music of the 1 980s.

179
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:27,452  X1:112 X2:602 Y1:451 Y2:516
Survivor, Pat Benatar, The Scorpions.
The list goes on.

180
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:31,129  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:451 Y2:516
My brother stole my dream
of going into space.

181
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:34,649  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Now I'll never get there.
- You went this morning.

182
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:39,205  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:061 Y2:127
"First person on Mars."
So your brother was that Philip J. Fry.

183
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:44,523  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I'm Philip J. Fry! He stole my name.
- Shut up, friends.

184
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:51,041  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:516
My browser heard the word "Fry"
and found the Philip J. Fry movie.

185
00:15:51,893 --> 00:15:56,364  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:456 Y2:516
It also opened my calendar to Friday
and ordered some french fries.

186

201
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:59,766  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:451 Y2:516

202
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:02,527  X1:268 X2:448 Y1:489 Y2:516

Yancy, that tux got me through
Nam in style.

205
00:17:14,053 --> 00:17:19,081  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
- I wish your bother could see this.
- I remember the day he disappeared.

206
00:17:19,253 --> 00:17:23,087  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:454 Y2:516
Wisconsin won the Rose Bowl 1 7-9.
Oh, I miss him.

207
00:17:23,253 --> 00:17:27,565  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516
I was gonna rummage through
Phil's records to play at the wedding.

208
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:31,089  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:451 Y2:516
He may be missing,
but his crap sure isn't.

209
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:03,761  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Breakfast Club.</i> This will clear
the room after the reception.

210
00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:20,162  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:450 Y2:516
He's buried in the world heroes
section? I'm impressed.

211
00:18:20,373 --> 00:18:23,285  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:490 Y2:516
I should be the one in that grave!

212
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:37,924  X1:254 X2:460 Y1:495 Y2:516
We lost Bender.

213
00:18:38,093 --> 00:18:42,769  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:451 Y2:516
Now no one will be able to say
I don't own John Larroquette's spine.

214
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:46,924  X1:194 X2:520 Y1:489 Y2:516
Aha! My brother's grave!

215
00:18:50,053 --> 00:18:52,692  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:061 Y2:088
"Philip Fry, the original Martian."

216
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:56,807  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:455 Y2:516
It's all lies. He wasn't original.
He wasn't a Martian.

217
00:18:56,973 --> 00:19:02,525  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:455 Y2:516
- He wasn't Philip. He wasn't a "the."
- You're twice the "the" he ever was.

218
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:04,331  X1:237 X2:478 Y1:489 Y2:516
It's clovering time.

219
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:25,011  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:451 Y2:516
- So, had any ideas for names, Yancy?
- I'm sort of thinking one.

220
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:29,883  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:451 Y2:516
Daddy has a present for you.
Know what it is? It's a lucky clover...

221
00:19:30,053 --> 00:19:33,443  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:451 Y2:516
...to help you be successful,
even at breakdancing.

222
00:19:33,613 --> 00:19:36,411  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:490 Y2:516
It belonged to someone very special.

223
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:39,804  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:451 Y2:516
I know what name you want
to give him. It's okay.

224
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:44,489  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:450 Y2:516
Really? Son, I'm naming you
Philip J. Fry...

225
00:19:44,653 --> 00:19:49,283  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:451 Y2:516
...in honor of my little brother,
who I miss every day.

226
00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:54,129  X1:242 X2:473 Y1:061 Y2:126
I love you, Philip.
And I always will.

227
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:07,285  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:455 Y2:516
"Here lies Philip J. Fry,
named for his uncle...

228
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:10,684  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:489 Y2:516
...to carry on his spirit."

229
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:17,603  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:451 Y2:516
Pay dirt! I got the clover, plus his
wedding ring. Sorry, ladies, I'm taken.

230
00:20:17,773 --> 00:20:21,448  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:451 Y2:516
Hey, Fry, you want me
to smack the corpse up a little?

231
00:20:28,613 --> 00:20:31,252  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:456 Y2:516
Bender, I think Fry
needs a moment alone.

232
00:20:31,453 --> 00:20:35,810  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:455 Y2:516
Okay, grab a shovel. I'm one skull
short of a Mouseketeer reunion.
