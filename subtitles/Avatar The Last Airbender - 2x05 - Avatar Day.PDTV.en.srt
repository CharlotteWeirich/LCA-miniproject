<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

11

<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:36,989
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,612
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

Book Two: Earth
Chapter Five: Avatar Day

15
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:13,106
What are you doing in my mouth?!

16
00:01:13,152 --> 00:01:18,596
Momo, you need to be a little more sensitive to my boundaries.

17
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:28,016
Give up! You're completely surrounded!

18
00:01:28,863 --> 00:01:31,511
Come on, come on, come on!

19
00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:34,369
My scrolls!

20
00:01:35,288 --> 00:01:37,821
My staff!

21
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:03,948
Yip, yip!

22
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:08,975
Wait, my boomerang!

23
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:10,171
There's no time!

24
00:02:10,184 --> 00:02:13,602
Oh, I see. There's time to get your scrolls and time to get your staff,...

25
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:15,304
...but no time for my boomerang?

26
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,427
That's correct!

27
00:02:16,438 --> 00:02:18,860
Oh.

28
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:24,424
Sorry about your boomerang, Sokka.

29
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,021
I feel like I've lost part of my identity.

30
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:33,845
Imagine if you lost your arrow, or if Katara lost her... hair loopies.

31
00:02:35,393 --> 00:02:37,884
Here's your produce, ponytail guy.

32
00:02:37,893 --> 00:02:41,326
I used to be boomerang guy...

33
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,429
Hey, Water Tribe money.

34
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,909
I hope that's okay.

35
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:49,338
So long as it's money.

36
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:52,782
Have a nice Avatar Day!

37
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:54,180
Avatar Day?

38
00:02:54,203 --> 00:02:57,941
You guys are going to the festival, right?

39
00:03:03,944 --> 00:03:07,277
There's a holiday for the Avatar. Who knew?

40
00:03:07,293 --> 00:03:11,443
Look! They made a giant Kyoshi float.

41
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,023
And here comes Avatar Roku.

42
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,620
Having a huge festival in your honor is great,...

43
00:03:18,638 --> 00:03:21,505
...but frankly, it's just nice to be appreciated.

44
00:03:21,515 --> 00:03:25,110
And it's nice to appreciate their deep-fried festival food.

45
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,522
Aang, look!

46
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:29,787
That's the biggest me I've ever seen.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,326
Now a torch, that's a nice prop. It's bright, dangerous... smells manly.

48
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:44,837
But I'm not sure I could carry it off.

49
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,926
Hey, what's that guy doing?

50
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:57,727
Down with the Avatar! Down with the Avatar! Down with the Avatar!

51
00:04:25,326 --> 00:04:27,167
Where did you get these?

52
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:30,728
What does it matter where they came from?

53
00:04:34,595 --> 00:04:39,329
Down with the Avatar! Down with the Avatar!

54
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:56,172
Hey! That party-pooper's ruining Avatar Day!

55
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:59,604
That party-pooper's my friend!

56
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,374
It's the Avatar himself!

57
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,596
It's going to kill us with its awesome Avatar powers!

58
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,891
No, I'm not, I...

59
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:13,912
I suggest you leave. You're not welcome here, Avatar.

60
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:16,525
Why not? Aang helps people.

61
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,285
It's true. I'm on your side.

62
00:05:19,296 --> 00:05:24,875
I find that hard to swallow considering what you did to us in your past life.

63
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:30,352
It was Avatar Kyoshi, she murdered our glorious leader, Chin the Great.

64
00:05:30,368 --> 00:05:33,460
You think that I... murdered someone?

65
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:38,351
We used to be a great society before you killed our leader. Now look at us!

66
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,200
Huh!

67
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:41,443
Aang would never do something like that.

68
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:45,800
No Avatar would. And it's not fair for you all to question his honor!

69
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:50,766
Let's tell her what we think of the Avatar's "honor."

70
00:05:53,213 --> 00:05:55,950
Give me a chance to clear my name.

71
00:05:55,961 --> 00:06:00,607
The only way to prove your innocence is to stand trial.

72
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,822
I'll gladly stand trial.

73
00:06:02,835 --> 00:06:08,179
You'll have to follow all our rules. That includes paying bail.

74
00:06:08,184 --> 00:06:10,821
No problem!

75
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:15,351
How was I supposed to know they wouldn't take Water Tribe money?

76
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,079
So some people don't like you. Big deal!

77
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:24,651
There's a whole nation of firebenders who hate you.

78
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:26,607
Now let's bust you out of here.

79
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:27,670
I can't.

80
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:31,467
Sure you can! A little... swish, swish, swish!

81
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,866
Airbending slice! ... and we're on our way.

82
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:37,661
I think what "Master Swish" is trying to say...

83
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:40,118
...is that you're supposed to be out saving the world.

84
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,221
You can't do that locked up in here.

85
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:45,388
I can't do that with people thinking I'm a murderer, either.

86
00:06:45,393 --> 00:06:47,802
I need you guys to help prove my innocence.

87
00:06:47,813 --> 00:06:51,761
How're we gonna do that? The crime happened over three hundred years ago.

88
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:56,871
That's okay, Sokka. For some reason,
I thought you were an expert detective.

89
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,931
Well, I guess I could be classified as such.

90
00:07:00,945 --> 00:07:06,882
Yeah! Back home he was famous for solving the mystery of the missing seal jerky.

91
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:09,243
Everyone wanted to blame it on a polar leopard...

92
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,950
...but I figured out that it was Old Man Jarco wearing polar leopard boots.

93
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,792
See, a real eight hundred pound polar leopard would have left much deeper tracks.

94
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:19,152
Okay, I guess I am pretty good.

95
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:21,953
So you'll help me with my case?

96
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,291
Fine. But I'm gonna need some new props.

97
00:07:26,302 --> 00:07:29,250
I'm ready.

98
00:07:29,263 --> 00:07:31,084
What?

99
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:03,713
This is the crime scene.

100
00:08:07,465 --> 00:08:11,597
This is the footprint of the killer, Kyoshi.

101
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:17,210
It was at sunset three hundred and seventy years ago today...

102
00:08:17,215 --> 00:08:22,089
...that she emerged from the temple and struck down Chin the Great.

103
00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:28,437
After that tragic day, we built this statue to immortalize our great leader.

104
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:31,858
Feel free to appreciate it.

105
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:42,905
This temple and this statue were cut from the same stone.

106
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,640
And we know that the statue was built after Chin died.

107
00:08:46,646 --> 00:08:49,254
So if they were built at the same time, that means...

108
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:55,821
Shhh! I wanna solve it! That means Kyoshi never set foot in this temple.

109
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:58,235
That's a big hole in the mayor's story, but...

110
00:08:58,242 --> 00:09:01,018
...it's not enough to prove Aang's innocence.

111
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:03,504
You're right.

112
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:08,363
We need to go to Kyoshi Island.

113
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:11,767
Where'd you get that?

114
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,247
You got a bald head...

115
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:21,129
...some nice tattoos...

116
00:09:22,415 --> 00:09:27,690
You're going to fit in real well around here.

117
00:09:56,584 --> 00:09:58,170
Where's Aangy?

118
00:09:58,177 --> 00:10:01,092
He couldn't be here, Koko.

119
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,774
I wanted to see Aangy...

120
00:10:14,652 --> 00:10:16,835
Oyagi! Aang is in jail.

121
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,570
The town of Chin says he murdered their leader in a past life.

122
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,590
They say it was Kyoshi.

123
00:10:22,602 --> 00:10:26,781
Kyoshi? That's crazy talk! I'll take you to her shrine.

124
00:10:26,785 --> 00:10:31,401
Maybe something there will help you clear her name.

125
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,590
So, uh... what's Suki up to? Is she around?

126
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:40,393
Actually, she and the other warriors left to fight in the war.

127
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,912
You kids had a big impact on Suki.

128
00:10:42,923 --> 00:10:47,236
She said you inspired her and she wanted to help change the world.

129
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,456
Oh, well... that's great.

130
00:10:52,211 --> 00:10:56,097
This temple was converted into a shrine to Kyoshi.

131
00:10:56,104 --> 00:11:02,442
The clerics tell us these relics are still connected to her spirit. That's her kimono.

132
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,194
She had exquisite taste.

133
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:05,352
Please don't touch.

134
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:08,970
These fans... they were her weapons, no?

135
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:12,148
Also refrain from touching the fans.

136
00:11:12,153 --> 00:11:16,438
These were her boots? Her feet must have been enormous!

137
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:19,720
The biggest of any Avatar.

138
00:11:19,727 --> 00:11:22,513
Wait a minute... big feet?

139
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:24,867
Little footprints? There's no way...

140
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:31,197
Ahem. Special outfit? Hat and pipe? These things mean anything to you?

141
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,432
You're right. I'm sorry. Please.

142
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:38,908
Aha! There's no way Kyoshi could have made that footprint...

143
00:11:38,912 --> 00:11:42,848
...and therefore there is nothing linking her to the crime scene!

144
00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:45,810
Brilliant, Sokka.

145
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:53,148
This girl you're talking about? She'll come around. You just gotta hang in there.

146
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:54,259
You think so?

147
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:54,862
Sure!

148
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:55,395
Yeah.

149
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,603
You're a catch.

150
00:11:56,622 --> 00:11:57,980
I don't know...

151
00:11:57,986 --> 00:12:04,354
Hey! You're smart, handsome, funny, not to mention you're the Avatar.

152
00:12:04,363 --> 00:12:05,916
You guys are great.

153
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:10,645
Don't be afraid to tell her how you feel.

154
00:12:12,228 --> 00:12:15,887
This piece is called "The Birth of Kyoshi."

155
00:12:15,894 --> 00:12:19,789
It was painted at sunrise on the day this island was founded.

156
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:25,296
Why, it was today, in fact, three hundred and seventy years ago.

157
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:28,929
Three hundred and seventy years... wait, are you sure it was today?

158
00:12:28,936 --> 00:12:33,630
Oh, seeing how it's Kyoshi Day, yes, I'm sure.

159
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,271
This ceremony didn't take place at sunrise,...

160
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,154
...it took place at sunset. Look at the shadows.

161
00:12:40,163 --> 00:12:43,776
They point east. So the sun must have been in the west.

162
00:12:43,787 --> 00:12:45,297
So what?

163
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,563
If Kyoshi was in the ceremony at sunset,...

164
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:55,026
...she couldn't have been in Chin committing the crime. She has an alibi!

165
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:58,767
Honorable mayor, we've prepared a solid defense for the Avatar.

166
00:12:58,776 --> 00:13:02,381
We did an investigation and found some very strong evidence.

167
00:13:02,386 --> 00:13:06,560
Evidence? Hmph! That's not how our court system works.

168
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,082
Then how can I prove my innocence?

169
00:13:09,098 --> 00:13:12,366
Simple. I say what happened and then you say what happened...

170
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:16,869
...and then I decide the who's right.

171
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:22,935
That's why we call it justice. Because it's "just us."

172
00:13:28,034 --> 00:13:32,530
Everyone loved Chin the Great because he was so great.

173
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:38,118
Then the Avatar showed up and killed him! And that's how it happened.

174
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:43,635
The accused will now present its argument.

175
00:13:43,647 --> 00:13:46,512
You can do it, Aang. Just remember the evidence.

176
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:51,514
Right... evidence. Ladies and gentlemen,...

177
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,058
...I'm about to tell you what really happened.

178
00:13:54,068 --> 00:14:01,180
And I will prove it with facts. Fact number one... Uh...

179
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:02,980
The footprints!

180
00:14:02,988 --> 00:14:09,387
Oh, yeah... You see, I have very large feet.

181
00:14:10,228 --> 00:14:16,187
Furthermore, your... temple matches your statue.

182
00:14:17,195 --> 00:14:21,321
But... I was in a painting at sunset.

183
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:25,139
So there you have it! I'm not guilty!

184
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:28,960
He's dead.

185
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:34,842
Looks like you did some serious shopping. But where did you get the money?

186
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,790
Do you like your new teapot?

187
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,491
To be honest with you, the best tea tastes delicious...

188
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:45,509
...whether it comes in a porcelain pot or a tin cup.

189
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:48,975
I know we've had some difficult times lately.

190
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,350
We've had to struggle just to get by.

191
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:58,445
But it's nothing to be ashamed of. There is a simple honor in poverty.

192
00:14:58,454 --> 00:15:01,044
There's no honor for me without the Avatar.

193
00:15:01,057 --> 00:15:06,508
Zuko... Even if you did capture the Avatar,...

194
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,781
...I'm not so sure it would solve our problems. Not now.

195
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:13,555
Then there is no hope at all.

196
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:17,634
No, Zuko! You must never give in to despair.

197
00:15:17,643 --> 00:15:24,265
Allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts.

198
00:15:24,281 --> 00:15:30,066
In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself.

199
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:34,917
That is the meaning of inner strength.

200
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:47,570
Mayor Tong, I'd like for the court to hear one last testimony.

201
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:54,000
I've already told you! It's just me and the accused. You can't call any witnesses.

202
00:15:54,009 --> 00:16:01,981
This isn't just any witness. I'm going to call... Avatar Kyoshi herself!

203
00:16:09,712 --> 00:16:11,035
What are you doing?

204
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:16,480
Well, she is Aang's past life. Maybe wearing her stuff will trigger something.

205
00:16:16,495 --> 00:16:19,874
I do believe in the power of stuff.

206
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,317
This is a mockery of Chin law!

207
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:28,105
Please! If you could just wait one more second, I'm sure Kyoshi will be here.

208
00:16:29,277 --> 00:16:32,874
Hey, everybody. Avatar Kyoshi here.

209
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:42,946
This is ridiculous. For the murder of Chin the Great, this court finds the Avatar...

210
00:16:51,152 --> 00:16:54,452
I killed Chin the Conqueror.

211
00:16:55,678 --> 00:17:01,913
A horrible tyrant, Chin was expanding his army to all corners of the continent.

212
00:17:01,918 --> 00:17:04,853
When they came to the neck of the peninsula where we lived,...

213
00:17:04,864 --> 00:17:07,699
...he demanded our immediate surrender.

214
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:12,403
I warned him that I would not sit passively and while he took our home,...

215
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:15,624
...but he did not back down.

216
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:27,176
On that day, we split from the mainland.

217
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:14,485
I created Kyoshi Island so my people could be safe from invaders.

218
00:18:23,444 --> 00:18:26,211
So... what just happened?

219
00:18:26,229 --> 00:18:30,555
Uhh... you kind of confessed. Sorry.

220
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:38,743
And I find you guilty! Bring out the wheel of punishment!

221
00:18:44,449 --> 00:18:47,590
Uncle, I thought a lot about what you said.

222
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,016
You did? Good, good.

223
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:51,672
It's helped me realize something.

224
00:18:51,675 --> 00:18:55,996
We no longer have anything to gain by traveling together.

225
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,367
I need to find my own way.

226
00:19:05,265 --> 00:19:07,275
Wait!

227
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:29,351
The accused will now spin the wheel of punishment to determine his sentence.

228
00:19:29,631 --> 00:19:33,617
I said I would face justice, so I will.

229
00:19:38,222 --> 00:19:40,230
Come on, torture machine!

230
00:19:40,237 --> 00:19:42,268
Eaten by bears!

231
00:19:42,277 --> 00:19:43,259
Razor pit!

232
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:48,008
Community service! Please stop on community service.

233
00:19:51,996 --> 00:19:57,673
Looks like it's "boiled in oil."

234
00:20:06,592 --> 00:20:10,631
We've come to claim this village for the Fire Lord!

235
00:20:10,652 --> 00:20:14,869
Now show me your leader so I may...

236
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,148
...dethrone him.

237
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:20,991
That's him over there!

238
00:20:20,996 --> 00:20:23,915
You! Avatar! Do something!

239
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:29,200
Gee, I'd love to help, but I'm supposed to be boiled in oil.

240
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:36,669
There! "Community service." Now serve our community and get rid of those rhinos!

241
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:59,133
Rough Rhinos, to the town!

242
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,062
Boomerang! You do always come back!

243
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:28,501
From now on, we'll celebrate a new Avatar Day in honor of the day Avatar Aang...

244
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,795
...saved us from the Rough Rhino Invasion.

245
00:22:31,805 --> 00:22:33,299
What is this?

246
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:38,130
That's our new festival food, unfried dough.

247
00:22:38,165 --> 00:22:47,889
May we eat it and be reminded of how on this day the Avatar was not boiled in oil.

248
00:22:53,097 --> 00:22:56,739
Happy Avatar Day, everyone.

249
00:22:59,805 --> 00:23:04,232
This is by far the worst town we've ever been to.

250
00:23:05,222 --> 00:23:07,617
