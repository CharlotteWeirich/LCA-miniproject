00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:22,461

The Legend of Korra

8
00:00:28,922 --> 00:00:31,711
Although the Hundred Year War has long passed,

9
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:34,007
we are not living in a time of peace.

10
00:00:34,138 --> 00:00:37,603
These revolutionaries who call themselves "Equalists"

11
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:40,181
are not interested in equality at all.

12
00:00:40,882 --> 00:00:44,118
They just want to wage war against benders.

13
00:00:44,218 --> 00:00:47,333
Chief Beifong was supposed to protect Republic City,

14
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:50,777
but she was powerless to stop
Amon's attack on the arena.

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,723
She has failed us all.

16
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:55,766
If we are to survive these dire times,

17
00:00:55,766 --> 00:01:00,229
our law enforcement needs new leadership.

18
00:01:01,706 --> 00:01:04,888
Book one
Chapter Seven : The Aftermath

19
00:01:14,122 --> 00:01:16,749
I still can't believe they're
shutting this place down.

20
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:19,741
Yeah. We had some good
memories here, didn't we?

21
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:23,318
Guys! Great news. You don't
have to go back on the streets.

22
00:01:23,603 --> 00:01:25,861
I talked to Tenzin and made
all the arrangements.

23
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:28,185
You can come live on Air
Temple island with me!

24
00:01:28,185 --> 00:01:30,974
Oh, we'd love to, but...

25
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:34,561
Asami already invited us to
live in her dad's giant mansion!

26
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:39,584
From here on out, it's gonna
be the lap of luxury for us.

27
00:01:39,677 --> 00:01:43,504
Hey Korra, I was hoping
you would stop by.

28
00:01:43,508 --> 00:01:45,031
I was just leaving.

29
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:49,268
So, I guess I'll see you
guys around, some time.

30
00:01:49,268 --> 00:01:52,003
Why not tomorrow? I'd love to
have you come visit the estate.

31
00:01:52,003 --> 00:01:55,408
I don't know, I have some ...
Avatar stuff to do.

32
00:01:55,408 --> 00:02:01,456
Come on Korra.We all deserve a little rest
and relaxation after all this craziness.

33
00:02:01,456 --> 00:02:03,411
We could swim in Asami's pool.

34
00:02:03,436 --> 00:02:04,390
It'll be fun!

35
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:07,590
All right Pabu.

36
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:10,416
Great, we'll see you tomorrow.

37
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,745
Looks like our intel was good.

38
00:02:33,745 --> 00:02:38,068
There's enough evidence here to
bury Cabbage Corp for an eternity.

39
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:51,658
This is an outrage! I'm innocent!

40
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:53,668
Yeah, yeah. That's what they all say...

41
00:02:53,668 --> 00:02:57,080
Is it true that Cabbage Corp is
conspiring with the Equalists?

44
00:03:06,915 --> 00:03:10,849
No! Not my Cabbage Corp!

45
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,717
Hey, Korra.

46
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,875
Tahno?

47
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:29,292
Listen, I know we're not
exactly best friends,

48
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,614
but I'm sorry Amon took your bending.

49
00:03:31,614 --> 00:03:34,261
I've been to the best healers in the city.

50
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:37,872
Whatever Amon did to me, it's permanent.

51
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:43,159
You gotta get him for me.

52
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:49,085
Mr. Sato, if you remember anything else
about what you saw during Amon's attack,

53
00:03:49,085 --> 00:03:50,604
be sure to let us know.

54
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:52,531
I'm happy to help any way I can.

55
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:55,606
I want these Equalists to pay for what they've done.

56
00:03:57,817 --> 00:03:59,894
We're ready for you now.

57
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,896
See you around... Avatar.

58
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:24,723
Earth bending bomb!

59
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:29,204
Avatar Korra ... has arrived.

60
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:33,199
Hey Korra! Glad you made it!
Welcome to paradise!

61
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,135
Looks like you guys settled right in.

62
00:04:36,135 --> 00:04:40,369
Pretty much, except someone forgot to
ask her father if we could stay here.

63
00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:46,033
Yeah, but I smoothed it over with him. It's
easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.

64
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:49,840
This is the greatest place in the world!
Watch this, watch this.

65
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,595
Fetch me my towel, good sir.

66
00:04:51,695 --> 00:04:54,428
Yes, Master ... Bolin.

67
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:58,177
Master Bolin! Ha, I love this guy.

68
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,281
Now pat me dry.

69
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:00,597
As you wish.

70
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,701
Don't forget Master Pabu.

71
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:06,659
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.

72
00:05:13,805 --> 00:05:16,474
So, what do you have
planned for us today.

73
00:05:16,474 --> 00:05:19,459
Let me guess, shopping, makeovers...

74
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:22,716
Ouh, Ouh. I want makeovers!

75
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:26,304
I have something a little
more exciting in mind.

76
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:36,149
Pretty cool, huh?

77
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:38,348
Way cooler than a makeover.

78
00:05:38,348 --> 00:05:41,512
This is where Future Industries test-drives
their Satomobiles.

79
00:05:42,112 --> 00:05:43,245
Ever been behind the wheel?

80
00:05:43,245 --> 00:05:45,889
The only thing I know how to
drive is a polar bear dog.

81
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:47,863
You want me to take you for a spin?

82
00:05:47,863 --> 00:05:48,839
Let's do it!

83
00:06:50,884 --> 00:06:54,183
That was amazing! I didn't
think we'd make it.

84
00:06:54,183 --> 00:06:56,903
Well, you can't be afraid
to mix it up some times.

85
00:06:56,903 --> 00:07:01,410
I gotta admit, I had you pegged wrong.
I thought you were kind of... prissy.

86
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,026
Eh-No offense!

87
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:07,273
It's alright, people usually assume
that I'm daddy's helpless little girl,

88
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:09,116
but I can handle myself.

89
00:07:09,116 --> 00:07:11,970
I mean, I've been in self-defense
classes since I was this high.

90
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,631
My dad made sure that I would
always be able to protect myself.

91
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:16,197
Smart guy.

92
00:07:16,808 --> 00:07:19,914
Emergency, emergency
coming through, beep beep!

93
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,415
Is there another bathroom I can use?

94
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:27,785
We have a lady's powder room upstairs, first door
on your right. You can freshen up in there.

95
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:28,781
Thanks.

96
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,819
No, no! No, I assure you, everything
is going exactly as planned.

97
00:07:55,929 --> 00:08:01,476
Yes... Luckily, the Cabbage Corp
investigation has bought us enough time.

98
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:06,895
Trust me, by the end of the week...
we'll be ready to strike!

99
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,104
You're leaving? But I-I thought...

100
00:08:16,865 --> 00:08:20,757
Uh, sorry! I forgot, I'm supposed
to airsit, I mean babybend,

101
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:23,810
I-I mean babysit the air bender kids.
See you later!

102
00:08:29,682 --> 00:08:35,282
So, you think Mr. Sato manufactured those gloves
for the Equalists, then framed Cabbage Corp?

103
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:38,276
That's a bold accusation,
but what proof do you have?

104
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:42,100
Well, I don't exactly have proof but I know
what I heard.

105
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,493
Sato's up to something.

106
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:45,755
He does have the means...

107
00:08:45,855 --> 00:08:47,249
and he has a motive.

108
00:08:47,349 --> 00:08:48,200
That's right.

109
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,240
A motive? What is it?

110
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,535
Twelve years ago, the Agni Kai
Triad robbed Sato's mansion.

111
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,476
A Firebender killed Sato's
wife during the break in.

112
00:08:57,576 --> 00:08:58,525
That's terrible.

113
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:04,109
It was tragic. It's possible he's been
harboring anti-bending sentiment all this time.

114
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:07,708
Maybe we should look at Mr. Sato
a little more closely.

115
00:09:17,317 --> 00:09:20,871
What's going on? Why are they
asking Hiroshi more questions?

116
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:23,072
I overheard him on
the phone yesterday.

117
00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:28,348
Asami, I don't know how to tell you this, but I think
your father might be involved with the Equalists.

118
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:31,038
What? I don't believe this.

119
00:09:31,886 --> 00:09:35,362
You spied on Hiroshi?
What's your problem?

120
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:41,084
Mr. Sato, we just have a few
follow-up question for you.

121
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:42,947
My father is innocent.

122
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:47,487
Just because we're not benders doesn't
mean we support those awful Equalists.

123
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,584
Equalists!? Is that
what this is about?

124
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:53,592
I can assure you I have nothing
to do with those radicals.

125
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:55,791
You don't know what you're
talking about, Korra.

126
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,398
I overheard you on the phone.

127
00:09:57,398 --> 00:10:01,956
You said the Cabbage Corp investigation bought
you time, and you're getting ready to strike.

128
00:10:01,956 --> 00:10:03,136
Explain that.

129
00:10:05,196 --> 00:10:07,534
This is all just a
misunderstanding,

130
00:10:07,534 --> 00:10:11,381
resulting from the young
Avatar's overactive imagination.

131
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:14,670
My number one competitor was
knocked out of the game,

132
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,650
it's providing me an opportunity to strike
the market with a new line of Satomobiles.

133
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,981
It's just business. Nothing nefarious.

134
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:27,178
In order to put all
suspicions to rest,

135
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,660
might we have a look into your
factories and warehouses.

136
00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:35,928
If you feel it's necessary you're welcome
to search all of Future Industries.

137
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:43,550
Is it possible, the presidents of Cabbage Corp
and Future Industries both have Equalist ties,

138
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:48,152
or did Hiroshi Sato frame his
long time rival, Lau Gan-Lan.

139
00:10:48,152 --> 00:10:52,218
Or did chief Beifong just
plain arrest the wrong man,

140
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:57,531
so far the investigation has yielded
no evidence to incriminate Sato.

141
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:05,774
I can't believe, we
didn't find anything.

142
00:11:05,774 --> 00:11:08,120
It would appear Hiroshi is innocent.

143
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:11,805
Ok you did your search,
now you can all leave.

144
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,426
So, I hope you're convinced now.

145
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:23,316
No, I'm not. I don't care how cooperative
Hiroshi has been, I know he's lying.

146
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,162
Why are you doing this?

147
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:27,247
Are you that jealous of me and Asami?

148
00:11:27,247 --> 00:11:30,325
What? Don't be ridiculous, that
has nothing to do with it.

149
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:33,587
If you don't drop this,
consider our friendship over.

150
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:38,159
I'm sorry, Hiroshi is not
the man you think he is.

151
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,301
I think you guys
should hear this.

152
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:13,052
If you want to find the truth, meet me under
the North end of Silk Road bridge at midnight.

153
00:12:21,546 --> 00:12:23,734
Psst. Over here.

154
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:30,385
Listen I joined the Equalists
because I believed in what Amon said,

155
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:33,081
I thought he could make life
better for us, non-benders,

156
00:12:33,081 --> 00:12:35,656
but I didn't sign up
for this, this war.

157
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,443
What do you have on Hiroshi Sato?

158
00:12:37,543 --> 00:12:40,619
He manufactured those gloves for the Equalists.

159
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:41,782
I knew it!

160
00:12:41,782 --> 00:12:46,236
And there are rumor he's working on something
even bigger, some new kind of weapon.

161
00:12:46,236 --> 00:12:49,140
We searched all of Future
Industries and found nothing.

162
00:12:49,216 --> 00:12:51,475
That's because he has a secret factory.

163
00:12:51,593 --> 00:12:52,404
Where?

164
00:12:52,516 --> 00:12:55,166
It's right underneath
the Sato mansion.

165
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,072
Raiding the Sato mansion is a risky move
with Tarrlok breathing down your neck.

166
00:13:11,387 --> 00:13:13,532
- If we're wrong... 
- I know, I can kiss my job good bye,

167
00:13:15,614 --> 00:13:18,724
but protecting Republic
City is all I care about.

168
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:21,864
We can't let Amon get his hands on this new weapon.

169
00:13:31,585 --> 00:13:33,108
What are you doing here?

170
00:13:33,337 --> 00:13:36,723
We have reason to believe there's a
factory hidden below the mansion.

171
00:13:36,723 --> 00:13:40,502
I think I would have noticed if there
was a factory underneath my house.

172
00:13:40,502 --> 00:13:43,922
The lies you people come up with
just to persecute my father.

173
00:13:43,922 --> 00:13:45,133
Where's your father?

174
00:13:45,193 --> 00:13:47,880
In his workshop
behind the house.

175
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,505
Dad? Hello?

176
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:07,288
Chief, the estate's been secured. No one
has left the workshop since we arrived.

177
00:14:07,376 --> 00:14:10,034
Perhaps we just couldn't
see him leaving.

178
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:24,201
There's a tunnel beneath the workshop
running deep into the mountain side.

179
00:14:24,301 --> 00:14:26,421
What? There's no tunnel.

180
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:41,550
Do you think your Dad
knows about this tunnel?

181
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,812
I don't understand, there
must be an explanation.

182
00:14:44,812 --> 00:14:49,650
Maybe you don't know everything
about your father. I'm sorry.

183
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,306
Officers, into the tunnel, be cautious.

184
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:59,619
You three, stay up here. Officer
Song keep an eye on them.

185
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:40,072
Not your average backyard workshop.

186
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:46,300
And I'm guessing those are the new weapons.

187
00:15:55,398 --> 00:15:58,126
Hiroshi was lying alright,
but where is he?

188
00:16:01,646 --> 00:16:04,835
What was that? We need to get down
there and see what's going on.

189
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:08,049
Absolutely not, you're staying
put until the chief comes back.

190
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:13,582
Alright, we'll stay put, but can
we wait outside or something?

191
00:16:13,582 --> 00:16:15,181
It's so dusty in this workshop.

192
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:17,223
No! We're waiting right here.

193
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:19,951
Ok, but don't blame me if I start...

194
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:24,643
if I start snee...snee...snee...

195
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,963
What's your problem bud?

196
00:16:25,963 --> 00:16:27,358
I'm about to...

197
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:37,166
Sorry pal, we now you're
just doing your job.

198
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,133
Yeah, just stay put until
the chief comes back.

199
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,896
That sounds very familiar, doesn't it?
Why? Because you said it.

200
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:46,711
Asami, you should stay
here, we'll check it out.

201
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:48,788
I have to find out the
truth about my father.

202
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:52,771
I understand, that's why I'm
going down to find out for you.

203
00:16:52,797 --> 00:16:54,235
Please.

204
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,027
Alright.

205
00:17:00,422 --> 00:17:01,945
Be careful.

206
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:11,532
I'm afraid, you won't be able to
metal bend that wall chief Beifong.

207
00:17:11,553 --> 00:17:12,872
It's solid platinum.

208
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,817
My mecha tanks are platinum as well.

209
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:24,087
Not even your renowned mother could
bend a metal so pure.

210
00:17:24,187 --> 00:17:28,215
Hiroshi, I knew you were a
lying-no-good Equalist.

211
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:29,619
Come out here and...

212
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:33,303
And do what, young Avatar?
Face the wrath of your bending?

213
00:17:33,493 --> 00:17:40,327
No. I think I'll fight from inside
here, where my odds are a little more "equal".

214
00:17:40,629 --> 00:17:43,653
That source was a setup,
you lured us down here.

215
00:17:43,753 --> 00:17:45,723
Guilty as charged.

216
00:18:54,322 --> 00:18:55,637
Korra!

217
00:19:32,624 --> 00:19:36,370
Well, I'd say that was a
near flawless test run.

218
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,747
Load everyone into the transport
and deliver them to Amon.

219
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:51,386
Oh no!

220
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:57,158
Korra was right. We gotta
do something. Quick.

221
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:14,306
Not so fast, boys.

222
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:19,769
Hello Mr.Sato. Wow!

223
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:24,538
What a really swell scary factory, you
have here under your giant mansion.

224
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:30,487
Sponsoring our team, supporting the
Avatar, it was all just a big cover.

225
00:20:30,634 --> 00:20:33,640
Yes and the most difficult part,

226
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:39,641
was watching my daughter traipse around
with a firebending street rat like you!

227
00:20:43,835 --> 00:20:45,341
Dad, stop!

228
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:49,273
Why?

229
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,419
Sweetie...

230
00:20:52,198 --> 00:20:55,164
I wanted to keep you out of
this for as long as I could,

231
00:20:55,164 --> 00:20:56,635
but now that you
know the truth...

232
00:20:57,575 --> 00:20:59,859
please, forgive me.

233
00:21:00,546 --> 00:21:04,436
These people...these benders...

234
00:21:04,436 --> 00:21:08,308
they took away your mother.
The love of my life.

235
00:21:08,314 --> 00:21:09,925
They ruined the world,

236
00:21:10,276 --> 00:21:14,487
but with Amon we can fix it and
build a perfect world together.

237
00:21:14,938 --> 00:21:17,855
We can help people like us everywhere.

238
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:19,933
Join me, Asami.

239
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:46,284
No.

240
00:21:47,012 --> 00:21:48,383
I love you, Dad.

241
00:21:59,978 --> 00:22:01,065
Let's get out of here!

242
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:23,257
My metal benders are on their way
to Amon and it's all my fault.

243
00:22:23,796 --> 00:22:27,208
Tarrlok's right. I
failed as chief.

244
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,287
First thing in the morning, I'm
handing in my resignation.

245
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,403
No! You can't give up like this.

246
00:22:32,457 --> 00:22:36,899
I'm not giving up, I'm gonna find
my officers and take Amon down.

247
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:38,954
But I'm gonna do it, my way!

248
00:22:38,954 --> 00:22:41,244
Outside the law!

249
00:22:44,174 --> 00:22:45,911
I'm sorry, I didn't believe you,

250
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:49,939
but Asami's dad being an Equalist
is not an easy thing to believe.

251
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:50,862
Even now.

252
00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:54,844
I know, I'm sorry this
whole thing happened.

253
00:22:54,844 --> 00:22:58,248
So does your offer to live at
the Air Temple still stand?

254
00:22:58,348 --> 00:23:01,926
Of course, it does.
And Asami's welcome too.

255
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:05,997
Thank you so much.
After everything she's been through,

256
00:23:06,597 --> 00:23:09,626
she's going to need you Mako.

257
00:23:21,604 --> 00:23:27,810
