00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,680
(Women cheering)

165
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,210
Practically no one.

166
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,450
All in favor of me?

167
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,850
(Men cheering)

168
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,590
Eight to eight.
It's a tie.

169
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,450
We can't trust a woman's math.

170
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,260
Count again.

171
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,460
(All bickering indistinctly)

172
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,700
Greetings, soft ones.

173
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,700
Who among you is your leader?

174
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,300
Men: He is.
Women: She is.

175
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,500
Curious.

176
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,840
You are a diarchic society?

177
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,840
Um... maybe.

178
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,240
Whatever we are,
I'm the leader of it.

179
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,510
Leader? Fat man, you
couldn't even run a bath.

180
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,810
Well, you sure can run
something-- your mouth!

181
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,450
(All bickering indistinctly)

182
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,650
Silence.

183
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,420
Even a young pebble could see

184
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,420
your race is divided
based on the configuration

185
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,520
of your 23rd chromosome.

186
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,520
What?
You mean along gender lines?

187
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,860
Gender?

188
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,260
Yeahs.
You knows guyses, galses,

189
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,430
in that order. Ows.

190
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,200
I am not familiar
with this concept of gender.

191
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,140
My species has only a single
gender, known as neuchacho.

192
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,640
Interesting. Come on, men.
Let's kill him.

193
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,810
(Men murmuring in agreement)

194
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,610
(Men groaning)

195
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,850
Your genders differ
in many ways.

196
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,550
But, as with all things
that are different,

197
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,280
chocolate and vanilla,

198
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,580
Mac and PC,

199
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,650
one is always clearly better.

200
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,520
Chocolate, Mac, men.
The end.

201
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,630
Well, I've got nothing to do for
the next eight million years.

202
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,530
Therefore, I will administer
a series of tests

203
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,260
to determine
the superior gender.

204
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,370
Test number one:
Who can drink the most sulfur?

205
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,570
(Croaking gasps)

206
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,710
Test inconclusive.
Test number two:

207
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,810
Who can drink the most arsenic?

208
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,140
Just ask us some
damn questions.

209
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,480
Very well. Which is larger,

210
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,520
an Italian size four or
an American apparel medium?

211
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,860
How many calories are
in a small green tea yogurt?

212
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,660
Name any 12
of the desperate housewives.

213
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,190
How was your day?

214
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,330
(Women cheering)

215
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,430
Test complete.
What is the score?

216
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,470
Uh... men five, women less.

217
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,970
Hey. He's lying.
Obviously.

218
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,940
That was a test
to see who could lie better.

219
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,570
The men win that round.

220
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,040
(Men cheering)

221
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,380
In your face,
decumbent urinators.

222
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,380
(Bickering indistinctly)

223
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,380
So far, I have learned nothing.

224
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,920
But that's probably
as much my fault as yours.

225
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,460
The time has come
for the final test.

226
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,530
We usually call it
the lightning round.

227
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,130
As you may have noticed,
it's getting hotter here.

228
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,560
(Murmuring)
It's nice.

229
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,960
(Men complaining)
Too hot.

230
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,130
Did one of you chicks
change the thermostat?

231
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,670
Tomorrow morning,
this planet makes

232
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,570
its closest pass to the sun.

233
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,670
You will all be boiled alive,
like retired circus animals

234
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,910
unless you somehow can cross
the great alkali plains

235
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,710
and reach shelter in
the cave of harmony.

236
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,420
That sounds hard.

237
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,720
Whichever gender

238
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,050
reaches the cave will survive.

239
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,490
And may the inferior gender

240
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,690
burst into something.

241
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,820
Flames, I guess.

242
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,640
Uh-oh.

243
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,040
I think we're walking
in circles.

244
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,840
I recognize the pattern
of striations

245
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,410
on that gypsum formation.

246
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,440
Also my shoe that fell off.

247
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,580
Oh, God.
We're all gonna die in agony.

248
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,850
Howdy there.

249
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,880
You fellas need
some directions?

250
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,820
No, we're fine.
Don't worry about it.

251
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,890
(Panting)
Keep it up, sistren.

252
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,360
Only a few more Miles
to the cave.

253
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,030
Let's just buckle down and...

254
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,460
Oh, look!

255
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,030
A clearance sale!

256
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,430
What?! Where?

257
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,470
(Women shouting excitedly)

258
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,400
(Crickets chirping)

259
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,670
Labarbara:
I believe that sale was just a mirage.

260
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,610
Now we're gonna die
without so much

261
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,380
as a factory-second clutch
purse to show for it.

262
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,080
(Sighs)
It would have been nice

263
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,580
to shop at Tommy hilfiger
one last time.

264
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,580
It wasn't Tommy hilfijigger.

265
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,280
It was linens 'n things!

266
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,890
The hell it was.

267
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,690
It was a juicy couture.

268
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,590
I guess we all saw
what we wanted to see.

269
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,690
We can't make it tonight.

270
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,500
We'll set up camp here
by this shoe.

271
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,070
Oh, gentlemen,
when that sun rises

272
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,430
in the morning, we're toast.

273
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,670
These are
our last moments together.

274
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,570
So if one's got
any good fart jokes,

275
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,680
now would be the time.

276
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,910
(Groans)

277
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,480
It's a shmundred degrees,

278
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,380
and all we have to drink
are non-diet sodas.

279
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,650
(All grumbling)

280
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
It's gonna ruin my figure.

281
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,180
It, I forgot

282
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,890
that amana here
is a refrigerator.

283
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,760
If we could supercharge her
freon with a gas compressor,

284
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,460
we might survive the heat
and make to the cave.

285
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,890
Hey, yeah!

286
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,130
But the only gas compressor
on this planet

287
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
is inside bender's ass.

288
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,570
Was that a fart joke?

289
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,300
Because I don't
find those amusing.

290
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,700
No one does.

291
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,900
Nevertheless,
bender's gas blaster

292
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,510
may be our only hope.

293
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,740
(All snoring)

294
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,890
(Gasps)

295
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,390
(Gasps)
Wife?

296
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,760
What are you doing
with bender's

297
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,890
shiny metal gas compressor?

298
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,490
None of your bizmarkie.

299
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,060
Wait a second.

300
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,900
What's that doo-wah
in your ditty bag?

301
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,300
Uh, uh...

302
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,970
Okay, so we were hot.

303
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,900
I stole amana's freon coil

304
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,000
so we could hook it up to
bender's ass and build a cooler.

305
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,340
(Gasps)
You are no better than me,

306
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,240
you shifty tree skink.

307
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,940
How do you live with yourself?

308
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,610
Damn it, woman, you're
making me highly selassie!

309
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,680
Oh, don't you talk
to me that way,

310
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,050
you big, hairy Belafonte.

311
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,650
(Both moaning)

312
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,160
(Snoring)

313
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,300
(Sniffs)

314
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,600
(Sizzling)
Oh, you're cookin me back bacon.

315
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,370
Thank you, woman.

316
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,500
Labarbara (Gasps):
That's not back-bacon!

317
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,470
That's your back bakin'!

318
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,900
Oh no! We overslept!

319
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,310
(Liquid bubbling)

320
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,640
The Mercury river is boiling.

321
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,180
(All coughing)

322
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,810
Can't breathe...

323
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,810
Lungs burning...

324
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,620
(Screaming)

325
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,790
My lucky shoe!

326
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,760
Good-bye cruel me.

327
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,800
(All gasping)

328
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,140
I learned that from a movie.

329
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,140
(All gasping)

330
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,880
(Rumbling)

331
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,820
I find both genders
supremely disappointing.

332
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,090
The real reason I administered
this bizarre, outer space test

333
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,960
was to teach you
to work together.

334
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,690
But you couldn't.

335
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,890
Thanks to you, I lost my
bet with the borax kid.

336
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,500
Never bet against me being stupid.
Enough.

337
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,830
Your gender differences have
kept you from achieving harmony.

338
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,170
There is only one way
to resolve this conflict.

339
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,270
(Yelling)

340
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,480
Wait, why didn't that hurt?

341
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,850
(Shrieks)
My wingwang's gone!

342
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,480
My girls!

343
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,580
My antennae!

344
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,580
My kajigger!

345
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,950
My gonopores!

346
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,450
Look it up.

347
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,760
I have freed you from
the tyranny of gender.

348
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,300
Now go in peace.

349
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,900
Or actually, stay here.

350
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,000
I'll go in peace.

351
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,170
Good news, neuchachos.

352
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,310
The ship is nearly repaired.

353
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,250
Work goes fasters withouts no
secondary sex characteristicses

354
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,180
at which to hoot.

355
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,920
Now who wants to sings
some Christopher cross songs?

356
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,790
(All agreeing)

357
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,690
Look, associates, I made a
hammock from our clothing.

358
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,190
How industrious.

359
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,160
Do you mind if we
sleep with you?

360
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,230
I have no opinion.

361
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,070
Well, good night.

362
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,770
(Snoring)

363
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,770
Hermes:
Everyone got along so well today.

364
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,610
Yes, this place is like
a neutered utopia.

365
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,240
A neutopia.

366
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,680
I enjoy humor where
no one gets hurt.

367
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,750
Your companionship
is inoffensive, Hermes.

368
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,020
Likewise.

369
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,790
Really, what are we missing out on by not
having sex right now?

370
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,920
Well...

371
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,630
Give us back our genitals!

372
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,000
Is that you, borax kid?

373
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,170
I've got your 50 bucks.

374
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,700
Oh, it's you.

375
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,370
Why do you want your genders?

376
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,100
You seem happier without them.

377
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,940
Being human isn't just
about being happy.

378
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,910
It's about loving,
and fighting,

379
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,250
and that rasta mcnasty
we were doing last night.

380
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,750
We want that back.

381
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,180
Very well.

382
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,050
Perhaps it is I
who have learned a lesson--

383
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,190
or something.

384
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,460
Bender:
Now what?

385
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,900
I have decided, after little
thought, to return your genders.

386
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,070
(Yelling)

387
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,570
(Groans)

388
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,810
Not cool, bro!

389
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,710
Our genders are all reversed.

390
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,640
Now I got a whatchacallit
instead of a kajigger,

391
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,180
you stupid whatchacallit!

392
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,610
(Angry yelling)

393
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,280
Okay, stop yelling at me.

394
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,980
It was an innocent mistake.

395
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,020
Allow me to rectify it.

396
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,630
I got your distress call and
came as quickly as I wanted to.

397
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,030
No need to thank me.

398
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,700
What's your problem, homes?

399
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,670
Now we'll be stuck
like this forever!

400
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,770
Chill out, dude.

401
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,940
Well, hello from the neck down.

402
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,070
(Girlish giggle)

403
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,940
Thank you for your patronage.

404
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,640
We know you have a choice
in airlines,

405
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,080
and you made the wrong one.

406
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,210
No refunds.

407
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,320
Aren't we going to cuddle?

408
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,260
Woman, I'm tired.

409
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,960
I'm sorry.

410
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,900
It's just...
I need my sleep.

411
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,330
I gotta get up five times
a night to Xbox.

412
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,930
I understand.

413
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,070
Womanhood also takes
some getting used to.

414
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,740
For example, did you know there
are more than two feelings?

415
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,840
I only need one feeling--
love for you, wifey-man.

416
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,980
Ooh, your manwich!

417
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,220
(Zipper zipping)

418
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,260
No wonder it's such
a mess in there.

419
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,960
These bad boys are hard to aim.

420
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,830
I hate being a man.

421
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,230
I smell bad, my face
is scratchy,

422
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,700
and the food at those
strip clubs is terrible.

423
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,730
Crappin' a.

424
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,770
Still, I'm sure the women are
having an even harder time.

425
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,770
(Laughing)

426
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,310
O.M.G.!

427
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,740
Being chicks is so much fun.

428
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:41,210
Now when I say stupid things,
guys all laugh and buy me stuff.

429
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,110
Ugh. What a skank.

430
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,680
Anyway, planet express
is still facing foreclosure.

431
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,650
There's no way
we can raise enough money

432
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,950
to save this company.

433
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,320
Wait. What about
the girlie calendar?

434
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,860
Fry:
Well, that won't work, remember?

435
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,130
We only have three women
on staff... (Gasps)

436
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,330
"All female employees must
pose nude if requested."

437
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,030
And it is requested.

438
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,400
Let's just hope we can sell

439
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,370
enough of these calendars
by tomorrow.

440
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,370
Professor: <i>We sold enough of those</i>
<i>calendars since yesterday!</i>

441
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,140
(Cheering)

442
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,310
Thank God most of our fans
are huge perverts.

443
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,640
(Rumbling)

444
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,890
(All gasping)

445
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,420
Who are you, stranger?

446
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,320
Well, madam,
folks call me the borax kid.

447
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,160
My friend,

448
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,760
the other rock alien,

449
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,430
died without setting
your genitals to right.

450
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,230
So I reckon it's up to me
to sex you up proper.

451
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,570
All:
Huh?

452
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,840
(Excited chatter)

453
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,310
My girls are back!

454
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,240
Ow!

455
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,710
Yay!

456
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,420
So what did you like better, my
love being a man or a woman?

457
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,120
I don't care what parts I have,

458
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,260
as long as they
interlock with yours.

459
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,390
Ah, marriage.

460
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,130
It combines the contentedness
of being neutered,

461
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,030
with the occasional sex
of being not.

462
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,100
(Steamboat whistle blowing)

463
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,370
Well, I best mosey
on down to the landing.

464
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,400
Sounds like the <i>feldspar queen</i>
is about to set sail.

465
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,670
You folks watch
your genitals now.

466
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,580
(Rumbling)

467
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,280
And that's that.

468
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,519
What I miss?

469
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,590
