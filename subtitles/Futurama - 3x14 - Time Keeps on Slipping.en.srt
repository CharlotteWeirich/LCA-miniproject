1
00:00:07,293 --> 00:00:09,409  X1:204 X2:512 Y1:490 Y2:516
Time Keeps On Slipping

2
00:00:35,173 --> 00:00:36,731  X1:263 X2:452 Y1:061 Y2:087
Go get it, boy.

3
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,769  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:061 Y2:121
How about a romantic ride
in one of those swan boats?

4
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:46,572  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:061 Y2:122
They're dangerous,
but I've mastered them.

5
00:00:46,773 --> 00:00:49,731  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:061 Y2:127
Those aren't swan boats.
They're swans.

6
00:00:49,973 --> 00:00:53,010  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:490 Y2:516
That explains these boat eggs.

7
00:01:19,693 --> 00:01:21,809  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:061 Y2:087
Pitiful ballplayers of Earth...

8
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:27,246  X1:096 X2:618 Y1:061 Y2:122
...I am Ethan "Bubblegum" Tate,
commander of the Harlem Globetrotters.

9
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:33,363  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:061 Y2:126
For generations, your planet has lived
in peace with our home world.

10
00:01:33,573 --> 00:01:35,803  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:061 Y2:084
But now, for no reason...

11
00:01:36,053 --> 00:01:40,968  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:061 Y2:126
...we challenge you to defend
your honor on the basketball court.

12
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:46,201  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:061 Y2:126
Will no one meet our challenge?
Have none of you Earthlings game?

13
00:01:46,413 --> 00:01:50,884  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:061 Y2:126
- What happens if we lose?
- Nothing. There's nothing at stake...

14
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:53,402  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:490 Y2:516
...beyond the shame of defeat.

15
00:01:58,373 --> 00:02:00,762  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:495 Y2:516
This will not stand.

16
00:02:01,373 --> 00:02:04,763  X1:219 X2:495 Y1:061 Y2:127
I'll take you on,
you air-balling bozos.

17
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:10,889  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:061 Y2:126
You, old man? Sweet Clyde,
laugh derisively at him.

18
00:02:13,493 --> 00:02:17,281  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:451 Y2:516
I may be an old man...
In fact, I'm fairly sure I am...

19
00:02:17,493 --> 00:02:20,485  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:450 Y2:516
...but I'll put you
Globetrotters in your place...

20
00:02:20,693 --> 00:02:23,526  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:451 Y2:516
...with my team of mutant
atomic supermen!

21
00:02:27,293 --> 00:02:31,172  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:490 Y2:516
Behold! My mutant atomic supermen.

22
00:02:33,693 --> 00:02:37,208  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:450 Y2:516
- They're only a foot high.
- They're still young.

23
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:39,648  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:490 Y2:516
Mere atomic superboys, really.

24
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:44,449  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:516
We'll speed up their growth with
time particles called Cronotons.

25
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:48,532  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Those destroyed an entire civili...
- Good news, everyone.

26
00:02:48,693 --> 00:02:52,003  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:516
You're off to the Tempest Nebula
to gather Cronotons.

27
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:10,491  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hey, Leela, look at me.

28
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:17,926  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:456 Y2:516
Your face can take a lot of punishment.
Good to know.

29
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:22,684  X1:094 X2:622 Y1:450 Y2:516
There's a lot about my face you don't
know. You and it should get acquainted.

30
00:03:22,893 --> 00:03:26,966  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Cool your jets, hotshot.
- Why won't you go out with me?

31
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:30,529  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:450 Y2:516
- We both know there's something there.
- No, I mean, cool your jets...

32
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:33,890  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:489 Y2:516
...they're melting Bender's face.

33
00:03:38,493 --> 00:03:41,690  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Here you go. Hot off the nebula.
- None too soon.

34
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:47,291  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:451 Y2:516
The Trotters held a news conference
to announce that I was a jive sucker.

35
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:13,448  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:490 Y2:516
Behold! My invincible nuclear mutants.

36
00:04:13,773 --> 00:04:15,331  X1:317 X2:398 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Hi.
- Hello.

37
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:19,725  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:061 Y2:121
Marv Albert here at
Madison Cube Garden...

38
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:23,164  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:451 Y2:516
...where the Globetrotters take on a
squad of atomic supermen...

39
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:28,367  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:061 Y2:126
...in what should be a by-the-numbers
contest with no surprises whatsoever.

40
00:04:30,493 --> 00:04:32,529  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:489 Y2:516
Here's the tip-off. Globetrotter ball.

41
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,322  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:456 Y2:516
Clyde Dixon to Bubblegum Tate.
Drives downcourt...

42
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:38,922  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:490 Y2:516
...and Curly Joe from the rear.

43
00:04:39,173 --> 00:04:42,006  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:456 Y2:516
- That one grabbed his behindus.
- Quiet!

44
00:04:42,213 --> 00:04:44,773  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:456 Y2:516
Who dares laugh at
the Jesters of Dunk?

45
00:04:44,973 --> 00:04:49,489  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:451 Y2:516
We came to terrify and humiliate you,
not tickle your funny bones.

46
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:56,007  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:451 Y2:516
Watch as I embarrass your civilization
by passing the ball to Curly Joe.

47
00:04:56,293 --> 00:05:00,923  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:451 Y2:516
Only to have it remain
in my hands with elastic.

48
00:05:01,973 --> 00:05:03,964  X1:330 X2:386 Y1:495 Y2:516
Boo!

49
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:08,724  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:451 Y2:516
And perhaps this will wipe
the smiles from your faces.

50
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:10,401  X1:256 X2:458 Y1:490 Y2:516
Goose goes up.

51
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:15,171  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:456 Y2:516
Rejected. Agrow-treant
from half court. Yes!

52
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:18,851  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:456 Y2:516
GLOBETROTTERS - 42
SUPERMEN - 45

53
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:21,408  X1:213 X2:501 Y1:490 Y2:516
Supermen lead 45-42.

54
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:25,692  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:456 Y2:516
Aracneon with the steal.
Thorais from downtown.

55
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:31,201  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:455 Y2:516
Yes! He's showing us what a man
with a cannon in his chest can do.

56
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:35,292  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:490 Y2:516
No showboating, you atomic hotdog.

57
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:42,812  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:450 Y2:516
And that's the half, with the Supermen
up 48-42. Surprisingly dull so far.

58
00:05:49,093 --> 00:05:52,085  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:061 Y2:121
The Trotters are down by six.
Reactions?

59
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:57,407  X1:102 X2:612 Y1:061 Y2:126
We planned to trail at the half, thus
deepening Earth's eventual humiliation.

60
00:05:57,573 --> 00:06:00,212  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:061 Y2:126
Also, what game
were the refs watching?

61
00:06:04,293 --> 00:06:09,003  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:454 Y2:516
Curly Joe, easily amused by his own
antics, continues to wreak havoc on...

62
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:11,891  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:451 Y2:516
- What the...?
- What happened?

63
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:13,287  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:495 Y2:516
What was that?

64
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:18,448  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
Did everything just jump around?
Or did my brain just stroke off there?

65
00:06:18,653 --> 00:06:21,884  X1:204 X2:512 Y1:061 Y2:126
Something very strange
has just happened...

66
00:06:22,093 --> 00:06:25,802  X1:113 X2:606 Y1:061 Y2:121
...in this game between space clowns
and atomic monsters.

67
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,572  X1:229 X2:485 Y1:495 Y2:516
Time-out. Time-out.

68
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:40,528  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:450 Y2:516
- What's happening?
- We're lurching forward in time...

69
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:42,923  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:456 Y2:516
...like a needle skipping
on a record.

70
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:45,886  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:455 Y2:516
- What's causing it? Is it my outfit?
- No.

71
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:50,205  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:451 Y2:516
It must have something to do
with those time particles I used.

72
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:53,770  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:456 Y2:516
Time and space are ripping apart
at the seams.

73
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,325  X1:288 X2:427 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Oops.
- Oh, great.

74
00:06:58,573 --> 00:07:02,532  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:456 Y2:516
Now, on top of everything,
we need a new fifth man.

75
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:05,446  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:451 Y2:516
Put me in. I wanna show Leela
my skills.

76
00:07:06,453 --> 00:07:09,206  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Will said skills pay the bills?
- Who cares?

77
00:07:09,373 --> 00:07:14,288  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:516
We're 35 points ahead with two
minutes left. What could possibly...?

78
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:23,412  X1:154 X2:560 Y1:061 Y2:126
Globetrotters win, 244-86.
A dark day for humanity, folks.

79
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:27,327  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:061 Y2:082
We have been beaten in basketball.

80
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:30,331  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:455 Y2:516
- Yeah, that's how we do it.
- How's that?

81
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:33,132  X1:215 X2:499 Y1:451 Y2:516
You are all fools
of the highest caliber.

82
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,405  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:516
I don't know what you did, Fry,
but you screwed up.

83
00:07:36,613 --> 00:07:39,810  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:456 Y2:516
Now all the planets are gonna
crack wise about our mamas.

84
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:45,730  X1:094 X2:622 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I'm glad my fat mama isn't alive.
- Enough about your promiscuous mom...

85
00:07:45,973 --> 00:07:50,330  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:451 Y2:516
...we have bigger problems.
This time disruption is serious.

86
00:07:50,573 --> 00:07:51,801  X1:246 X2:469 Y1:490 Y2:516
Damn right, man.

87
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,801  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516
This chronological wang-dang-doodle
could destroy the matrix of reality.

88
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:59,768  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Tate, what do you know about this?
- Not much yet...

89
00:07:59,973 --> 00:08:04,489  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
...but I am senior lecturer in physics
at Globetrotter U. I'd like to help.

90
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:09,813  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:516
- You're that Bubblegum Tate?
- I sure ain't his grandma. Look here.

91
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:14,046  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:456 Y2:516
We got an excess of Cronotons
in the subatomic interstices.

92
00:08:14,253 --> 00:08:15,925  X1:289 X2:426 Y1:493 Y2:516
Yes, I see.

93
00:08:16,093 --> 00:08:20,928  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:456 Y2:516
Something involving that many big
words could destabilize time itself.

94
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,930  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Is that a problem?
- Indeed.

95
00:08:23,093 --> 00:08:27,211  X1:091 X2:623 Y1:450 Y2:516
At this rate, by Tuesday it'll be
Thursday. By Wednesday it'll be August.

96
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:31,810  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:456 Y2:516
And by Thursday, it will be the end
of existence as we know it.

97
00:08:31,973 --> 00:08:37,889  X1:101 X2:615 Y1:451 Y2:516
I have to ask you to clear out. The
circus needs to set up for tomorrow's...

98

00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:06,849  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:451 Y2:516
We behave normally during the time
skips, but we have no memory of it.

104
00:09:07,053 --> 00:09:10,728  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:451 Y2:516
- You mean we just...
- My, yes. Just like that.

105
00:09:10,973 --> 00:09:13,282  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Any luck, Bubblegum?
- Not yet.

106
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:19,642  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Hope you don't mind if I dribble.
- Not if you grant me the same liberty.

107
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:25,084  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:453 Y2:516
Bubblegum, I'm a huge fan of your
work, both on and off the court.

108
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:29,087  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Can I be a Globetrotter?
- Shut up, turkey.

109
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:34,487  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:451 Y2:516
Bubblegum, look. The background
time radiation is fluctuating wildly.

110
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:38,892  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:489 Y2:516
That sucker's shaking like fine booty.

111
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:45,083  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm no physicist, but I think I know
how to stop the skipping. We'll just...

112
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:48,849  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:450 Y2:516
I don't know how this was
supposed to work.

113
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:52,489  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:516
I hope you find out what's
wrong before we skip my birthd...

114
00:09:52,773 --> 00:09:56,607  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Happy birthday, Amy.
- Hooray, look at all these presents.

115
00:09:56,853 --> 00:10:02,689  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:451 Y2:516
I hope we all have as much fun
tomorrow at my birth... What?

116
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:08,731  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:455 Y2:516
I've set up a time-proof shelter
in the closet.

117
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:11,407  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:455 Y2:516
You're the one I want
to share it with.

118
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:14,252  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:489 Y2:516
Fry, that's so sweet. Let me see.

119
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,291  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:451 Y2:516
How will this protect us
from time jumps?

120
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:26,766  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:516
Because when we're together in here,
baby, time will stand still.

121
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:38,569  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:454 Y2:516
- Zoidberg, can I talk to you about Fry?
- Leela, I would be honored.

122
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:43,290  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:451 Y2:516
- does the worst W.C. Fields
imitation I've ever seen. Zoidberg?

123
00:10:43,493 --> 00:10:46,132  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:490 Y2:516
Sorry, you must have been boring me.

124
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:50,406  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:456 Y2:516
The thing is, Fry is very sweet.
But he's so immature.

125
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:54,043  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:456 Y2:516
I love his boyish charm,
but I hate his childishness.

126
00:10:54,253 --> 00:11:00,601  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:516
So he's not perfect. You don't wanna
end up old and lonely like Zoidberg!

127
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:04,281  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:490 Y2:516
You were saying?

128
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:13,083  X1:094 X2:621 Y1:451 Y2:516
There it is. The Tempest Nebula.
Take a whiff through the Smell-a-Scope.

129
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:18,486  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:450 Y2:516
- What's that funky jazz?
- The odor of pure time leaking.

130
00:11:18,653 --> 00:11:22,407  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:456 Y2:516
When we removed the Cronotons,
it destabilized the nebula...

131
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:25,610  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:451 Y2:516
...causing time skips
throughout the universe.

132
00:11:25,773 --> 00:11:30,449  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Let Bubblegum tell it.
- Pretend these balls are time particles.

133
00:11:30,653 --> 00:11:33,884  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:456 Y2:516
As the nebula bounce-passes
them off us...

134
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:38,843  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:455 Y2:516
...they cause dents, or "time skips."
- You are so smart.

135
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:44,127  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:451 Y2:516
What if we were to move this star
cluster to these algebraic coordinates?

136
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:49,771  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:451 Y2:516
Their gravity may divert the Cronotons
to the empty side of the universe.

137
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:51,332  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:490 Y2:516
But is it possible?

138
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:54,531  X1:201 X2:513 Y1:451 Y2:516
Moving stars requires
a bad-ass gravity pump.

139
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:57,730  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:061 Y2:122
We'd need all the money
on Earth to build...

140
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:06,048  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:450 Y2:516
Here's funding. It better work. We can't
spend all of Earth's money every day.

141
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:09,723  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:061 Y2:126
- How long will it take to build?
- It won't be easy.

142
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:13,329  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:061 Y2:121
A jim-jam this complex might
take months or even...

143
00:12:13,573 --> 00:12:15,882  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:490 Y2:516
There we are. One gravity pump.

144
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:19,130  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:456 Y2:516
Powerful enough to move
the stars themselves.

145
00:12:19,293 --> 00:12:22,888  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:451 Y2:516
Now to begin the arduous task
of attaching it to the ship...

146
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:27,131  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:490 Y2:516
Off you go, apparently.

147
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:37,569  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:456 Y2:516
Easy, Leela. Just finger-roll
that star to the cosmic basket.

148
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:40,008  X1:236 X2:477 Y1:495 Y2:516
Just a few more...

149
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:44,565  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:495 Y2:516
...hundred thousand miles.

150
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:46,445  X1:317 X2:398 Y1:495 Y2:516
There.

151
00:12:49,773 --> 00:12:51,809  X1:231 X2:485 Y1:490 Y2:516
Nothing but nebula.

152
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:55,927  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:489 Y2:516
I think we've stopped the time skips.

153
00:12:56,093 --> 00:12:58,084  X1:242 X2:473 Y1:451 Y2:516
- All right.
- Hooray for Leela.

154
00:12:58,253 --> 00:13:01,768  X1:159 X2:555 Y1:451 Y2:516
What better way to celebrate
than by showing Bubblegum...

155
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:04,242  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:495 Y2:516
...the Globetrotter uniform I made.

156
00:13:04,453 --> 00:13:06,569  X1:283 X2:432 Y1:495 Y2:516
Let me see.

157
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:08,287  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:493 Y2:516
Hello, lawsuit.

158
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:13,613  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:451 Y2:516
I want you to know I think the way
you moved those stars was wonderful.

159
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:15,252  X1:224 X2:491 Y1:490 Y2:516
I got you something.

160
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:20,332  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:451 Y2:516
Moderately priced, non-vintage
champagne? How did you know?

161
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:25,402  X1:112 X2:602 Y1:451 Y2:516
You deserve it. Nobody ever stops to
tell you what a great captain you are.

162
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:27,450  X1:186 X2:528 Y1:495 Y2:516
That is so true and sweet.

163
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:31,851  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:450 Y2:516
You're smart, beautiful, and best
of all, you'll go out with me?

164
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:34,772  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:490 Y2:516
Fry, please try to understand.

165
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:38,204  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:455 Y2:516
You're a man. I'm a woman.
We're too different.

166
00:13:38,373 --> 00:13:42,889  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:456 Y2:516
Bubblegum might let me organize a bake
sale for the Globetrotter wives.

167
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:48,127  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Can you teach me to make cupcakes?
- All right. I want to lick the beaters.

168
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,882  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:451 Y2:516
I got her champagne.
What does a guy have to do?

169
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:54,124  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:490 Y2:516
Eighty-six the chump stuff.

170
00:13:54,373 --> 00:14:00,289  X1:104 X2:610 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's time to win Leela's heart with
a showy, three-point romantic gesture.

171
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:05,089  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:451 Y2:516
Maybe this is the moment
to show her my real surprise.

172
00:14:08,053 --> 00:14:13,127  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Fry, what are you doing?
- Time to boogie on down to the sauna.

173
00:14:13,493 --> 00:14:16,690  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:516
I've been studying how to pilot.
Impressed?

174
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:19,606  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:489 Y2:516
Yeah, actually. You're doing okay.

175
00:14:19,773 --> 00:14:22,571  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:456 Y2:516
The reactor temperature is nominal.
The blinker's off.

176
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:26,123  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:456 Y2:516
I learned to work the gravity pump too,
in case we need it.

177
00:14:26,373 --> 00:14:30,286  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:456 Y2:516
- So are we dating now?
- Is that what this is all about?

178
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,091  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:493 Y2:516
Please, cut it out now.

179
00:14:32,293 --> 00:14:36,730  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:516
I know there's some perfect thing
I can do to make you love me.

180
00:14:36,973 --> 00:14:40,682  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:451 Y2:516
- When I figure out what it is...
- I don't wanna hurt you...

181
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:46,087  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:451 Y2:516
...but there is absolutely, positively
no way that you and I will ever...

182
00:14:46,373 --> 00:14:51,083  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:451 Y2:516
- man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

183
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:02,091  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:495 Y2:516
He looks radiant.

184
00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:07,486  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:451 Y2:516
Bubblegum, we failed.
The time skips haven't stopped.

185
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:10,924  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:061 Y2:121
Even in these formal shorts,
I feel like a failure.

186
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:13,408  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
You tricked me into marrying you,
didn't you?

187
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:14,562  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:495 Y2:516
Of course not.

188
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:19,324  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:516
- How'd you do it? Drugs? Hypnosis?
- No, drugs are for losers.

189
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:22,291  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:451 Y2:516
And hypnosis is for losers
with big eyebrows.

190
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:27,521  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:516
I don't know what I did to make
you love me. But we're married now.

191
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:31,408  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:455 Y2:516
- We've got the rest of our lives...
- The divorce is final.

192
00:15:31,653 --> 00:15:33,928  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:451 Y2:516
- What?
- Let's divide up the china.

193
00:15:34,173 --> 00:15:38,212  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'll take the NFC helmets,
and you can have the AFC.

194
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:40,722  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:490 Y2:516
Fine. Break my heart again.

195
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:45,092  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:450 Y2:516
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You lost the woman of your dreams...

196
00:15:45,253 --> 00:15:49,371  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:451 Y2:516
...but you still have Zoidberg.
You all still have Zoidberg.

197
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:54,010  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:451 Y2:516
How did I get Leela to love me?
I've got to figure it out.

198
00:15:54,213 --> 00:15:58,172  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Maybe you're just a fantastic lover.
- I don't know what I'm doing.

199
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:01,331  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:455 Y2:516
Maybe she'd come back if
I were a Globetrotter.

200
00:16:01,573 --> 00:16:04,724  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:454 Y2:516
- What do you say, Bubblegum?
- Hell, no.

201
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:09,085  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's hopeless. I did something
so great it won Leela's heart...

202
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:14,208  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:516
...and I'll never, ever know
what it was. My life is empty.

203
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:16,762  X1:297 X2:418 Y1:490 Y2:516
Zoidberg.

204
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:22,804  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:451 Y2:516
No wonder we failed. Diverting
Cronotons is mathematically impossible.

205
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:26,852  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:451 Y2:516
I knew I should have checked
your showboating algebra.

206
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,886  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:456 Y2:516
I thought you knew that algebra
was all razzmatazz.

207
00:16:30,093 --> 00:16:34,689  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:451 Y2:516
A Globetrotter always saves the good
algebra for the final minutes.

208
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:36,252  X1:228 X2:486 Y1:490 Y2:516
Vintage Bubblegum.

209
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:42,210  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:451 Y2:516
The time skips are worse. Isolated
spots are jumping by years. Look.

210
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:44,171  X1:214 X2:500 Y1:490 Y2:516
Stupid senior citizens!

211
00:16:44,373 --> 00:16:49,572  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:451 Y2:516
Why should we pay for their benefits?
I deserve free money!

212
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:55,723  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:455 Y2:516
I'm stumped. We'll have to call in the
finest scientific minds in the univer...

213
00:16:55,973 --> 00:17:00,728  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:451 Y2:516
We could explode the whole nebula.
What do you think, Curly Joe?

214
00:17:00,893 --> 00:17:05,967  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:456 Y2:516
An explosion big enough to destroy that
mama would take out half the universe.

215
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:11,167  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:451 Y2:516
You got to Globetrotter that explosion
up a little. Make it an implosion.

216
00:17:11,373 --> 00:17:13,523  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:490 Y2:516
By God, Sweet Clyde is right.

217
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:18,892  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516
An implosion might form a black hole
that'd stop Cronotons from escaping.

218
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:21,926  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:451 Y2:516
Whoa, slow that
brain train down, prof.

219
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:25,290  X1:217 X2:498 Y1:450 Y2:516
We'd need some kind
of doomsday device.

220
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:31,529  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:456 Y2:516
Doomsday device?
Now the ball's in Farnsworth's court.

221
00:17:34,573 --> 00:17:37,724  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:456 Y2:516
I suppose I could part with one
and still be feared.

222
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,761  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:450 Y2:516
Give me some skin, prof. I'm making
you an honorary Globetrotter.

223
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:45,443  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:450 Y2:516
In fact, everybody in this room's
an honorary Globetrotter.

224
00:17:45,813 --> 00:17:48,486  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:494 Y2:516
I'm a Globetrotter!

225
00:17:49,173 --> 00:17:51,243  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Did you say...?
- Too late, hot plate.

226
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:52,772  X1:324 X2:391 Y1:490 Y2:516
Crap!

227
00:17:57,853 --> 00:18:04,088  X1:100 X2:614 Y1:451 Y2:516
We must leave now, for we are needed
elsewhere. But we wish you Godspeed.

228
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:10,282  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:451 Y2:516
Please. Please let me come with you.
I can make myself taller.

229
00:18:10,693 --> 00:18:13,491  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:456 Y2:516
You can talk trash.
You can handle the ball.

230
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:18,403  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:451 Y2:516
But ask yourself, are you funky
enough to be a Globetrotter?

231
00:18:18,653 --> 00:18:20,530  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Are you?
- Yes.

232
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:24,408  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Are you?
- I mean, with time my funk level...

233
00:18:24,613 --> 00:18:27,002  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Are you?
- No.

234
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:29,450  X1:280 X2:436 Y1:495 Y2:516
Deal with it.

235
00:18:46,373 --> 00:18:49,524  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Careful with that doomsday device.
- What does it matter?

236
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,649  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:494 Y2:516
I'll never be a Globetrotter.

237
00:18:51,813 --> 00:18:55,647  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:451 Y2:516
My life, and, by extension,
everyone else's, is meaningless.

238
00:18:55,813 --> 00:18:57,292  X1:315 X2:398 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>Roger.</i>

239
00:18:57,453 --> 00:19:01,287  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:516
Leela, I don't know what
I did to make you love me.

240
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:04,490  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:516
I don't think I tricked you,
but maybe I did.

241
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:08,328  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:450 Y2:516
- And if I did, I'm sorry.
- It's okay, Fry.

242
00:19:08,573 --> 00:19:11,531  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:455 Y2:516
- You know we'll always be friends.
- Yeah.

243
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:16,324  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:516
I don't guess anything I do will make
you feel for me the way I feel for you.

244
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:19,093  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:490 Y2:516
I guess not.

245
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:24,289  X1:156 X2:558 Y1:490 Y2:516
The doomsday device is ready.

246
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:29,806  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:451 Y2:516
Maybe blasting this space into a storm
of nothingness will cheer me up.

247
00:19:30,053 --> 00:19:34,490  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:451 Y2:516
Okay, let me just take
the ship out to a safe distance.

248
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:38,803  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:450 Y2:516
Actually, I think I'll go
and prep the detonator.

249
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,408  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:489 Y2:516
Fry, why don't you take the helm.

250
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:47,132  X1:259 X2:456 Y1:489 Y2:516
She's so great.

251
00:19:47,373 --> 00:19:51,286  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:456 Y2:516
I almost remember the thing
I did to make her love me.

252
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:53,012  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:495 Y2:516
But I never will.

253
00:19:53,253 --> 00:19:59,567  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:455 Y2:516
Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like
to have a dream I'll never achieve.

254
00:20:20,813 --> 00:20:25,125  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:455 Y2:516
That's how I did it. I moved
the stars to write her a love note.

255
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:31,329  X1:156 X2:558 Y1:456 Y2:516
<i>- Detonation in three, two, one.</i>
- No!

256
00:20:41,293 --> 00:20:43,045  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:490 Y2:516
Did you see it?

257
00:20:43,253 --> 00:20:45,892  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:451 Y2:516
- The explosion?
- No, not the explosion.

258
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:48,482  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:495 Y2:516
Then what?

259
00:20:48,973 --> 00:20:50,691  X1:304 X2:411 Y1:490 Y2:516
Nothing.

0
