1
00:00:00,649 --> 00:00:03,021
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:03,022 --> 00:00:04,895
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:04,896 --> 00:00:07,004
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:08,296
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:13,496
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:17,575
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:21,888
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:25,048
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:29,210
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:31,050
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:36,989
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,612
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:48,195
Previously on "Avatar"...

15
00:00:48,459 --> 00:00:51,762
We need to find King Bumi so Aang can learn earthbending somewhere safe.

16
00:00:51,779 --> 00:00:54,123
Sounds like you're headed to Omashu.

17
00:00:54,135 --> 00:00:59,578
I present to you the Earth Kingdom city of O... Oh, no...

18
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,280
I guess I need to find someone else to teach me earthbending.

19
00:01:02,293 --> 00:01:07,323
You need to find someone who waits and listens before striking.

20
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:12,495
In the swamp we see visions of people we've lost, people we loved...

21
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:16,248
But what about my vision? It was someone I had never met.

22
00:01:16,315 --> 00:01:20,310
Book Two: Earth
Chapter Six: The Blind Bandit

23
00:01:25,656 --> 00:01:30,075
It's pricey, but I really do like it.

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,756
Then you should get it. You deserve something nice.

25
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,535
I do, don't I? But no. It's too expensive, I shouldn't.

26
00:01:37,542 --> 00:01:40,078
Alright, then don't.

27
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:45,801
You know what? I'm gonna get it.

28
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:51,389
Psst, psst. Hey, you kids like earthbending? You like throwing rocks?

29
00:01:51,396 --> 00:01:55,829
Then check out Master Yu's Earthbending Academy.

30
00:01:57,468 --> 00:02:01,151
Look, there's a coupon on the back. The first lesson is free.

31
00:02:01,156 --> 00:02:03,077
Who knows? This Master Yu could be...

32
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:06,918
...the earthbending teacher you've been looking for.

33
00:02:16,215 --> 00:02:18,483
Take your stances.

34
00:02:18,917 --> 00:02:23,877
Now, strike as if you're punching through your opponents head!

35
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:30,385
So, are you ready to commit to more lessons?

36
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:37,273
If you pay for the whole year in advance, I'll bump you up to the next belt.

37
00:02:38,697 --> 00:02:41,597
Ah, he's not the one.

38
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:45,190
I think The Boulder is gonna win back the belt at Earth Rumble 6.

39
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,803
He's gonna have to fight his way through the best earthbenders...

40
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,903
...in the world to even get a shot at the champ.

41
00:02:49,905 --> 00:02:52,769
Excuse me, but where is this earthbending tournament exactly?

42
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:58,512
It's on the Island of Noneoya... none o' ya business!

43
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:03,582
Oh, I got to remember that one.

44
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,808
I'll take care of this.

45
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,808
Hey strong guys, wait up!

46
00:03:10,027 --> 00:03:16,530
What was I thinking? I don't need a new bag. Why'd you let me buy this?

47
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,590
You ready to find an earthbending teacher?

48
00:03:20,594 --> 00:03:23,338
Because we're going to Earth Rumble 6!

49
00:03:23,342 --> 00:03:25,197
How did you get them to tell you?

50
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,733
Oh, a girl has her ways.

51
00:03:35,943 --> 00:03:40,465
Hey, front row seats! I wonder why no one else is sitting here.

52
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,838
I guess that's why.

53
00:03:49,786 --> 00:03:56,941
Welcome to Earth Rumble 6!
I am your host, Shin Fu!

54
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,603
This is just gonna be a bunch of guys chuckin' rocks at each other, isn't it?

55
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,427
That's what I paid for.

56
00:04:02,435 --> 00:04:09,459
The rules are simple. Just knock the other guy out of the ring and you win.

57
00:04:11,546 --> 00:04:19,269
Round one! The Boulder versus The Big Bad Hippo!

58
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:24,310
Listen up, Hippo. You may be big, but you ain't bad!

59
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:28,716
The Boulder's gonna win this in a landslide.

60
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:32,566
Hippo mad!

61
00:04:43,553 --> 00:04:49,377
Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen! The Hippo is rocking The Boulder!

62
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:05,118
The Boulder wins!

63
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:08,421
How about The Boulder? He's got some good moves.

64
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:12,364
I don't know. Bumi said I need a teacher who listens to the earth.

65
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:16,653
He's just listening to his big muscles. What do you think Sokka?

66
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:25,473
Next match, The Boulder versus Fire Nation Man!

67
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:30,060
Boo! Boo!

68
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:34,995
Please to rise for Fire Nation national anthem.

69
00:05:34,996 --> 00:05:41,605
♫ Fire Lord, my flame burns for thee! ♫

70
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:45,146
Go back to the Fire Nation!

71
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:52,430
No. No please!

72
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:06,416
Yeah! Whoo! The Boulder knows how to put the hurt in the dirt! Yeah! Whoo!

73
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:31,810
Now, the moment you've all been waiting for. The Boulder versus your champion...

74
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:35,854
The Blind Bandit!

75
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:43,434
She can't really be blind. It's just part of her character, right?

76
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:44,970
I think she is.

77
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,683
I think she is... Going down!

78
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:54,555
The Boulder feels conflicted about fighting a young, blind girl.

79
00:06:54,563 --> 00:06:58,549
Sounds to me like you're scared, Boulder.

80
00:06:58,874 --> 00:07:01,815
The Boulder's over his conflicted feelings,...

81
00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:05,817
...and now he's ready to bury you in a rock-a-lanche!

82
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:09,729
Whenever you're ready... The Pebble.

83
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:19,537
It's on!

84
00:07:55,631 --> 00:08:01,582
Your winner, and still the champion, The Blind Bandit!

85
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:04,393
No!

86
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,158
How did she do that?

87
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,623
She waited, and listened.

88
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:13,780
To make things a little more interesting,...

89
00:08:13,787 --> 00:08:21,465
...I'm offering up this sack of gold pieces to anyone who can defeat The Blind Bandit!

90
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,283
What? No one dares to face her?

91
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:27,337
I will!

92
00:08:30,832 --> 00:08:33,967
Go Aang! Avenge The Boulder!

93
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:39,465
Do people really want to see two little girls fighting out here?

94
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:43,299
I don't really want to fight you. I want to talk to you.

95
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:45,540
Boo! No talking!

96
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:47,701
Don't boo at him.

97
00:08:55,753 --> 00:08:57,892
Somebody's a little light on his feet.

98
00:08:57,906 --> 00:09:01,742
What's your fighting name, The Fancy Dancer?

99
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,826
Where'd you go?

100
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,316
Please, wait!

101
00:09:07,322 --> 00:09:09,513
There you are!

102
00:09:20,642 --> 00:09:23,452
Please listen! I need an earthbending teacher,...

103
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:25,662
...and I think it's supposed to be you.

104
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:29,327
Whoever you are, just leave me alone.

105
00:09:30,349 --> 00:09:32,131
Wait!

106
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:41,823
Way to go, champ!

107
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:50,670
I gotta admit, now I'm really glad I bought this bag.

108
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:53,313
It matches the belt perfectly.

109
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:55,333
That is a big relief.

110
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,105
If we want to find The Blind Bandit,...

111
00:09:57,109 --> 00:10:00,574
...the Earthbending Academy is a good place to start.

112
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:06,388
Oh great, you again.

113
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,607
Yeah, I didn't think so.

114
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:10,926
Nicely done.

115
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:13,662
Hey, you're the kid who beat The Blind Bandit.

116
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:17,000
We need to talk to her. Do you guys know where she lives?

117
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:22,555
The Blind Bandit's a mystery. She shows up to fight, then disappears.

118
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,442
Let me handle this. You're not telling us everything!

119
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:31,175
No no, I swear it's true! No one knows where she goes, or who she really is.

120
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,071
That's because we're asking about the wrong person.

121
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,529
In my vision, I saw a girl in a white dress with a pet flying boar.

122
00:10:38,547 --> 00:10:39,842
Know anybody like that?

123
00:10:39,845 --> 00:10:43,106
Well, a flying boar is the symbol of the Bei Fong family.

124
00:10:43,113 --> 00:10:46,781
They're the richest people in town, probably the whole world.

125
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:48,789
Yeah, but they don't have a daughter.

126
00:10:48,794 --> 00:10:51,769
Flying boar is good enough for me. Let's check it out.

127
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,061
Yeah, you better leave.

128
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:57,242
Hey, I've got my eye on you.

129
00:10:57,252 --> 00:10:59,323
Water Tribe.

130
00:11:00,152 --> 00:11:03,449
I'm telling you, The Boulder was standing right there.

131
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,858
I saw the kid strike, but there was no earthbending.

132
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:11,187
Nothing made contact. The Blind Bandit just fell out of the ring.

133
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:16,059
She must have took a dive and split the money with the kid.

134
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,777
Nobody cheats Xin Fu.

135
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:31,909
That's the flying boar from my vision. Come on.

136
00:11:46,701 --> 00:11:48,757
What are you doing here, Twinkle Toes?

137
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:50,077
How did you know it was me?

138
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:53,166
Don't answer to Twinkle Toes. It's not manly!

139
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,823
You're the one whose bag matches his belt.

140
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:57,291
How did you find me?

141
00:11:57,295 --> 00:12:01,181
Well, a crazy king told me I had to find an earthbender who listens to the earth.

142
00:12:01,191 --> 00:12:03,305
And then I had a vision in a magic swamp and...

143
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:06,717
What Aang is trying to say is, he's the Avatar,...

144
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,569
...and if he doesn't master earthbending soon...

145
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,993
...he won't be able to defeat the Fire Lord.

146
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,984
Not my problem. Now get out of here or I'll call the guards.

147
00:12:15,988 --> 00:12:18,411
Look, we all have to do our part to win this war.

148
00:12:18,422 --> 00:12:21,456
And yours is to teach Aang earthbending.

149
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:25,628
Guards! Guards, help!

150
00:12:27,105 --> 00:12:28,683
Toph, what happened?

151
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:32,715
I thought I heard someone. I got scared.

152
00:12:32,728 --> 00:12:34,439
You know your father doesn't want you...

153
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,688
...wandering the grounds without supervision, Toph.

154
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,453
I'm pleased to hear that Toph's private lessons are going well,...

155
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,162
...but I want to be sure that she's not trying anything too dangerous.

156
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:57,280
Absolutely not. I'm keeping her at the beginner's level.

157
00:12:57,281 --> 00:13:00,744
Basic forms and breathing exercises only.

158
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:02,578
Very good.

159
00:13:02,588 --> 00:13:06,430
Excuse me sir, but you have a visitor.

160
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:10,090
Who thinks they are so important they can just come to my home unannounced?

161
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:14,560
Uh, the Avatar, Sir.

162
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:27,213
Blow on it. It's too hot for her.

163
00:13:27,218 --> 00:13:29,700
Allow me.

164
00:13:31,057 --> 00:13:32,489
Oh my!

165
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,724
Avatar Aang, it's an honor to have you visit us.

166
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:40,901
In your opinion, how much longer do you think the war will last?

167
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,459
I'd like to defeat the Fire Lord by the end of summer,...

168
00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:48,853
...but I can't do that without finding an earthbending teacher first.

169
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:52,348
Well, Master Yu is the finest teacher in the land.

170
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,749
He's been teaching Toph since she was little.

171
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,473
Then she must be a great earthbender,...

172
00:13:57,493 --> 00:14:01,138
...probably good enough to teach someone else.

173
00:14:03,728 --> 00:14:06,418
Toph is still learning the basics.

174
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:09,266
Yes, and sadly because of her blindness,...

175
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:13,011
...I don't think she will ever become a true master.

176
00:14:13,015 --> 00:14:16,836
Oh, I'm sure she's better than you think she is.

177
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,365
What's your problem?

178
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:36,992
What's your problem?

179
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,476
Well, shall we move to the living room for dessert then?

180
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,852
Good night buddy.

181
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:59,117
Relax. Look, I'm sorry about dinner. Let's call a truce, okay?

182
00:14:59,234 --> 00:15:04,500
Even though I was born blind, I've never had a problem seeing.

183
00:15:04,511 --> 00:15:09,107
I see with earthbending. It's kind of like seeing with my feet.

184
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:14,500
I feel the vibrations in the earth, and I can see where everything is.

185
00:15:14,504 --> 00:15:19,940
You, that tree, even those ants.

186
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,213
That's amazing.

187
00:15:23,225 --> 00:15:29,120
My parents don't understand. They've always treated me like I was helpless.

188
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,845
Is that why you became The Blind Bandit?

189
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:33,043
Yeah.

190
00:15:33,056 --> 00:15:35,462
Then why stay here where you're not happy?

191
00:15:35,474 --> 00:15:40,261
They're my parents. Where else am I supposed to go?

192
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,430
You could come with us.

193
00:15:41,443 --> 00:15:44,740
Yeah. You guys get to go wherever you want.

194
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:53,003
No one telling you what to do, that's the life. It's just not my life.

195
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,416
We're being ambushed.

196
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:17,530
I think you kids owe me some money.

197
00:16:21,766 --> 00:16:24,914
Whoever took Aang and Toph left this.

198
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:29,297
"If you want to see your daughter again, bring 500 gold pieces to the arena."

199
00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:31,578
It's signed "Xin Fu and The Boulder."

200
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:33,671
I can't believe it.

201
00:16:33,684 --> 00:16:37,247
I have the Boulder's autograph!

202
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:41,179
Master Yu, I need you to help you get my daughter back.

203
00:16:41,191 --> 00:16:43,600
We're going with you.

204
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:46,739
Poor Toph. She must be so scared.

205
00:16:46,743 --> 00:16:48,162
You think you're so tough...

206
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,432
...why don't you come up here so I can smack that grin off your face?

207
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,417
I'm not smiling.

208
00:16:53,432 --> 00:16:55,485
Toph!

209
00:16:55,501 --> 00:16:59,141
Here's your money. Now let them go.

210
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:10,153
What about Aang?

211
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,363
I think the Fire Nation will pay a hefty price for the Avatar.

212
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:18,938
Now, get out of my ring.

213
00:17:33,495 --> 00:17:36,121
Go. I'll be ok.

214
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:43,559
Toph, there's too many of them. We need an earthbender. We need you!

215
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,961
My daughter is blind. She is blind and tiny and helpless and fragile.

216
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:51,075
She cannot help you.

217
00:17:51,081 --> 00:17:54,686
Yes, I can.

218
00:18:00,154 --> 00:18:04,595
Let him go. I beat you all before, and I'll do it again.

219
00:18:04,607 --> 00:18:08,679
The Boulder takes issue with that comment.

220
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:12,526
Wait.

221
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:19,797
They're mine.

222
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:08,428
Hit it harder!

223
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,696
I'm trying!

224
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:15,167
I never knew. Your daughter's amazing.

225
00:21:06,237 --> 00:21:12,006
She's the greatest earthbender I've ever seen!

226
00:21:12,268 --> 00:21:15,995
Dad, I know it's probably hard for you to see me this way,...

227
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:21,042
...but the obedient little helpless blind girl that you think I am just isn't me.

228
00:21:21,053 --> 00:21:28,232
I love fighting. I love being an earthbender. And I'm really, really good at it.

229
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:30,509
I know I've kept my life secret from you,...

230
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:33,640
...but you were keeping me secret from the whole world.

231
00:21:33,647 --> 00:21:35,384
You were doing it to protect me.

232
00:21:35,398 --> 00:21:40,440
But I'm twelve years old and I've never had a real friend.

233
00:21:40,476 --> 00:21:42,642
So now that you see who I really am,...

234
00:21:42,654 --> 00:21:45,034
...I hope it doesn't change the way you feel about me.

235
00:21:45,052 --> 00:21:48,621
Of course it doesn't change the way I feel about you, Toph.

236
00:21:48,635 --> 00:21:50,929
It's made me realize something.

237
00:21:50,941 --> 00:21:52,190
It has?

238
00:21:52,203 --> 00:21:55,878
Yes. I've let you have far too much freedom.

239
00:21:55,892 --> 00:22:00,199
From now on, you will be cared for and guarded 24 hours a day.

240
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,125
But dad!

241
00:22:01,156 --> 00:22:03,952
We are doing this for your own good, Toph.

242
00:22:03,962 --> 00:22:10,137
Please escort the Avatar and his friends out. They are no longer welcome here.

243
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:11,623
I'm sorry, Toph.

244
00:22:11,635 --> 00:22:16,042
I'm sorry, too. Good bye, Aang.

245
00:22:20,141 --> 00:22:22,943
Don't worry. We'll find you a teacher.

246
00:22:22,955 --> 00:22:25,755
There are plenty of amazing earthbenders out there.

247
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,052
Not like her.

248
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,265
Toph! What are you doing here?

249
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:44,794
My dad changed his mind. He said I was free to travel the world.

250
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:49,356
Well, we'd better get out of here... before your dad changes his mind again.

251
00:22:49,373 --> 00:22:50,925
Good idea.

252
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,312
You're gonna be a great teacher, Toph.

253
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:56,688
Speaking of which, I want to show you something.

254
00:22:56,698 --> 00:22:58,780
Okay.

255
00:22:59,695 --> 00:23:01,300
Now we're even.

256
00:23:01,312 --> 00:23:04,801
Um, I'll take the belt back.

257
00:23:07,738 --> 00:23:09,847
Sorry.

258
00:23:11,152 --> 00:23:13,320
I know you two are very different...

259
00:23:13,335 --> 00:23:17,107
...but I believe you have a common interest.

260
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:23,204
The Avatar has kidnapped my daughter.

261
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:30,310
I want you to do whatever it takes to bring her home.

262
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:38,240
