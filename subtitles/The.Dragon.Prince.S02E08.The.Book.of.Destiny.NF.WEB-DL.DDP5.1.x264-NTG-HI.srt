00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,688
I'm right here.

00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,526
What are you doing?

7
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,154
Your kind of magic.

I... I can't move, Claudia.

I can't move!

Who... who are you?

00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,310
Ah...

17
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:06,483
How long I have waited to hear
the sound of another voice.

18
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,527
How may I serve you?

[roaring]

21
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:58,034
[Rayla] Come on. We've gotta keep moving.
We're so close to the border.

22
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,371
We could be in Xadia in just a few hours.

23
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,499
I know we're close, Rayla,
but Callum's not doing well.

24
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,460
That's his own fault
for messing with dark magic.

25
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:12,173
Mmm-hmm. Yes, you're right.
We must move onward.

26
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,176
I'm okay.

27
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,679
I just need to rest my eyes while we walk.

28
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:34,237
- I don't feel anything.
- Can you feel it when I do this?

29
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,406
No, what are you doing?

30
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,534
- I'm pinching you, Soren.
- Well, that's just rude.

31
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,746
Hold on. I'll have you back
on your feet in no time.

32
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,591
And the last step has just a tad

Oh, do we really have to... [gagging]

[chanting]

35
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,989
Well, that was super pretty,
but I still can't move.

36
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,325
You can't? But that should have...

37
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,368
Hold on. I must have something.

38
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,457
Ugh, that's all I have for healing.

39
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,627
Well, don't just stand there!

40
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,088
Help me get him back to town.
We need to find a doctor.

41
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,433
[Callum] I'm so uncomfortable.

42
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,603
[Rayla] Uncomfortable with your choice
to use dark magic, perhaps?

[Ezran] Rayla!

So uncomfortable.

No!

49
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,049
We've searched everywhere.
Lord Viren is nowhere to be found.

50
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,718
Keep looking.

51
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,596
And when you do find him,
be ready for anything.

52
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,348
Do not underestimate him.

53
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,778
- Who are you?
- My name would mean nothing to you.

00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,285
I don't know.

00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,206
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not lying. I never lie.

[sighs]

58
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,252
I found this mirror
in the lair of the Dragon King.

59
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,548
This mirror meant something to him.
You meant something to him.

60
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,883
Perhaps.

61
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:47,180
Tell me what you need,
and I will help you.

62
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,098
I need your name.

63
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,065
Aaravos.

00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,144
Who are you?

00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,274
Who... who are you?

66
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,404
- He's delirious.
- [Ezran] It's getting worse.

[stones clinking]

68
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,790
Who's there? Show yourself,
or I'll greet you with my pointy friends.

69
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,626
You.

[gasps]

71
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,719
I'm not here to fight.

72
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,641
My name is Corvus.
Your Aunt Amaya sent me.

73
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,822
I am here to serve the king.

74
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,036
King Ezran.

75
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,937
Well? How long will it take
for him to get better?

76
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,648
He's not going to get better.

77
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,734
- What?
- He won't die.

78
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,862
He's lucky to have survived
a direct attack from a dragon.

79
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,364
But he's never going to walk again.

80
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,497
I haven't told him yet.

81
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,001
Don't. I'll tell him.
He should hear it from me.

82
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:28,382
But I'm not the king.
I'm just a prince. My dad is...

83
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,762
Wait. That's not what you're saying.
He isn't...

84
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:40,061
- No! No, no, no!
- Ezran, it's going to be okay.

85
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:44,482
You knew? I'm an idiot!
I should have figured it out.

86
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:48,194
When we met you, you had two
of those assassiny ribbony things,

87
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,112
but one of them came off that night.

88
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,699
That's right.
That must have been when he fell.

89
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,869
- "Fell"?
- Yes.

90
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,413
"Fell"? He didn't fall, Rayla.

91
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,791
He didn't trip and land on the ground.
He got killed!

He knows.

95
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,847
I'm going for a walk.

96
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,058
I can't let you go alone.

97
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,354
If I am the king,
then you have to let me go.

98
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,692
You're not my king.

99
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,529
But you are my friend,
and I'm coming with you.

100
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,155
[sighs] Rayla, please.

101
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,367
Just let me go be alone. Please.

Shh! You're in a library.

- Yes, I'm quite aware I'm in a...
- [woman] Shh!

113
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,378
Callum, don't be frightened.

114
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,214
I'm not, I'm just...

115
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,340
[both]...confused.

116
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,092
Of course you are.

117
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,845
You tried dark magic for the first time.
No one expects that to be easy.

118
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,849
But that's the thing.
It was easy. Too easy.

119
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,143
Even though I know it's wrong.

120
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,522
- But is it really so wrong?
- Yes.

121
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,817
- Is it, though?
- Yes.

122
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,276
- Is it?
- Yes!

123

[voice echoing]

124
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,366
Callum, look at me.
You're looking at yourself.

125
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:44,912
- You need to accept your destiny.
- I can't do that.

126
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,081
You're a human.

127
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,626
You weren't born with an Arcanum
to do primal magic,

128
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,963
but you were born to do magic.

129
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,257
The kind of magic humans can do.

130
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,760
You can have unlimited power.

131
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,806
And you can choose
what to do with that power!

132
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,559
You can make
a real difference in the world.

133
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:10,062
All you need to do now is accept it.

134
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,023
Your destiny is already written.

135
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,660

Hey, Sor-Sor.

138
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,674
All the people in town
are talking about you.

139
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:42,094
About how you faced the dragon
and saved the town.

140
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,472
Everyone's calling you a hero.

141
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,767
Saved them from a problem I caused, maybe.
Is that what heroes do?

142
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:57,151
So I... I talked to the doctor.
And I guess they did some tests...

143
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,278
- I already know.
- What?

144
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:05,201
I can't move. I can't walk.
And it's not going to get better.

145
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,036
[children laughing]

146
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:14,668
You know what? It's for the best.
I'm glad I can't move.

147
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,921
What are you talking about?

148
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,798
Soren, why would you say that?

149
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,469
Before we left,
Dad gave me a secret mission.

150
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,552
He did?

151
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:29,058
I was confused,
and I didn't want to do it, but...

152
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:33,187
I do want Dad to love me
and be proud of me.

153
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,983
He is proud of you, no matter what.

154
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:42,821
Dad is so smart,
so I figured there must be a good reason.

155
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,283
Soren, what did Dad ask you to do?

156
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,246
Kill the princes.

157
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,373
Kill them?

158
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,584
[scoffs] No.

159
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,712
No. No, that can't be right.
You must have misunderstood.

160
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,967
Now I can't do anything terrible,
because...

161
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,554
now I can't do anything.

162
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,519
Accept your destiny.

163
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,362
[Harrow] Callum.

164
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,740
You are free.

165
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:31,203
You are free from both the past
and the future.

166
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:35,207
Nothing is written in stone.
Fate is a lie.

167
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,835
You are free!

168
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:45,092
Look inside yourself, Callum.
This is your destiny. You can't deny it.

169
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,693
No! I get to choose who I want to be.

170
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,905
Your destiny is already written!

171
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:10,117
No! Destiny is a book you write yourself!

172
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,478
[exhales heavily] That was horrifying.

173
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,065
It's your dream, kid.

174
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,161
The king is missing.

175
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,664
He's not missing. He just went for a walk.

176
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,416
And he hasn't returned,
and we don't know where he is.

177
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,877
- Right.
- That is the definition of missing!

178
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,297
Yeah. Yeah, you're right. He's missing.

179
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,591
You shouldn't have let him go.
We need to find him.

180
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,762
Aren't you a tracker?
Isn't this your whole job?

181
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:16,058
Yes. I shall bring the king back safely.

182
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,142
You have my word.

183
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:23,065
- Ooh, I have his word.
- [Bait grunts]

184
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,696
It's okay, Clauds. I'm relieved, actually.

185
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,572
I'm... I'm free to do what I want,

186
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,867
with no expectations from Dad or...
or anyone.

187
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,621
So, what are you gonna do
with this newfound...

188
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,706
freedom?

189
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,208
I've been thinking about that
for the last ten minutes,

190
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,670
and I've decided
I'm going to reinvent myself.

191
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,214
I'm gonna be a poet, Claudia!

192
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,342
[laughs]

193
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,304
You're not joking?

194
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:58,350
I'm going to be a poet,
and people will come hear my poems.

195
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:03,022
They'll come visit me, and we'll drink
some kind of... soothing tea.

196
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,608
And then... and then,
I'll say my latest poems to them.

197
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,694
[sighs] Soren, are you sure?

198
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,406
I already have my first poem.
It's a haiku.

199
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,116
Just, uh, tell me when you're ready.

200
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:18,620
[sighs] Um... okay. Ready.

201
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,247
[inhales deeply]

202
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,960
Dragon smash boy. Say the good words now.

203
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,255
They light the hearts of other people.

204
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,926
Do you like it? I'm inspiring, right?

205
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:38,223
No, Soren, no. That was a terrible poem.
And it... it's not even a haiku!

206
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,561
Oh... I can't leave you like this.
There has to be something.

207
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,449
[objects shattering]

208
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,204
You need to calm down.

209
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:06,210
No, I don't. You need to... calm up!
You need to help him!

210
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,087
This is a hospital.

211
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,881
Miss, we're going to have
to assist you out of here.

212
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:15,302
He can't be like this.
He can't even count syllables!

213
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,888
[grunting]

214
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:18,972
[yelps]

215
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,360
[wind rushing]

216
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,866
Ahoy, Callum! I hear ye be needing a boat.

217
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,204
Am I be needing a boat?

218
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:46,458
You am! For yer voyage!
Into yer own heart and mind.

219
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,173
Let's hope the weather be nice there.

220
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,179
[screaming]

221
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,932
[laughing maniacally]

222
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,060
- Hoist the mainsail!
- What?

223
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,895
I don't know how to hoist any sails.

224
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:11,859
It's yer journey.
You be the sail, and I'll hoist ye!

225
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:15,612
- Find the wind, boy! Be like a wing!
- [screaming]

226
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,322
[Villads laughing]

227
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,336
[Berto squawks] I have questions.

228
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,897
You're making this easy for me,
young King!

229
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,409
Oh, no. This can't be happening.

230
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,003
What's going on?

231
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:17,257
Every time I found a mention of you
in an ancient scroll or tome,

232
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,969
the entire passage disappeared
as soon as I looked!

233
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,681
[sighs] What game are you playing?

234
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,821
[sighs]

235
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,745
Ugh!

236
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,829
[sighs]

237
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,791
Why should I trust you?

238
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:57,297
You shouldn't... yet.

239
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,552
[gulps]

240
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,767
[clears throat]

241
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,110
What's wrong? What happened?
Did you lose his trail?

242
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,279
No. It's worse than that.

243
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,446
What do you mean?

244
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:26,618
King Ezran's trail ends very clearly,
very badly.

245
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,288
His footprints are replaced
by banther tracks.

246
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,207
- The king's been eaten by a banther!
- [gasps]

247
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:38,463
[laughs] Great job.
You've lost the King of Katolis.

248
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,841
This isn't funny. Why are you laughing?

249
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:44,594
[sighs] Your king happens to be
a very special boy.

250
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,471
He can talk to animals.

251
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,265
So if there are banther tracks,

252
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:52,769
it means Ezran caught a ride
on the banther, not in the banther.

253
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,564
[laughing]

254
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,739
Okay, Claudia, calm down.
Everything's going to be okay.

255
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,782
Just... say your calming mantra.

256
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:06,992
[sighs]

257
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,827
There is no synonym for cinnamon.

258
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,789
There is no synonym for cinnamon.
There is no synonym for cinnamon.

259
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,500
There is no synonym for cinnamon.
There is no... [gasps]

260
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,048
[creature growling]

[panting]

266
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,297
You messed with something
you shouldn't have messed with,

267
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,907
- and now you're paying the price.
- Help!

268
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:48,991
Help.

269
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,036
[Rayla] You'll get through this.

270
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,661
[groans]

271
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,915
You big dumb human.

272
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,386
Your conscience is a messy place, boyo!

- [gasping]
- Callum!

280

[Rayla] <i>Callum!</i>
