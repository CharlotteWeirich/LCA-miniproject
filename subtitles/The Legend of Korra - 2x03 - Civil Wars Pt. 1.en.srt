1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:02,168
Earth.

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,337
Fire.

3
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:06,106
Air.

4
00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:08,025
Water.

5
00:00:08,027 --> 00:00:12,362
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:12,364 --> 00:00:13,847
and bring balance to the world.

7

8
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:22,372
Korra has reopened
the Southern spirit portal

9
00:00:22,374 --> 00:00:24,357
and taken the first step
to restoring balance

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,159
between spirits and man.

11
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:28,545
Meanwhile, tensions are high
between Korra and her father

12
00:00:28,547 --> 00:00:31,264
after she discovered he was
hiding a dark secret.

13
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:33,634
Years ago, Tonraq was banished
from the north.

14
00:00:33,636 --> 00:00:37,037
And now the northern Navy
has landed on Southern shores.

15
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,973
What other plans does Unalaq
have for the Avatar?

16
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:54,488
Everyone, clear the streets.

17
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,606
Get back in your homes.

18
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,937
Uncle, why did you bring
your troops down from the north?

19
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,522
Now that you've opened
the Southern portal,

20
00:01:28,524 --> 00:01:30,223
we need to protect it
from people

21
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:31,892
who would do the spirits harm.

22
00:01:31,894 --> 00:01:32,976
I can protect it.

23
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:35,595
I need you for something
more important.

24
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:37,864
There is another portal
in the north.

25
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:41,451
Once you open it,
spirits and man will be able

26
00:01:41,453 --> 00:01:43,370
to move freely between the north
and the South

27
00:01:43,372 --> 00:01:45,105
in a matter of seconds.

28
00:01:45,107 --> 00:01:46,873
But the solstice is over.

29
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,241
How am I going to open it?

30
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:51,712
The spiritual energy
is much stronger in the north.

31
00:01:51,714 --> 00:01:53,947
And now that you've opened
the Southern portal,

32
00:01:53,949 --> 00:01:56,616
your energy is stronger
as well.

33
00:01:56,618 --> 00:02:00,337
With both portals open,
our tribes will be united again.

34
00:02:00,339 --> 00:02:03,289
The world will be united again.

35
00:02:15,937 --> 00:02:19,322
Ahh, I haven't felt
this at peace since...

36
00:02:19,324 --> 00:02:21,675
Wahoo!

37
00:02:21,677 --> 00:02:23,009
And it's over.

38
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:25,245
Good morning, universe!

39
00:02:25,247 --> 00:02:27,914
Bumi, please.
Cover yourself.

40
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,249
Well, lookee here.

41
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:32,686
"Vacation Tenzin" has finally
decided to join us.

42
00:02:32,688 --> 00:02:35,255
Yes, he has.

43
00:02:35,257 --> 00:02:37,457
It's so nice to get
to spend more time

44
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:38,558
with my family.

45
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,926
Isn't that right,

46
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:41,595
my little Rohan?

47
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:46,500
And I've really enjoyed
having you two around.

48
00:02:46,502 --> 00:02:48,602
Reminds me of all those
great vacations we took

49
00:02:48,604 --> 00:02:50,036
as kids with dad.

50
00:02:50,038 --> 00:02:52,806
Uh, I think your memory
is a little foggy.

51
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:55,675
Bumi and I weren't
on those great vacations.

52
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:57,944
It was always just you and dad.

53
00:02:57,946 --> 00:03:00,013
No, that can't be right.

54
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:01,982
What about the time he took us
to Kyoshi island

55
00:03:01,984 --> 00:03:03,450
to ride the elephant-koi?

56
00:03:03,452 --> 00:03:05,752
Nope.
We weren't there.

57
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:07,187
Hmm.

58
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:09,289
Oh, remember ember island?

59
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,292
Those amazing sand palaces
we built on the beach?

60
00:03:12,294 --> 00:03:14,094
You mean you built.

61
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:15,629
We never saw the place.

62
00:03:15,631 --> 00:03:17,731
I could've sworn...

63
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:21,868
- Woo-hoo!
- Morning, kids.

64
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,471
Morning, Uncle Bumi.

65
00:03:24,473 --> 00:03:25,806
Do you have a baby in there?

66
00:03:29,178 --> 00:03:31,561
Where's your sister?

67
00:03:31,563 --> 00:03:33,063
Who?

68
00:03:33,065 --> 00:03:36,433
Ikki. About this tall.
Talks real fast.

69
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:37,767
I'm sure you know her.

70
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:39,436
Uh...

71
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:41,688
There was a lemur fight,
but the bison told us

72
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,107
not to worry
because a giant was coming.

73
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:47,244
Then we almost got eaten
by a shark-squid.

74
00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:49,729
The shark-squid?
He's here?

75
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:53,399
It appears my old Nemesis
has found me.

76
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:56,569
Jinora, were you and Meelo
teasing your sister again?

77
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,121
I don't know.

78
00:03:58,123 --> 00:03:59,506
Maybe.

79
00:03:59,508 --> 00:04:00,507
Yes.

80
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:04,611
She ran away.

81
00:04:04,613 --> 00:04:09,216
Honestly, I don't know why
you kids can't just get along!

82
00:04:09,218 --> 00:04:10,884
It's all right, dear.

83
00:04:10,886 --> 00:04:13,653
Ikki couldn't have gone far.
I'll find her.

84
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:16,106
Commander Bumi
reporting for duty!

85
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:19,059
Search-and-rescue missions
are my specialty.

86
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:21,811
What do you say
we all go together?

87
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:23,697
Sure.
I could use the help.

88
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,732
When I get back,
we'll come up with a plan

89
00:04:25,734 --> 00:04:29,786
to take down that shark-squid
once and for all.

90
00:04:29,788 --> 00:04:30,288
Yeah!

91
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:36,276
Thank you for coming, everyone.

92
00:04:36,278 --> 00:04:38,912
I know these last few days
have been very troubling.

93
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:39,996
Troubling?

94
00:04:39,998 --> 00:04:41,498
Troubling is when I get
that itchy rash

95
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,632
that won't go away,

96
00:04:42,634 --> 00:04:44,217
and Zhu Li's not around
to scratch it.

97
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:46,720
This is shocking.
Nay, sickening!

98
00:04:46,722 --> 00:04:48,889
But these kale cookies?
Opposite.

99
00:04:48,891 --> 00:04:51,508
Remind me to get
the recipe later.

100
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,143
What's your point, Varrick?

101
00:04:53,145 --> 00:04:54,728
My point is,

102
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,462
Unalaq's already booted
our chieftains

103
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:57,731
out of their palace.

104
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:59,065
How long before he starts
telling us

105
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:00,767
what kind of cookies
we can eat?

106
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:02,435
Probably a couple of days.

107
00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:04,771
Rhetorical question, Zhu Li.
You gotta keep up.

108
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:06,990
Not to mention I've got
a cargo ship full of Halibut

109
00:05:06,992 --> 00:05:09,359
that's rotting,
thanks to this harbor lockdown.

110
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:11,945
Who wants to buy a ship full
of stinking fish?

111
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:16,616
Seriously, it's not rhetorical.
I need to sell these fish.

112
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:18,868
Chief Unalaq is here
to help the South.

113
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,537
He wants to show us
how to restore balance

114
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:22,339
with the spirits
so they'll stop attacking.

115
00:05:22,341 --> 00:05:25,375
The only spirit
I'm interested in restoring

116
00:05:25,377 --> 00:05:27,177
is our spirit of independence!

117
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:28,261
Am I right, people?

118
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:32,599
All Unalaq is trying to do

119
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:34,851
is make our tribes
unified again.

120
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:37,771
No, he wants control
of our wealth.

121
00:05:37,773 --> 00:05:41,308
My wealth.
And I like my wealth.

122
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,143
If Unalaq doesn't pull
his forces out,

123
00:05:43,145 --> 00:05:46,012
then we have no choice
but to fight for our freedom!

124
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:50,784
You want to start a war?
Are you crazy?

125
00:05:50,786 --> 00:05:53,954
Unalaq started this, not us.

126
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:57,190
I'm sorry.

127
00:05:57,192 --> 00:05:59,492
Maybe you could speak
with your Uncle.

128
00:05:59,494 --> 00:06:01,995
Tell him how frustrated
we all are.

129
00:06:01,997 --> 00:06:05,081
He'll listen to what
the Avatar has to say.

130
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,050
Do it for me.

131
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:10,420
I'll do it for the tribe.

132
00:06:11,673 --> 00:06:14,591
I cannot stop eating
these things.

133
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:17,143
Look, we all know
where this conflict is heading.

134
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:21,431
We need to start preparing
for war.

135
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,935
I will hate to leave
this quaint tribe.

136
00:06:25,937 --> 00:06:27,604
Is that true, Eska?

137
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:29,906
Of course not, Desna.
I will not miss it at all.

138
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:32,492
I hold immense dislike
for the South.

139
00:06:35,831 --> 00:06:37,563
Bolin!
Laugh at my humorous quip.

140
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:40,784
Yes, dear.

141
00:06:40,786 --> 00:06:42,869
So... so funny.

142
00:06:48,927 --> 00:06:52,045
You know, I'll be really sad

143
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:53,380
when you have to leave.

144
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:56,049
It's been really great
getting to know you.

145
00:06:56,051 --> 00:06:57,267
Really.

146
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:00,253
But you will be coming
with me to the north.

147
00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:02,188
There we will live
the rest of our lives together

148
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,224
in icy bliss.

149
00:07:04,226 --> 00:07:06,309
Foolish bolin.

150
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:08,778
Mako!
I'm so happy to see you!

151
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,146
Uh, you all right, bro?

152
00:07:10,148 --> 00:07:11,281
No!
No, I'm not all right!

153
00:07:11,283 --> 00:07:12,615
I can't take anymore.

154
00:07:12,617 --> 00:07:15,285
Listen, I don't want to live
in icy bliss with Eska!

155
00:07:15,287 --> 00:07:16,820
Don't make me!

156
00:07:16,822 --> 00:07:19,272
Oh, please,
please don't make me.

157
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:21,074
Uh, hey,
if you're that unhappy,

158
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:22,659
just break up with her.

159
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:24,961
Break up with her?
You can do that?

160
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:26,579
Yeah.
Guys do it all the time.

161
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:27,914
How?

162
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,632
Just tell her you're not
that into her anymore.

163
00:07:29,634 --> 00:07:31,668
Oh, no, no, I don't think
she'd like that.

164
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,453
Ending a relationship
is kind of like

165
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:35,505
pulling off
a bloodsucking leech.

166
00:07:35,507 --> 00:07:37,424
You just gotta rip it off
and get it over with.

167
00:07:37,426 --> 00:07:39,142
You'll feel a lot better
afterwards.

168
00:07:39,144 --> 00:07:40,727
Trust me.

169
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:42,595
Thanks, mako.
Whew.

170
00:07:42,597 --> 00:07:44,681
I'm lucky you're so good
at breaking girls' hearts.

171
00:07:44,683 --> 00:07:46,733
Korra better watch out.

172
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:49,652
Ooh, no, it's just a...

173
00:07:49,654 --> 00:07:52,405
uh, you kn...
uh, never mind.

174
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:02,749
Our next training session
isn't until tomorrow.

175
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:05,251
I'm sorry to interrupt.

176
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:07,454
It's about our conversation
this morning.

177
00:08:07,456 --> 00:08:08,705
Yes?

178
00:08:08,707 --> 00:08:10,590
I understand why
you brought your troops here,

179
00:08:10,592 --> 00:08:13,176
but I'm afraid it's sending
the wrong message.

180
00:08:13,178 --> 00:08:15,295
Your father has been talking
to you.

181
00:08:15,297 --> 00:08:17,630
Not just him.
Varrick too.

182
00:08:17,632 --> 00:08:19,766
There was a meeting
at my parents' house.

183
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:21,968
A lot of southerners feel
like their tribe

184
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,353
is being invaded.

185
00:08:23,355 --> 00:08:25,355
I am their chief.

186
00:08:25,357 --> 00:08:27,891
I'm uniting, not invading.

187
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:31,694
I know, but I'm just afraid
if something doesn't change,

188
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:33,696
there could be a civil war.

189
00:08:33,698 --> 00:08:36,015
If the water tribes
were at war,

190
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:38,284
the other nations
would take sides.

191
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:41,354
The dark spirits would thrive
off this negative energy,

192
00:08:41,356 --> 00:08:43,022
and the world would be thrown
into a battle

193
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,690
between spirits and man.

194
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,292
That would be catastrophic.

195
00:08:46,294 --> 00:08:48,861
- How do we stop it?
- We?

196
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:50,630
No, Korra.

197
00:08:50,632 --> 00:08:53,550
This is a war only the Avatar
can prevent.

198
00:08:57,196 --> 00:08:59,164
I'm usually the one
starting fights.

199
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,033
I don't know how to stop them
from happening.

200
00:09:01,035 --> 00:09:03,635
As the Avatar,
you must remain neutral

201
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:05,003
in this conflict.

202
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:07,139
You will naturally want
to help your people,

203
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:09,574
but showing favoritism
will not help our tribes

204
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:11,176
find unity.

205
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:13,211
Maybe Tenzin was right.

206
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:15,213
Maybe I'm not ready
to be the Avatar.

207
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:17,149
Tenzin lacked faith in you.

208
00:09:17,151 --> 00:09:19,284
But I have no doubt
you will become

209
00:09:19,286 --> 00:09:22,387
the most admired Avatar
the world has ever known.

210
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:24,356
Thank you, Uncle.

211
00:09:39,222 --> 00:09:40,338
Who threw those?

212
00:09:46,513 --> 00:09:48,513
You hoodlums think
you're tough, huh?

213
00:09:48,515 --> 00:09:50,515
Pick on a waterbender
your own size!

214
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:56,321
Stop!

215
00:09:56,323 --> 00:09:58,240
Tell these thugs
to go back to the north.

216
00:09:58,242 --> 00:09:59,875
They're not welcome here
anymore!

217
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:02,043
These southerners
need to stay in line.

218
00:10:02,045 --> 00:10:03,745
Everyone, calm down.

219
00:10:03,747 --> 00:10:05,297
You're all part
of the same tribe.

220
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:06,548
Start acting like it.

221
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,216
You're taking their side?

222
00:10:08,218 --> 00:10:09,885
We thought you were one of us.

223
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:11,670
I'm not taking anyone's side.

224
00:10:11,672 --> 00:10:12,804
Hey!

225
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:15,724
You're the worst Avatar ever!

226
00:10:17,877 --> 00:10:22,514
Everyone, walk away from this.

227
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:24,599
They're not worth our trouble.

228
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:27,719
Go back to your homes.

229
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:40,448
Korra, I...

230
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,401
Korra!

231
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:49,741
Ikki!

232
00:10:49,743 --> 00:10:53,628
Ikki!

233
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,747
Ikki?

234
00:10:55,749 --> 00:10:58,249
Ikki, where are you?

235
00:10:58,251 --> 00:11:01,085
Over here, dad!

236
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:03,638
Just kidding. It's me!

237
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:07,425
There's no sign
of her anywhere.

238
00:11:07,427 --> 00:11:10,061
Why would ikki
run off like this?

239
00:11:10,063 --> 00:11:11,863
Ah, it's probably my fault.

240
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:14,032
- Probably.
- Excuse me?

241
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:15,700
I'm guessing you've been
so busy

242
00:11:15,702 --> 00:11:17,485
with your "duty"
to Republic city

243
00:11:17,487 --> 00:11:19,704
that you forgot about your duty
to your kids.

244
00:11:19,706 --> 00:11:21,740
Duty.

245
00:11:21,742 --> 00:11:23,875
What are you, five years old?

246
00:11:23,877 --> 00:11:25,410
Kya, you're right.

247
00:11:25,412 --> 00:11:27,295
I haven't been spending
enough time with them.

248
00:11:27,297 --> 00:11:28,914
I wish I could be
as good a father

249
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,832
as dad was to us.

250
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:34,753
Tenzin, your problem is
you're exactly like dad.

251
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:37,172
He was so focused
on saving the world

252
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:39,090
and doing his duty...
don't laugh...

253
00:11:39,092 --> 00:11:41,259
that he never had time for us.

254
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:42,794
Dad was under a lot
of pressure.

255
00:11:42,796 --> 00:11:45,230
He always had time
for you, though,

256
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:47,766
his precious little airbender.

257
00:11:47,768 --> 00:11:50,402
Dad loved us all equally.

258
00:11:50,404 --> 00:11:53,188
Besides, it all happened
a long time ago.

259
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,806
Why are we even talking
about this?

260
00:11:54,808 --> 00:11:57,826
Because you seem to have
some grandiose delusion

261
00:11:57,828 --> 00:12:00,579
that we had a perfect,
happy-go-lucky childhood.

262
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:02,313
Guess what.
We didn't.

263
00:12:02,315 --> 00:12:03,582
We need to keep moving

264
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:05,367
if we want to find ikki
before dark.

265
00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:07,202
See what he's doing
there, Bumi?

266
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:09,821
Classic airbender technique.

267
00:12:09,823 --> 00:12:11,673
Cutting and running
when things get tough!

268
00:12:11,675 --> 00:12:12,791
Ugh.

269
00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:14,092
Yeah.
Did dad teach you that move?

270
00:12:19,164 --> 00:12:20,882
How was your day, sweetie?

271
00:12:20,884 --> 00:12:22,550
Oh, fabulous.

272
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:23,852
My tribe's about to go to war,

273
00:12:23,854 --> 00:12:25,220
and I'm supposed to stop it,

274
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:26,938
but will anyone listen to me?

275
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,641
No! And I didn't ask
for my father's help.

276
00:12:29,643 --> 00:12:31,860
Can't he just let me be
the Avatar?

277
00:12:31,862 --> 00:12:34,312
Uh, do you want advice,

278
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:36,180
or am I just supposed
to listen?

279
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:37,782
I'm still not clear on that.

280
00:12:37,784 --> 00:12:40,869
Ugh. I'm sorry.

281
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:42,904
My dad just gets me
all worked up.

282
00:12:42,906 --> 00:12:44,956
How about you take a break
from all this Avatar stuff,

283
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,992
and we go out
for a quiet dinner?

284
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:48,243
Just the two of us.

285
00:12:54,584 --> 00:12:56,801
Isn't this fun, huh?

286
00:12:56,803 --> 00:12:59,404
We never get to spend
enough time together,

287
00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:02,440
just the five of us.

288
00:13:02,442 --> 00:13:05,010
So fun.

289
00:13:05,012 --> 00:13:07,946
Excuse us while we retrieve
more sustenance.

290
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:13,768
You guys gotta save me.

291
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,854
I thought you were
breaking up with her.

292
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:17,605
What happened
to ripping off the leech?

293
00:13:17,607 --> 00:13:18,857
I tried!

294
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:20,075
But anytime I bring up
the subject,

295
00:13:20,077 --> 00:13:21,743
she threatens to freeze me
in a block of ice

296
00:13:21,745 --> 00:13:24,279
and feed me
to dolphin-piranhas!

297
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:26,114
So it was more like
you tugged at the leech.

298
00:13:26,116 --> 00:13:29,334
Yes, over and over and over,
but it won't come off.

299
00:13:29,336 --> 00:13:31,235
Why didn't you warn me
your cousin had the power

300
00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:32,737
to reach into my heart
and crush my soul

301
00:13:32,739 --> 00:13:34,205
with her bare hands?

302
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:36,791
Uh, 'cause I thought
it was pretty obvious.

303
00:13:36,793 --> 00:13:38,009
No, no, not to me, it wasn't.

304
00:13:38,011 --> 00:13:39,427
I'm very bad at reading people.

305
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:41,379
You should know that by now.

306
00:13:41,381 --> 00:13:43,748
Oh, man.

307
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,100
Oh!

308
00:13:45,102 --> 00:13:47,802
Do something, Avatar!

309
00:13:47,804 --> 00:13:49,253
You know, this reminds me

310
00:13:49,255 --> 00:13:50,588
of a search-and-rescue
mission

311
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,640
I commanded years ago,

312
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:55,226
in the mountains
outside of ba sing se.

313
00:13:55,228 --> 00:13:56,811
Here we go.

314
00:13:56,813 --> 00:14:00,598
For five days, we scoured
that beast of a Mountain,

315
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,601
fighting our way
through blizzards, sandstorms,

316
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:05,987
and three typhoons.

317
00:14:05,989 --> 00:14:07,939
Finally, we found the men
huddled in a cave,

318
00:14:07,941 --> 00:14:09,491
seconds from death.

319
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:11,376
With no time to lose,

320
00:14:11,378 --> 00:14:14,829
I piled all 12 of those
poor souls on my back

321
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:17,665
and single-handedly
carried them

322
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,667
down the Mountain to safety.

323
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:23,121
And how exactly is that
supposed to help us find ikki?

324
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:25,757
It was supposed to inspire you.

325
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,127
Clearly, you know nothing
about being a leader of men.

326
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:31,963
That's probably why
the Avatar fired you.

327
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:34,482
I'm sick
of your far-fetched tales.

328
00:14:34,484 --> 00:14:36,134
Three typhoons?

329
00:14:36,136 --> 00:14:38,770
Well, I may have thrown in
an extra typhoon or two

330
00:14:38,772 --> 00:14:40,638
for dramatic effect, but...

331
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,657
quit arguing and bring
that lantern over here.

332
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:45,610
I found footprints!

333
00:14:48,313 --> 00:14:50,982
- Come on!
- No, follow me!

334
00:14:50,984 --> 00:14:55,503
This will get us down
50 times faster.

335
00:14:55,505 --> 00:14:58,039
Bumi, it's pitch black,
and the rocks are slippery.

336
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,157
You're gonna hurt yourself.

337
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,209
Come on, you wimps!

338
00:15:01,211 --> 00:15:03,461
If I can do it,
it should be no problem

339
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:04,929
for a couple of benders.

340
00:15:04,931 --> 00:15:06,848
Fine.

341
00:15:18,562 --> 00:15:21,946
You were right, Bumi!
That was faster!

342
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:25,033
At least 50 times faster,
by my calculations.

343
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,155
Oh, Tenzin's the funny guy now.

344
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:32,991
If you need an airlift down,
just say the word.

345
00:15:32,993 --> 00:15:34,709
Bah, I don't need your help.

346
00:15:34,711 --> 00:15:36,377
I've got everything
under control.

347
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:37,378
Agh!

348
00:15:40,383 --> 00:15:43,334
Bumi!

349
00:15:48,924 --> 00:15:50,809
Did dad send you to talk to me?

350
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:52,594
Your father doesn't know
I'm here.

351
00:15:52,596 --> 00:15:54,929
Korra, what's going on
between you two?

352
00:15:54,931 --> 00:15:56,397
Ask dad.

353
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,100
I've tried,
but he won't talk about it.

354
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:01,736
Honey, it breaks my heart
to see our family

355
00:16:01,738 --> 00:16:03,404
being torn apart like this.

356
00:16:03,406 --> 00:16:05,723
You want to know
what's been going on?

357
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:07,742
I found out dad's
been lying to me

358
00:16:07,744 --> 00:16:09,611
my whole life.

359
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:11,062
Unalaq told me everything...

360
00:16:11,064 --> 00:16:13,331
how dad and Tenzin
kept me trapped down here

361
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,616
while I trained,

362
00:16:14,618 --> 00:16:18,036
how dad got banished
from the north.

363
00:16:18,038 --> 00:16:20,238
So the truth is out.

364
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,006
You knew.

365
00:16:22,008 --> 00:16:23,741
And you never said anything.

366
00:16:23,743 --> 00:16:26,261
We were trying to keep
our family together,

367
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:28,012
to give you a normal childhood.

368
00:16:28,014 --> 00:16:31,015
I never wanted
a normal childhood.

369
00:16:31,017 --> 00:16:33,768
All I ever wanted to be
was the Avatar.

370
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,253
But everyone keeps
holding me back,

371
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:36,471
even my own parents!

372
00:16:36,473 --> 00:16:38,640
Unalaq's the only one
who believes in me.

373
00:16:38,642 --> 00:16:40,225
That's not true, Korra.

374
00:16:40,227 --> 00:16:42,310
No? Then why is everyone
in the South

375
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:43,945
turning against me,
when all I'm trying to do

376
00:16:43,947 --> 00:16:45,113
is help them?

377
00:16:45,115 --> 00:16:46,931
The problems between the north
and the South

378
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:49,100
started long before you
were born.

379
00:16:49,102 --> 00:16:51,452
You can't expect to undo them
in a day.

380
00:16:51,454 --> 00:16:53,037
So I should just sit back

381
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:55,039
and let the water tribes
go to war?

382
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:58,576
No, but this situation
might be out of your control.

383
00:16:58,578 --> 00:17:01,546
Varrick's been plotting
a rebellion against Unalaq.

384
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:03,464
He asked your father
to join, and...

385
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:05,116
dad is part of a rebellion?

386
00:17:05,118 --> 00:17:06,751
I don't know,
but I don't want you

387
00:17:06,753 --> 00:17:08,052
getting caught
in the middle of it.

388
00:17:08,054 --> 00:17:09,470
It's too late, mom.

389
00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:12,423
I'm already
in the middle of it.

390
00:17:15,294 --> 00:17:18,229
Korra!

391
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:25,153
Uncle!

392
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:27,322
Oh, no.

393
00:17:27,324 --> 00:17:28,489
Uncle?

394
00:17:38,084 --> 00:17:41,002
Dad?

395
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:47,183
Dad, don't do this.

396
00:17:47,185 --> 00:17:48,885
Turn around, Avatar,

397
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:50,387
and pretend you didn't see
anything.

398
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:53,390
No. Leave Unalaq and go.

399
00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:55,508
I'll tell him I tried
to stop you, but you escaped.

400
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,176
We can still avoid a war.

401
00:17:57,178 --> 00:18:00,363
No, we can't.

402
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:17,964
Get him out of here!

403
00:18:19,334 --> 00:18:21,084
We're all part
of the same tribe.

404
00:18:21,086 --> 00:18:24,037
I don't want to hurt you.

405
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:51,566
Oof!

406
00:18:55,504 --> 00:18:58,421
Dad, stop!

407
00:19:07,131 --> 00:19:09,599
Why did you do this, dad?

408
00:19:12,854 --> 00:19:16,106
What? Who are you?
Where's my father?

409
00:19:16,108 --> 00:19:17,724
He wouldn't help us.

410
00:19:17,726 --> 00:19:22,362
He's a traitor, just like you.

411
00:19:27,818 --> 00:19:29,285
Thank you for saving my life.

412
00:19:29,287 --> 00:19:32,122
I'm just glad
I got here in time.

413
00:19:32,124 --> 00:19:33,790
Find Varrick.

414
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:35,625
I want him to freeze in prison
with the rest

415
00:19:35,627 --> 00:19:39,278
of these traitors.

416
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,047
Wait, you can't just lock
them away.

417
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:42,799
That will only make
the South angrier.

418
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:44,667
You want them to go free?

419
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:46,119
No.

420
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:49,172
But let them stand trial
for what they did.

421
00:19:49,174 --> 00:19:53,726
Every water tribe citizen
deserves that right.

422
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:55,261
Very well.

423
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,964
I will respect the Avatar's
wishes in this matter.

424
00:19:57,966 --> 00:20:00,683
Thank you, Uncle.

425
00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:02,519
I told you
those rocks were slippery.

426
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:04,237
You're lucky
you didn't kill yourself.

427
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:06,022
You done with the lecture, mom?

428
00:20:06,024 --> 00:20:08,158
Oh, grow up.

429
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,743
You haven't changed one bit
since we were kids.

430
00:20:10,745 --> 00:20:11,995
You're still trying to prove

431
00:20:11,997 --> 00:20:13,663
you can do everything
a bender can.

432
00:20:13,665 --> 00:20:15,748
Well, you can't.
Deal with it.

433
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,700
And you're not our mother.

434
00:20:17,702 --> 00:20:21,087
You don't get to tell me
what I can and can't do.

435
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:22,989
Deal with that.
Ugh!

436
00:20:22,991 --> 00:20:24,541
Good luck healing yourself

437
00:20:24,543 --> 00:20:26,626
with your special
non-bending powers.

438
00:20:26,628 --> 00:20:28,511
Hey, back me up here, Tenzin.

439
00:20:28,513 --> 00:20:30,163
Kya's right.

440
00:20:30,165 --> 00:20:31,464
You're the oldest of us,

441
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:33,332
but you always acted
like the youngest.

442
00:20:33,334 --> 00:20:35,518
I had to become
the responsible one.

443
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,022
You think you're
the responsible one?

444
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:41,691
Where were you after dad died
and mom was all alone?

445
00:20:41,693 --> 00:20:44,444
Because I was the only one
who packed up and moved

446
00:20:44,446 --> 00:20:46,312
my whole life to be with her.

447
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:48,231
Sure, after years
of flitting around the world,

448
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:50,483
trying to find yourself.

449
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:52,785
It was time for you
to settle down somewhere.

450
00:20:52,787 --> 00:20:55,238
You two have no idea
how it feels to have the future

451
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,523
of an entire culture
on your shoulders.

452
00:20:57,525 --> 00:20:58,741
Oh, boo-hoo.

453
00:20:58,743 --> 00:21:00,410
Must've been real hard for you,

454
00:21:00,412 --> 00:21:01,878
flying around the world
with dad,

455
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,580
riding elephant-koi all day.

456
00:21:03,582 --> 00:21:05,999
Oh, so that's what this
is all about.

457
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:08,384
That's what it's always
been about.

458
00:21:08,386 --> 00:21:10,203
You think you're some savior

459
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:12,505
who has to carry on
dad's legacy.

460
00:21:12,507 --> 00:21:13,873
Who else is going to do it?

461
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,258
How about all of us?

462
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,810
Yeah, we're Aang's kids too.

463
00:21:17,812 --> 00:21:19,979
We never should have come
on this vacation.

464
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:21,931
I couldn't agree more.

465
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:24,234
Well, I didn't want you
to come in the first place.

466
00:21:24,236 --> 00:21:26,519
I can't be around you two
right now.

467
00:21:26,521 --> 00:21:28,888
Go back to the temple
and see if ikki returned.

468
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,056
I'll keep looking out here.

469
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:31,491
- Fine.
- Fine.

470
00:21:31,493 --> 00:21:34,577
Fine.

471
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,627
Is it okay if I come in?

472
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:52,962
Of course.
We heard what happened.

473
00:21:52,964 --> 00:21:54,747
Are you okay?

474
00:21:59,754 --> 00:22:01,721
I'm so glad you weren't there.

475
00:22:01,723 --> 00:22:03,056
I don't know
what I would have done.

476
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:07,260
I had no idea how far Varrick
was willing to go.

477
00:22:07,262 --> 00:22:08,778
My brother and I
have our differences,

478
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,947
but I would never attack him.

479
00:22:10,949 --> 00:22:13,066
I'm sorry for thinking
you had anything to do

480
00:22:13,068 --> 00:22:14,284
with the rebels,

481
00:22:14,286 --> 00:22:16,536
and for all the pain
I've caused you and mom.

482
00:22:16,538 --> 00:22:18,371
I'm the one
who should apologize.

483
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:20,290
After I saw
the Southern lights return,

484
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:21,958
I was so proud of you.

485
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,777
I never should have held
you back.

486
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:26,963
When your father and I
found each other,

487
00:22:26,965 --> 00:22:28,881
all we wanted was to live
a simple life

488
00:22:28,883 --> 00:22:30,883
and raise a family.

489
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:33,419
But then we discovered
you were the Avatar,

490
00:22:33,421 --> 00:22:35,288
and simple was over.

491
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,674
We knew one day
the world would need you,

492
00:22:37,676 --> 00:22:39,458
and you wouldn't need us
anymore.

493
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,395
Mom, dad,
of course I still need you.

494
00:22:47,184 --> 00:22:48,467
We weren't expecting you.

495
00:22:48,469 --> 00:22:51,154
Tonraq, Senna,
you are under arrest

496
00:22:51,156 --> 00:22:52,305
and will stand trial.

497
00:22:52,307 --> 00:22:54,140
Trial? For what?

498
00:22:54,142 --> 00:22:56,476
For conspiring
to assassinate me.

499
00:22:59,182 --> 00:23:02,919
