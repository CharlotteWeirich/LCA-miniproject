eventually its charge will die.

Congratulations.
After weeks of stalking Shard,

00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:01,461
you've unlocked the secret
of when they dump their garbage.

16
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:03,797
Can total victory be far behind?

17
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:07,567
I'm not hearing any better ideas
coming out of your talk hole, Red.

18
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:09,536
Hold on.
We're repairing the ship

19
00:01:09,604 --> 00:01:12,238
so we can use the ultrawarp
and bring reinforcements from Oa.

20
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:15,208
While we're waiting,
I'm gathering as much intel as I can

or letting the Red Lanterns know

22
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:19,679
we didn't die when they
blew up that planet.

23
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,415
Let me tell you
what Atrocitus would do.

24
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:24,317
He'd come after you relentlessly.

25
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:28,889
He'd keep coming until you were dead,
even if it meant his own death.

26
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:32,626
I was a fool to join you.

Soon I'll be as useless as you two.

aren't willing to die for your cause.

Negative. You must have

Technically, you are a prisoner.
Now please return to the ship.

I do not want your actions to be
misunderstood by the others.

- Heh. Misunderstood?
- I know you are not evil.

Then you don't know me at all.

anything on this bucket work?

We're not floating,
so we have internal gravity.

I was captured by the Green Lanterns.

But it was only a matter of time
before I gained their trust.

75
00:04:55,874 --> 00:04:58,575
Then I blew up their ship.

You did well, Razer.

00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,317

by your side.

To do this!

your true intentions?

What you received
was a mere light show.

Now tell me, what have you
really been doing all this time?

See? I told you
he was a lost cause.

And I say good riddance.

85
00:05:49,193 --> 00:05:51,862
Who knows? Maybe he was
planning this the whole time!

86
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,532
If that were true, why didn't he
just kill us when he had the chance?

87
00:05:57,201 --> 00:06:00,804
Instead, he took the time
to create a very convincing diversion.

88
00:06:00,872 --> 00:06:04,041
Agreed. The program
is nearly undetectable.

89
00:06:04,108 --> 00:06:07,077
My subsystems are studying
how it works even now.

90
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:09,546
My bet is he went to settle
his score with Atrocitus.

91
00:06:09,614 --> 00:06:11,875
Then he should have made
funeral arrangements,

92
00:06:11,876 --> 00:06:13,383
'cause that's a one -way ticket.

93
00:06:13,451 --> 00:06:17,154
And he knows it, which is
why we have to stop him.

Of all your stupid ideas,
Jordan, this one wins the prize!

00:06:41,145 --> 00:06:45,082
to power his interrogation.
He doesn't deserve this.

I'm cleric Loran.

Lucky for you,

00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:04,014
Cleric Loran, it's been a
long time since I've been here.

134
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:08,485
I'd love to hear the story behind
these beautiful stained-glass windows.

Of course, my angry child.

136
00:10:13,491 --> 00:10:18,061
The city represents the capital of
Ysmault before the guardians arrived,

137
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:22,966
but it would be any city on a thousand
worlds in our now-ravaged galaxy.

138
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:26,837
And then the guardians
descended upon us.

139
00:10:26,904 --> 00:10:29,873
They said they would bring
peace and order,

140
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:34,477
but as the book of rage tells us,
lies tumbled from their mouths.

141
00:10:34,545 --> 00:10:37,681
They said, "kneel before us,
and you will want for nothing."

142
00:10:37,748 --> 00:10:40,317
but we would not worship them,

143
00:10:40,384 --> 00:10:42,686
and their wrath was
deep and terrible.

144
00:10:42,753 --> 00:10:46,022
The blue devils unleashed
their automaton manhunters,

145
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:50,093
and the guardians' soulless
avengers snuffed out every life,

and stilling every heart.

It was his holy hate that bore

Oh, boy.

to become a truly hateful creature,
