What is it, already?

152
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:35,482
It's a single atom of Jumbonium.

153
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:40,209
An element so rare the nucleus alone
is worth more than $50,000.

154
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:42,324
- How much more?
- 1 00,000.

155
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:45,001
That's why I hid it
under my mattress.

Why certainly.

158
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:52,766
The atom sits atop
this dime-store tiara...

...to be awarded to the winner
of the Miss Universe Pageant.

When I was a little girl,
I dreamed of being Miss Universe.
