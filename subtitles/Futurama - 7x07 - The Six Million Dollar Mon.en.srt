00:00:20,164 --> 00:00:22,198
people, as company bureaucrat,

4
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:26,102
I will today be conducting
the annual performance review.

5
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,538
With a twist.

6
00:00:28,606 --> 00:00:29,739
(All gasp)

7
00:00:29,807 --> 00:00:31,775
Oh, no.
The firing tie.

8
00:00:31,843 --> 00:00:33,977
Correct. I will be evaluating
each of you,

9
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:37,481
and the lowest-rated employee,
possibly Zoidberg,

10
00:00:37,548 --> 00:00:39,649
will be fired at sundown.
Zoidberg.

11
00:00:39,717 --> 00:00:42,619
(Laughs) Classic Hermes.

12
00:00:42,687 --> 00:00:44,754
Let the interviews begin.

13
00:00:44,822 --> 00:00:46,656
Good luck,
everybody but Zoidberg.

14
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:49,926
My primary duties?

15
00:00:49,994 --> 00:00:52,161
Well, I assist the Professor
in whatever important research

16
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:54,564
he happens to be engaged in.

17
00:00:54,632 --> 00:00:56,399
(Snoring)

18
00:00:56,467 --> 00:00:59,669
Uh, yes, sir, I will be sure

19
00:00:59,737 --> 00:01:03,239
to snore that science lamp
right away.

20
00:01:03,307 --> 00:01:05,842
(Snores)

21
00:01:10,314 --> 00:01:12,048
Now, Leela,
couldn't we just fire you

22
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:13,883
and have Fry or Bender
fly the ship?

23
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:17,586
Not if you stand on their
air hose much longer.

24
00:01:17,654 --> 00:01:18,821
Noted.

25
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:21,157
(Air hisses)

26
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:22,303
(Both scream)

27
00:01:22,423 --> 00:01:23,278
My job?

28
00:01:23,398 --> 00:01:25,995
Toilets 'n' boilers,
boilers 'n' toilets.

29
00:01:26,063 --> 00:01:28,197
Plus that one boiling toilet.

30
00:01:28,265 --> 00:01:30,733
Fire me iffen you dare.

31
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:38,122
Now, then, while many
of you do half-ass jobs

32
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:40,609
and the rest do jobs
whose ass ratio ranges

33
00:01:40,677 --> 00:01:43,947
from 42% to a mere 11%,
only the most

34
00:01:44,014 --> 00:01:46,782
pathetically useless employee
will be fired today.

35
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,952
And that employee is...

36
00:01:50,854 --> 00:01:51,900
Hermes Conrad.

37
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,557
What?! No way! Hermes, no!

38
00:01:54,624 --> 00:01:57,526
Yes. My performance review
proves the main drag

39
00:01:57,594 --> 00:02:01,030
on our profit is the time
I waste on performance reviews.

40
00:02:01,098 --> 00:02:02,631
But you can't fire yourself now.

41
00:02:02,699 --> 00:02:04,304
We were just getting
to know each other.

42
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,436
I've already notified
the central bureaucracy.

43
00:02:06,503 --> 00:02:07,703
(Doorbell rings)

44
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:09,939
They'll be here two seconds ago.

45
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:13,277
I suppose you're here
to tell me to pack it in?

46
00:02:13,397 --> 00:02:16,312
Only if you buy me
dinner first.

47
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,512
(All laugh)

48
00:02:18,632 --> 00:02:19,803
I'm being fired.

49
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:22,785
I don't think it's appropriate
to joke around like that.

50
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:23,735
You're right, Hermes.

51
00:02:23,855 --> 00:02:25,721
Meet mark 7-G,

52
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:27,464
the machine who's replacing you.

53
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:30,926
I'm mark 7-G, the machine
who's replacing you.

54
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:33,250
(Sighs) Will you be
conducting an exit interview?

55
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:35,744
Well, I wouldn't say no

56
00:02:35,812 --> 00:02:37,412
to a little
friendly debriefing.

57
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,581
(All laugh)

58
00:02:39,649 --> 00:02:41,850
Bureaucrat Conrad,
you are ordered

59
00:02:41,918 --> 00:02:43,351
to relieve yourself of duty.

60
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:45,554
Sounds like a party.

61
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:47,789
(All laugh)

62
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:50,224
Good-bye.

63
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:53,027

64
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:01,603
(Computer whirs, buzzes)

65
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:03,104
Well, this is it.

66
00:03:03,172 --> 00:03:04,773
But I want you
to know working here

67
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:07,108
has been the experience
of a lifetime.

68
00:03:07,176 --> 00:03:09,077
Off you go.

69
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:15,083
So, I hear you're a machine...
ow! Traitor!

70
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,886
My friend's ample tuchus
is barely out the door,

71
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:20,489
and you're already schmoozing
up to his replacement?

72
00:03:20,556 --> 00:03:21,957
Um, Zoidberg?

73
00:03:22,024 --> 00:03:23,658
I don't think Hermes
really liked you.

74
00:03:23,726 --> 00:03:26,895
In fact, he hated you more
than anyone ever hated anyone.

75
00:03:26,963 --> 00:03:29,130
What, you mean the remarks
and the hits?

76
00:03:29,198 --> 00:03:30,899
That was just friend teasing.

77
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:32,133
Oy.

78
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:33,602
You don't understand.

79
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:36,404
He was the only one
who cared enough to insult me.

80
00:03:36,472 --> 00:03:38,473
I insult you, you fat sack.

81
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,609
Sure, when it's convenient.

82
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:42,577
But Hermes
was always there for me.

83
00:03:42,645 --> 00:03:44,012
And now he's gone,

84
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:47,816
thanks to you,
Mr. bigshot 7-G.

85
00:03:47,884 --> 00:03:52,020
(Sniffles)
I'll never see Hermes again.

86
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:56,157
On the bright side,

87
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:57,792
I'll never see Zoidberg again.

88
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,161
Aw, there, there, husband.

89
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:02,531
I made your favorite,
curried goat.

90
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:04,132
It better be spicy.

91
00:04:06,536 --> 00:04:09,270
(Sizzles)

92
00:04:14,577 --> 00:04:16,645
Well played.

93
00:04:18,213 --> 00:04:20,515
Ows.

94
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,884
(Robots screaming)

95
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:26,287
Ah. Fire.

96
00:04:26,355 --> 00:04:29,558
Aah! It burns! It burns!

97
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,226
Hmm, not bad.

98
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:34,062
Needs a little hot sauce.

99
00:04:37,934 --> 00:04:40,401
(Sighs) I just don't know
how we'll get by.

100
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:42,303
Then I guess this
wouldn't be a good time

101
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:43,638
to tell you that I'm pregnant.

102
00:04:43,706 --> 00:04:45,006
What?!

103
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:47,141
And you're not the father. No!

104
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:50,478
(Laughs)
I'm just joking, husband.

105
00:04:50,546 --> 00:04:53,481
See now? Things don't seem
so bad any more, do they?

106
00:04:53,549 --> 00:04:55,516
You're right.
Thank you, Labarbara.

107
00:04:55,585 --> 00:04:57,886
Oh, also, I wrecked the car.

108
00:04:57,954 --> 00:05:00,354
(Both gasp)
This here is a mugging!

109
00:05:00,422 --> 00:05:01,756
Hand over your skin.

110
00:05:01,824 --> 00:05:03,191
My ebony splendor?

111
00:05:03,258 --> 00:05:04,559
Me don't think so.

112
00:05:04,627 --> 00:05:07,028
I said hand it over.
I'm hungry!

113
00:05:07,096 --> 00:05:09,163
Ha-haw! Ha-haw!

114
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:10,699
(Both gasping)

115
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:12,567
For God's sake, woman,
just give him your skin!

116
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:14,002
Can't you see he's crazy?!

117
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,505
You calling me cra... zy?!

118
00:05:17,573 --> 00:05:19,440
Ain't nothing crazy about me
but my brain.

119
00:05:19,508 --> 00:05:20,709
Right, brain?

120
00:05:20,776 --> 00:05:23,111
Right!
No, not you, right brain.

121
00:05:23,178 --> 00:05:25,080
Right, left brain?
Right!

122
00:05:25,147 --> 00:05:27,115
Okay, then. Ha-haw!

123
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:28,850
Do something, Hermes.

124
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:31,185
I can't!
When I fight machinery,

125
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:32,687
machinery always wins!

126
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:35,624
Officer:
Freeze, bagwad.

127
00:05:35,691 --> 00:05:37,926
(Robot screams)

128
00:05:37,994 --> 00:05:40,862
You're under arrest for
attempted epidermicide.

129
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,198
I'm coming for you, man.
Ain't no jail can hold me.

130
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:46,034
That's why
you're going straight

131
00:05:46,102 --> 00:05:48,036
to the electromagnetic chair.

132
00:05:48,104 --> 00:05:51,439
And then I'm-a stab it.
Ha-haw!

133
00:05:54,644 --> 00:05:56,210
(Siren wails)

134
00:05:58,213 --> 00:05:59,547
(Magnets hum)

135
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:03,484
S-s-stop!
It's driving me sane!

136
00:06:03,552 --> 00:06:05,887
(Screaming)

137
00:06:09,224 --> 00:06:10,291
Hey, Bender,

138
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:12,160
you should become
an executioner.

139
00:06:12,227 --> 00:06:14,495
You could kill humans
and wear a cool hood.

140
00:06:14,563 --> 00:06:17,498
Nah, I like my victims to
know who did it. Psst!

141
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:20,802
Hermes! Boy, am I indifferent
to see you.

142
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,337
We need to
talk... alone.

143
00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:25,774
Okay, Hermes. Sure.

144
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:32,013
Fry, could you come in here

145
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:34,082
and help me rub on this
new scented body oil?

146
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,084
In a second.
I'm eavesdropping.

147
00:06:36,152 --> 00:06:37,585
Please, Fry?

148
00:06:37,653 --> 00:06:40,088
Leela punishes me
when I don't use enough.

149
00:06:40,156 --> 00:06:41,990
I said not now!

150
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:44,159
Sure, I know a guy.

151
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:49,197
(Siren wails, dog howls)

152
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:55,828
Yuri here runs
the most sanitary

153
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,306
surgical implant parlor
in Filthytown.

154
00:06:58,373 --> 00:07:00,441
So, I hear you're an expert in

155
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:02,543
the shadowy field
of "body augmentation".

156
00:07:02,611 --> 00:07:05,646
I am expert in shadowy field
of many things.

157
00:07:05,715 --> 00:07:07,816
I need something that'll make me
less inferior

158
00:07:07,883 --> 00:07:10,484
to today's modern machinery.
Can you help me?

159
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:13,121
No problem.
I prepare operating room.

160
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:15,389
(Cat yowls)

161
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,661
Hermes:
Oh, honey, I'm home!

162
00:07:23,032 --> 00:07:24,165
Pops?!

163
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:26,000
Is that a harpoon
in your chest?

164
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:28,669
Yes. And I'm happy to see you.

165
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:32,207
Mmm...

166
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:40,907
And the best part is,
the whole package fits neatly

167
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:42,975
in the space
where my giblets used to be.

168
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:44,476
I'm kind of a harpoon snob,

169
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:47,646
and let me say,
that thing is gorgeous.

170
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:49,682
But do you really need
chest artillery?

171
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:51,417
It's not just a weapon.

172
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:53,853
It's the bureaucrat's
best friend. Observe.

173
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:55,754
(Sing-songy):
Oh, mark 7-g?

174
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:58,157
Would you mind
fetching that carton

175
00:07:58,225 --> 00:08:00,293
from the top shelf?

176
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:04,330
(Grunting)

177
00:08:04,397 --> 00:08:06,498
(Laughs) Pitiful and sickening.

178
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:08,201
Okay, little man,

179
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:10,870
let a professional bureaucrat
show you how it's done.

180
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:17,009
My best wasn't good enough.

181
00:08:17,077 --> 00:08:19,979
I'll need my personnel
file, please.

182
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:25,284
Welcome back, old friend.

183
00:08:25,352 --> 00:08:27,153
I missed you terribly.

184
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:28,855
You do everything terribly.

185
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:30,622
And I'm not your friend.

186
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,860
(Laughs) Good old Hermes.

187
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:36,729
When he stops insulting,
that's when I worry.

188
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:38,331
Oh, dear!

189
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:41,567
I was leaning over the sink
eating pureed clams

190
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:45,071
when my teeth fell
in the disposal.

191
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:47,706
Scruffy, could you
retrieve them?

192
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:50,743
'Taint a boiler
nor a toilet. Pass.

193
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,479
(Sighs)
I'll fetch my hand tools.

194
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:57,516
Hand tools? Why don't you get an
extendo-arm implant, like mine?

195
00:08:57,584 --> 00:09:01,187
(Whirring)

196
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:02,634
Oh, no.
No more implants.

197
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:05,824
I don't want to end up a cold,
emotionless machine like you.

198
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:07,193
That's sweet, Hermes.

199
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:09,695
Maybe I should get
an extendo-arm.

200
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:18,905
How long will it take to
install an extendo-arm?

201
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:22,775
I have golf game in half-hour,
so... half-hour.

202
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,516
(Grunts)

203
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,418
(Garbled):
Thank you, Hermes.

204
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:35,021
I don't know.
It seems like a lot of trouble

205
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:37,589
to cut off your arm
just to snake a drain.

206
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:39,225
Ah-ah-ah, it's not
just a drain snake.

207
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:42,194
It comes with a set
of interchangeable accessories.

208
00:09:42,262 --> 00:09:43,195
Jackhammer...

209
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:45,697
Vegetable peeler...

210
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:47,366
Pipe-bending jig.

211
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:49,435
A machine that can bend?
No way.

212
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:51,770
But, Hermes, old friend,
didn't you say

213
00:09:51,838 --> 00:09:54,106
you were through
with the implants?

214
00:09:54,174 --> 00:09:56,242
Oh, don't be such a spoilsport.

215
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,210
Such a mild insult.

216
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:01,147
That's not my Hermes.
Speaking of...

217
00:10:01,214 --> 00:10:03,715
What happened to your
cutoff body parts anyhow?

218
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:04,817
Right here.

219
00:10:06,553 --> 00:10:08,754
I was going to donate them
to the salvation air force,

220
00:10:08,822 --> 00:10:10,289
but they're starting to rot.

221
00:10:10,357 --> 00:10:11,991
Then I'll just take
them and, uh,

222
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:14,293
throw them away,
shall I why not?

223
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:17,596
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo,
whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo! Nyah-ah-ah.

224
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:24,736
So, friend, welcome to my home.

225
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:26,105
I'm very proud of it.

226
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:28,474
But I want to hear
what you think.

227
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:32,478
"Oh, mon, I'm Hermes,
and I think it stinks in here

228
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:35,414
like a green snake, or
something else that's Jamaican."

229
00:10:35,482 --> 00:10:39,151
(Laughs)
Good one at my expense, Hermes.

230
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:46,192
Mmm, well, I must
admit it's not bad.

231
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:48,294
And it will cut
two or three hours a day

232
00:10:48,362 --> 00:10:49,661
off my cornrowing routine.

233
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:53,032
Yes, our lives
will never be the same.

234
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,367
Darn it!

235
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:55,868
I'll be right back.

236
00:10:57,104 --> 00:10:59,038
(Snoring)

237
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,773
Ooh!

238
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:03,675
Hermes, oh, you foolish man,

239
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:06,012
what do you need
a cylon eye for?

240
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,014
Now, calm down, dear.

241
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:11,783
You know, you look
even hotter in infrared.

242
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:15,854
(Moaning, smooching)

243
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:17,156
(Whirring)

244
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:18,824
Aah!

245
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:21,827
Husband, some things were
not meant to be cylonned.

246
00:11:21,895 --> 00:11:23,329
Now, you must promise me

247
00:11:23,397 --> 00:11:25,697
you won't be getting
any more upgrades.

248
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:27,166
I promise.

249
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:33,705
(Oohing and aahing)

250
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:34,973
Wow.

251
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:44,550
Nice, shiny metal ass, Hermes.

252
00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:46,919
(Grunts, stammers)

253
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:48,921
So, with all these implants,
what exactly

254
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:51,490
is the difference
between you and a robot?

255
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:54,427
I still have one thing no
robot shall ever have...

256
00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:57,663
a good old flesh-and-
blood human brain.

257
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,932
Yes, a big, smart brain.

258
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:03,202
Not like dum-dum Zoidberg,
right, Hermes? Right?

259
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,605
Mecha-Hermes has no interest
in such nonsense.

260
00:12:10,277 --> 00:12:15,381
Uh, Mr. Conrad, did you remember
to save the trimmings for me?

261
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:17,283
Yes, yes, doctor.
Right here.

262
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,185
(Squealing)

263
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:24,756
Wait. You're not eating my
discarded flesh, are you?

264
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:27,093
How could you even
ask such a thing?

265
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,362
Of course, I tried eating you,
but your flesh was too spicy.

266
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,099
Thanks to years of Labarbara's
curried goat, no doubt.

267
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:36,068
But my mecha-stomach
has no need of goat.

268
00:12:36,136 --> 00:12:38,804
Mecha-Hermes has spoken!

269
00:12:38,871 --> 00:12:40,406
Mecha-Hermes still
wants to know

270
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:42,208
what you're doing
with his pieces.

271
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:45,111
Something wonderful.

272
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:47,713
Florp:
<i>Give it way up</i>

273
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,216
for Dr. Zoidberg
and little Hermes.

274
00:12:50,283 --> 00:12:51,650
(Cheering and applause)

275
00:12:51,718 --> 00:12:53,051
Hello. Hello.

276
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:56,722
So, little Hermes,

277
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:59,291
did you hear
I've taken up running?

278
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:01,227
"Yeah, from restaurant
to restaurant.

279
00:13:01,294 --> 00:13:02,628
Ho ho, mon."

280
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:04,597
(Audience laughing)

281
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,501
"Seriously, though,
have you lost weight?"

282
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:09,801
Yes.

283
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:11,670
"Looks like you found it again."

284
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:12,938
(Laughs)

285
00:13:13,006 --> 00:13:14,273
(Audience laughing)

286
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:15,741
Oh, boy.

287
00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:17,743
That was quite a zinger,
old friend.

288
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,478
"I'm not your friend.

289
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:22,148
I'm out of here the second
you let go of my bowels."

290
00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:23,415
(Audience laughing)

291
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:25,584
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

292
00:13:25,652 --> 00:13:27,119
I'll be here all week.

293
00:13:27,187 --> 00:13:29,421
"You've been warned, people."

294
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:31,023
(Laughs) He's good.

295
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,959
I can only see one of his
four mouth-tendrils moving.

296
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:36,928
So, Mr. Conrad, did
you enjoy the show?

297
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:38,430
Alas, no.

298
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:41,433
Seeing what I once was
filled me with regret.

299
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:44,002
You could always
undo your implants.

300
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,505
Regret that I still
have one human part.

301
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:48,974
That meat puppet disgusts me.

302
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:51,943
It's time for
the ultimate upgrade.

303
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:54,780
But the only thing you
haven't upgraded is your brain.

304
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:56,215
Exactly.

305
00:13:56,283 --> 00:13:58,350
(All gasping)

306
00:13:58,418 --> 00:14:00,986
Oops. (Gasps)

307
00:14:01,054 --> 00:14:03,489
Robot brain implant? Never.

308
00:14:03,557 --> 00:14:06,058
No one in right mind
would do that.

309
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,360
(Laughing wildly)

310
00:14:18,605 --> 00:14:21,073
Ah, a freshly dug robot grave.

311
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,409
Let's exhume-a-zoom-zoom.

312
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:25,177
Step aside.

313
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,051
Bing-reka!

314
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,587
The brain circuit.

315
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:35,854
Come, fellows.

316
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:37,523
Let's go home and install it.

317
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:39,525
Enjoy eternity
without your brain,

318
00:14:39,593 --> 00:14:41,193
anonymous dead robot.

319
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:43,262
(Bender chuckling)

320
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,697
(Wind howling)

321
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:54,696
(Electrical buzzing)

322
00:14:54,764 --> 00:14:59,033
So, little Hermes, are you ready
to watch some brain surgery?

323
00:14:59,101 --> 00:15:02,337
"I'm ready to shoot myself
if it'll get me off your lap."

324
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:04,272
(Laughing)

325
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,940
Open the dome

326
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:09,177
and unleash the power
of the heavens!

327
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:13,047
(Clanking)

328
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:17,452
(Birds chirping)

329
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:25,092
Ah, now I can see
what I'm doing.

330
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,429
Commence the operation!

331
00:15:27,496 --> 00:15:29,897
Labarbara:
Terminate the operation.

332
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:31,566
Labarbara? Dwight?

333
00:15:31,634 --> 00:15:34,469
I just got an urgent text
from little Hermes.

334
00:15:34,537 --> 00:15:36,204
You can't do this thing.

335
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:38,406
You don't even know
whose brain that is.

336
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:39,641
It doesn't matter.

337
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:41,543
Any robot brain
will improve my fitness

338
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,077
as a husband and father.

339
00:15:43,145 --> 00:15:45,112
You can't be a
husband and father

340
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,449
if you don't have
a wife and son.

341
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:49,116
Wait.

342
00:15:49,184 --> 00:15:51,619
I care about you
too much to lose you.

343
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:54,322
But my new robot brain won't.

344
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,091
Commence the operation.
(All gasping)

345
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,593
Well you'll have to commence it

346
00:15:58,661 --> 00:15:59,828
without me, Hermes.

347
00:15:59,895 --> 00:16:01,796
And commence living without me.

348
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:04,766
Because I will commence
divorce proceedings.

349
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:07,635
Oh, I hope to God
I'm using that word correctly.

350
00:16:10,873 --> 00:16:13,341
Oh, I can't do this, Hermes.

351
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:15,810
Your wife's moving plea
has made me realize

352
00:16:15,878 --> 00:16:18,446
you might have
litigious survivors.

353
00:16:18,514 --> 00:16:20,014
Oh, thank you, Professor.

354
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:22,283
Come now. Let's go try
that Korean noodle place

355
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:23,685
you were telling me about.

356
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:29,524
There will be no noodles until
the operation is complete.

357
00:16:30,593 --> 00:16:32,159
(Whirring)

358
00:16:35,865 --> 00:16:38,266
You can't force me to operate.

359
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,002
Maybe not, but perhaps
I can encourage you

360
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:43,538
with my encouragement drill.

361
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:48,175
Zoidberg:
Wait.

362
00:16:48,243 --> 00:16:49,844
I'll perform the surgery.

363
00:16:49,912 --> 00:16:52,313
You? With those clumsy claws?

364
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:53,815
It's true, old friend.

365
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:57,285
My claws are too clumsy
for such delicate work.

366
00:16:57,352 --> 00:16:59,153
"But mine aren't."

367
00:17:00,556 --> 00:17:03,224
You, mon, give me
that robot brain.

368
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:05,460
And you, metal guy, lie down.

369
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:07,395
Zoidberg, this makes no sense.

370
00:17:07,463 --> 00:17:08,863
Why are you helping him?
(Drumbeat playing)

371
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:10,164
And what's that catchy beat?

372
00:17:10,232 --> 00:17:11,833
I'll tell you.

Does anyone else find it freaky

388
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:49,070
that Zoidberg is singing
harmony with himself?

389
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:51,405
Oh, loosen up, Amy.

390
00:17:51,474 --> 00:17:53,374
My condolences, Labarbara.

391
00:17:53,442 --> 00:17:55,242
I hope you find some comfort

392
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,446
in staring at this throbbing
mass of nerve tissue.

393
00:17:58,514 --> 00:18:01,415
(Sobbing):
Oh, he's gone!

394
00:18:01,484 --> 00:18:03,785
Oh, Zoidberg, what
have you done?

395
00:18:03,853 --> 00:18:05,787
I'll tell you what I've done.

396
00:18:05,855 --> 00:18:08,523
I've brought your husband back.

397
00:18:08,591 --> 00:18:10,291
(Slurps)

398
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:20,535
(All gasping) Pops.

399
00:18:20,603 --> 00:18:23,404
Sweet reawakenin'...
Of me, a Jamaican-in.

400
00:18:23,472 --> 00:18:24,873
Hermes, you're alive.

401
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,774
And practically rhyming.

402
00:18:28,143 --> 00:18:30,879
Wife, son, I am so sorry.

403
00:18:30,946 --> 00:18:32,780
Once I started
upgrading myself,

404
00:18:32,848 --> 00:18:34,649
I lost all control.

405
00:18:34,717 --> 00:18:36,317
But I see now

406
00:18:36,385 --> 00:18:39,387
that if you can't be man enough
with your own parts,

407
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:41,656
no amount of machinery
will help.

408
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:47,729
Not so fast.

409
00:18:47,796 --> 00:18:49,163
(All gasping)

410
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:51,265
But faster than that!

411
00:18:57,139 --> 00:18:59,440
It's that insane
robot, Roberto.

412
00:18:59,508 --> 00:19:01,108
(All screaming)

413
00:19:01,176 --> 00:19:03,745
Quick, Hermes, the keys.

414
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:05,947
I left them in my other body.

415
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:07,348
Oh, yeah.

416
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,116
And I'm-a stick 'em
in your pancreas

417
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:11,252
till I find one that opens it.
(Laughs)

418
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:14,088
(Frightened yelping)

419
00:19:19,194 --> 00:19:20,361
(Roberto yelling ŕ LA Tarzan)

420
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:23,031
(All screaming)

421
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:26,968
I'm gonna peel off your skin
and eat it like pencil shavings.

422
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:28,202
(Gasps)

423
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,871
Ow!

424
00:19:29,939 --> 00:19:32,206
Thank God Zoidberg
didn't reattach my nerves.

425
00:19:34,877 --> 00:19:36,678
Mmm, that's tasty.

426
00:19:36,745 --> 00:19:38,613
Too tasty.

427
00:19:38,681 --> 00:19:40,014
(Whimpers)

428
00:19:40,082 --> 00:19:42,684
It burns. It... it burns!

429
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:44,118
(Screaming)

430
00:19:44,186 --> 00:19:45,352
What's happening?

431
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,821
The spicy curried goat.

432
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:48,823
Hermes' skin is so
saturated with it

433
00:19:48,891 --> 00:19:50,858
that it's dissolving
the bad robot.

434
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,531
In the end, all his implants

435
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,568
were no match for my wife's
reckless seasoning.

436
00:20:00,636 --> 00:20:03,504
Now, husband, don't you
think you owe Zoidberg

437
00:20:03,572 --> 00:20:07,341
a thank-you for saving
you from yourself?

438
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:08,643
But I hate him.

439
00:20:08,711 --> 00:20:10,044
Honey, we all do.

440
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:12,046
But fair is fair.

441
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:14,682
(Clears throat)

442
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,185
Zoidberg, I... I know we
have never been friends,

443
00:20:18,253 --> 00:20:20,822
but I appreciate what you did.

444
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:22,323
Thank you.

445
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,260
Never been friends?

446
00:20:26,328 --> 00:20:28,696
Ouch! What a zinger.

447
00:20:28,764 --> 00:20:32,000
Well, here's one for you,
Mr. not-my-friend Conrad.

(Grunts)

449
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:34,769
You acted like a big jerk.

450
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:37,204
You were selfish and stupid,
and you don't deserve

451
00:20:37,272 --> 00:20:39,841
a wife like Labarbara
or a friend like me.

452
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:41,609
(Laughing)

453
00:20:41,677 --> 00:20:43,945
It's funny because it's mean.

454
00:20:44,013 --> 00:20:45,680
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

455
