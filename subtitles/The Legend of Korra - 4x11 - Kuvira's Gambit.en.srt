1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,000
Earth

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,950
Fire

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,600
Air

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,400
Water

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,100
Only the Avatar can master all four elements
...

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,300
And bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:19,975 --> 00:00:21,975
Bolin, Opal and Lin
rescued the Beifong

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,600
And Zhu Li Kuvira.

9
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,975
Now rushing to Republic City
want to warn all

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,150
About the impending attack
Earth Empire.

11
00:00:28,175 --> 00:00:31,475
Meanwhile, the Avatar team
preparing for such an event.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,850
The Prince Wu is leading
the evacuation plan.

13
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,575
Asami and Varrick are creating
flying mecca-suits.

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,750
But as Kuvira plans
attack within 2 weeks.

15
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:40,175
Is there time?

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,000
BALANCE BOOK 4 CHAPTER 11
"The KUVIRA OF ruse"

17
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,350
Today, we will
to the story.

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,000
Over the past three years, we fought side by side

19
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:56,775
To unify the Empire Earth.

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,000
E
proved that no one can stand against us.

21
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,150
Not even the Avatar.

22
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,150
But our mission
is not over.

23
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,850
There is a great injustice that must be corrected
.

24
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,525
As you know,
after the War of the Hundred years

25
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,750
The Avatar Aang and Fire Lord, Lord Zuko
,

26
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,550
Stolen lands of the Earth Empire

27
00:01:16,575 --> 00:01:18,575
And founded the United Republic.

28
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,100
These lands belong
to the Empire Earth.

29
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,350
It's time to get them back.

30
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,100
Republic City
will be ours!

31
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,200
Long live the Great Unifying!

32
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,150
Are you ready to show
than the super weapon is capable of?

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,050
I am. It will be an honor
march through the city at your side.

34
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,050
I love you, Kuvira.

35
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,550
I could never
this without your help.

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,250
After clamoring victory

37
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:50,475
Finally we can get married
and rule the Empire together.

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,850
How is the course
evacuation?

39
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,825
Could be better.
Already evacuated nearly...

40
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,725
- 18 families.
- Only 18?

41
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,525
There are millions of people
in this city.

42
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,050
He said he could be going better.

43
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:08,300
The problem is that
evacuation is voluntary.

44
00:02:08,325 --> 00:02:10,000
And there are not many
volunteers.

45
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:12,325
The population does not feel
no imminent danger.

46
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,300
Guys, great!
They're all here.

47
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:17,025
What is the idea of stopping
all my meetings?

48
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,050
Su?

49
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:20,025
What...
Are you well.

50
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,450
I'm sorry for Zaofu.

51
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
- How did you escaped?
- Opal, Beifong and I

52
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,325
Rescued everyone.
But we flee from Kuvira.

53
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,700
We have seen the super spiritual weapon
closely.

54
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,475
Type... Very close.
Very close to it.

55
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,450
She will use it against
Republic City?

56
00:02:34,475 --> 00:02:38,075
Yes, I found that it will attack
within two weeks.

57
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,450
The Zhu Li is on our side now.
In fact, always been,

58
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:43,925
And I'll let her explain everything.
Zhu Li?

59
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,050
Intended to be loyal to Kuvira
to sabotage the weapon.

60
00:02:48,075 --> 00:02:51,275
He went well.
But I know their plans.

61
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,275
I knew she was not going to stop
in Zaofu.

62
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,150
I suppose
come by way of the railroad.

63
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,500
It is the only way to transport
that gun.

64
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:59,025
So let's cut
lines.

65
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,400
I agree.
We evacuate as many people as possible.

66
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:05,325
Communicate the radio. Now
evacuation is mandatory.

67
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
We'll treat it.

68
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,100
Do not worry, Mr. President
,

69
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,075
Not let Kuvira
take our city.

70
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,250
Faster!
Time is running!

71
00:03:20,275 --> 00:03:23,025
We have just two weeks to have these costumes

72
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,050
Working.

73
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,300
Varrick, thankfully,
you're here!

74
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,800
- Can we talk for a minute?
- What is it? I'm busy

75
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:32,425
To inspire my employees.

76
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,850
Well, I went to Zaofu,
save Su and her family

77
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,650
And guess whom we met?

78
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,850
- Zhu Li?
- There is not anything you wanna say?

79
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,200
Please
let me speak first.

80
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:51,525
I know I said terrible things
thee ahead of Kuvira.

81
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,950
But I want you to know I did not mean any of it
.

82
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,100
When was caught
thought the only way

83
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,875
Save you
was joining me to it.

84
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,375
Every day
dreamed to see you again

85
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,000
And tell you the truth.

86
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,500
Varrick, significas
everything to me.

87
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,650
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
anyway.

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,100
Do not be so hard on yourself
.

89
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,200
Apology accepted.

90
00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:20,225
Now, be a good assistant
and starts working.

91
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:23,125
Do not!
I am no longer your assistant!

92
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,275
If I want to close by

93
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,400
Raisins to treat me
as equals.

94
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,800
We are connected to the emergency broadcast.

95
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:40,925
Will you speak for all the radios
city.

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,225
Attention, citizens of Republic City.

97
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,600
This is not a test.

98
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,650
An attack to our town
is imminent.

99
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,900
The President Raiko ordered
all citizens to evacuate.

100
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:55,625
Open the book evacuation
subsection 1.26

101
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,350
There will find the instructions for your neighborhood.

102
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,275
For example, if you live in northwestern sector
1

103
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,450
Look at our primary location

104
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:07,325
What is the library entry
Water Tribe.

105
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,900
Then elect a leader
as stated in Subsection 1:28

106
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,625
Chief?
No one is to understand nothing.

107
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,650
I think the Mako
is creating panic.

108
00:05:17,675 --> 00:05:20,975
What is it confusing?
I'm being very specific.

109
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,025
Great!
That's all we need.

110
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,350
I solve this.

111
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,150
Hello, everyone.
Here is the Prince Wu.

112
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,550
I know you're scared.

113
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:33,275
Believe me,
I know what it is to be scared.

114
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,800
I could not go to the bathroom alone.

115
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,450
But if we let the fear
take care of us,

116
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,300
None of us will be able to go to the bathroom.

117
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:42,875
So, we will all be losers
.

118
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,900
But the citizens of Republic City

119
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:47,075
Are no losers!
We are winners!

120
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,550
Winners who will leave this town

121
00:05:49,575 --> 00:05:51,475
Calmly and order.

122
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,650
I want to pick up
in your families,

123
00:05:53,675 --> 00:05:54,775
Pick up in your neighbors

124
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,150
Catch that homeless
that not know...

125
00:05:57,175 --> 00:06:00,175
And enter a
any available means of locomotion.

126
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,100
Let's get them out of here!

127
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,400
Safe and sound.

128
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,000
Good job, kid.

129
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,850
Maybe it's not a bad king,
the end of the day.

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,350
Rohan is with others.

131
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,225
They've got a boat
ready to go.

132
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,050
Why have not packed their bags
?

133
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,150
The kids and I talked,
and decided that we will stay.

134
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,650
This is our town
and we need all the help possible.

135
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,950
That's right!
Face the domain of air in your faces!

136
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,100
Thank you.

137
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,700
Prince Wu
should need you

138
00:06:37,725 --> 00:06:38,725
For evacuation.

139
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,650
And the three of you help them
other air rulers

140
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:43,025
Keep the troops of the Empire
away.

141
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,850
The Kuvira will repent of the day
that stirred the Meelo!

142
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,350
Do not feel good to leave
my office.

143
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:36,000
The Air Temple Island
is the ideal location for your base.

144
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,450
E will be safe here.

145
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:39,425
There's something I want to discuss with you
.

146
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,050
- What is it?
- We talked and...

147
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,325
We want to destroy the super weapon Kuvira

148
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,100
Before you approach
city.

149
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,225
This is a risk
we do not need to run.

150
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,600
The evacuation is already underway.
And General Iroh is ready.

151
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,700
I know Iroh can handle the same
to-toe against Kuvira,

152
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,700
- But that gun...
- is very powerful.

153
00:07:57,725 --> 00:08:00,625
- Can destroy the city.
- Do not we let get here.

154
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,400
Let's try to go behind enemy lines
and destroy the weapon.

155
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:05,825
If it works,
will save us on the battlefield.

156
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,150
- But if they are caught...
- It's worth the risk.

157
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,600
I agree.

158
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,825
Our best weapon can be
avoid this war.

159
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,900
- Good luck.
- We leave tonight.

160
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,200
Is there anything out there.

161
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,000
It is the Kuvira Army.

162
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:32,525
Are one week earlier.

163
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,250
Warns the commander.
And alert Republic City.

164
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,100
Personally, I see something!
Down there.

165
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,650
- What's that?
- Kuvira.

166
00:09:13,675 --> 00:09:16,025
It is already in the territory of the United Republic
.

167
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,950
- It is early one week.
- This makes no sense.

168
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,000
There is no train line
here.

169
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,450
How does it carried
that super weapon?

170
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,750
Apparently
a giant Mecca-costume.

171
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,900
Did you know that Kuvira
was building this thing?

172
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:46,825
Does forgot to mention?
Of course I did not know!

173
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,100
There is a flying bison
nearby.

174
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,100
A Avatar.

175
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,650
I know what happens next!
We have to leave now!

176
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:12,675
Now!

177
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,100
We must go after them?
They will warn Republic City.

178
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,150
Let them go.
No one can stop us.

179
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,800
Korra, are you okay?

180
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:53,325
Why did you come back so soon?

181
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,525
It Kuvira. Our information
was wrong.

182
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,600
She should know that Zhu Li
on to say.

183
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,675
- What do you mean?
- The army of Kuvira

184
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,475
- It is just a few hours.
- It can not be.

185
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,650
- We are not prepared.
- And the super weapon

186
00:11:04,675 --> 00:11:06,425
Is connected to a giant Mecca-costume.

187
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,600
It's the size of a building
25 floors.

188
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,600
Contact the General Iroh and tell him
that the attack will take place today.

189
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,100
- We need to lock the city.
- Pema, is the Wu

190
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,425
And tell him we need to evacuate
immediately.

191
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,300
We can not lose
innocent lives.

192
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:20,725
- What do we do?
- Come to my factory

193
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,450
Maybe some costume
ready for use.

194
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:24,875
Let's you.

195
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,950
I go to the front line
warn the General Iroh.

196
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,000
Kuvira,
this is President Raiko.

197
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,875
I order you to retreat.

198
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,000
Get in his army
and turn around.

199
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:45,775
Not in
position to give orders.

200
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,650
Step back or attack.

201
00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:50,525
I think it has no concept of the
power I possess.

202
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,450
Let me show you.

203
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,850
It is because of this that would not
construct the weapon.

204
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,800
Mr. President,
we are waiting for your orders.

205
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,550
Has 3/2,
or make disappear your army.

206
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,000
- I have no choice.
- The time is over!

207
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,100
Stop!
We surrender ourselves.

208
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,300
Republic City is yours.

209
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,900
Good.

210
00:13:56,925 --> 00:13:59,525
Give me your army and Avatar

211
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,450
And tells Baatar
its location.

212
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:03,675
It will introduce you to the
our conditions.

213
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,850
I will not surrender.

214
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,875
Back to city
before she sees you.

215
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,300
And Korra...

216
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,250
Find a way to overthrow it.

217
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll find out.

218
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,950
There, Kuvira.

219
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,450
I'm meeting with the Raiko
on Air Temple Island.

220
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,900
On my way.

221
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,500
Raiko surrendered.

222
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,000
It's up to us now.

223
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:30,900
How do we fight against an army
,

224
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:33,125
A giant Mecca-costume
and that crazy gun?

225
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,800
We can not fight,
but maybe we can sabotage it.

226
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,750
Zhu Li,
when you were spying on Kuvira,

227
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:40,025
Did you know anything about that
giant monster?

228
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,150
I did not know they were
to build it.

229
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:45,175
It seems that Baatar Jr.
is better than I thought.

230
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,250
Do not say you
I said that.

231
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,200
That's it! Baatar Jr. built it.
He knows how to destroy it.

232
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,725
I say that we must capture
and make him talk.

233
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,850
I know it's a long shot.
But it's the only chance we have.

234
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,100
- If not...
- Korra. Align.

235
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,300
We need rulers air to enter discreetly

236
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:06,475
The airship Baatar.

237
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,900
Tenzin, Bumi, Jinora, Kai,
go.

238
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,850
- What about me?
- Sorry, kid.

239
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,100
It's mission requires
maximum silence.

240
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,650
And I'm not much
such.

241
00:15:19,675 --> 00:15:21,175
I can be silent!

242
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,650
Okay.
Note noted.

243
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,550
Is everyone ready?

244
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,100
Made a terrible mistake.

245
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,300
When Kuvira discover that disappeared
,

246
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:50,075
- You are finished.
- So before it discover

247
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,400
're Going to tell us how to stop
that mecca Giant

248
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:54,725
- Or not...
- Otherwise what?

249
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,650
You will not hurt me.

250
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,750
I know that is an empty threat
when I see one.

251
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,450
It was this, your better idea?

252
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,550
Lost.

253
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,500
Just have not yet accepted it.

254
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,100
Let me talk to him.

255
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,150
- You sure?
- Did you check it?

256
00:17:52,175 --> 00:17:54,075
What is happening?
It's all right?

257
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,000
Just a minute, sir.
I'm saying, I checked everything.

258
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,850
Okay!
Enough gossip.

259
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,025
I am ready to discuss the conditions

260
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,975
With Baatar Jr.,
where is he?

261
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,850
In fact,
I'm not sure.

262
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,250
- Baatar?
- If you think I'm going

263
00:18:11,275 --> 00:18:13,475
Tell you my secrets, mother...

264
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,750
- You are terribly mistaken.
- Why are you doing this?

265
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,400
I know planeavas
help the world

266
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:20,675
But this is crazy.

267
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,000
Madness is to let others
take what is yours

268
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:24,525
And accept blindly.

269
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,500
The United Republic
belongs to us.

270
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,850
- And we'll take it back.
- At what cost?

271
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,800
How many people will need to die
Kuvira be satisfied?

272
00:18:34,825 --> 00:18:38,825
You do not have to cost any life
to surrender.

273
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,300
Whatever Kuvira and I want
is to unite the Empire Earth.

274
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,850
I do not know what it was that made
to hurt you.

275
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,900
But whatever it is,
I am very sorry.

276
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,750
When you left Zaofu,
broke my heart.

277
00:18:52,775 --> 00:18:55,275
And our family
never been the same since.

278
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,700
Please Baatar, stop it
and back home.

279
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,100
We want you back with us
.

280
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,300
Kuvira now is my family.

281
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,600
Understand all wrong.

282
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,050
You're right.

283
00:19:13,075 --> 00:19:15,325
I will physically hurt you
if not speak.

284
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,950
But there is one thing I can do
What is even more painful.

285
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,150
I'll take what you
more you care this life

286
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,350
Kuvira.

287
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,700
- What do you mean?
- The Kuvira can even win

288
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,000
Can even take this city

289
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,400
But thou shalt not
enjoy the victory.

290
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,150
Because wherever I go,
I'm taking you with me.

291
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,700
I make it my mission in life.

292
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:39,475
I never allow you to see your loved one again
.

293
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,650
If you take this city is better than losing
Kuvira forever?

294
00:19:42,675 --> 00:19:44,625
- You can not.
- I can.

295
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,300
Unless convenças the Kuvira
to retreat.

296
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,850
We will continue with the Empire Earth.

297
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,475
Just let the United Republic
alone.

298
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,550
It Kuvira.
She wants to talk to the Baatar.

299
00:20:04,575 --> 00:20:05,975
What should I tell you?

300
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,800
For God's sake,
give me that radio,

301
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,250
Let me talk to her.

302
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,450
Kuvira, here is the Raiko.

303
00:20:14,475 --> 00:20:16,275
What kind of trap
is up to?

304
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,850
You said you were going to send the Baatar
with thy borders,

305
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,275
And now
it does not appear.

306
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,250
What do you mean,
"it does not appear"?

307
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:24,875
According to your staff,
it is not in the airship.

308
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,100
If he is not in the airship,
where is he?

309
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,700
Kuvira, is Baatar.
I was captured.

310
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,850
My airship was ambushed
and was taken by force.

311
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,175
Korra refuses to release me, let's descend unless

312
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,500
And leave the city.

313
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:41,925
- Are you hurt?
- I am fine.

314
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,750
- The Avatar is with you now?
- Yeah, they're all here.

315
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,000
Find out where is this signal
is coming.

316
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,350
Listen to me...

317
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,550
If you take Republic City

318
00:20:53,575 --> 00:20:55,975
The Avatar
never let me see you again.

319
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,200
And I refuse to live
that way.

320
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,950
Forget the United Republic,
already have the Empire Earth.

321
00:21:01,975 --> 00:21:03,275
We fear each other.

322
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
Let's go home and get married
.

323
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,500
The only thing that matters is
be together forever.

324
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,700
We have already identified the position.

325
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,800
You're right.

326
00:21:14,825 --> 00:21:17,725
This town is not worth the risk
to sacrifice our future.

327
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,700
I love you, Baatar.

328
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,350
So we make an agreement with Kuvira,

329
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,675
We'll release it here.

330
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,450
Guys, she discovered
our location.

331
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
You're pointing a gun at us
.

332
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,425
No. It would not.

333
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,350
Everybody out. Already.
Now!

334
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,050
- No
-. Keep safe chairman.

335
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
I'm going to look for survivors.
