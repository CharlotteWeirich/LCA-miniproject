00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,885
Ba-bum.

[Aaravos]<i> Long ago, Xadia was one land...</i>

00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:37,787

[Sol Regem growls]

00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,937
[sniffs]

9
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,356
I smell death.

10
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:10,820
Is that why you summoned me here?
So you could insult me?

11
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:18,119
You and all your followers must give up
Dark Magic, immediately and forever.

12
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,955
It is humanity's only path forward.

13
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,708
It's a path backward.

14
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,585
You just expect humans to go back

15
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,379
to the way things were
before we had magic?

16
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:32,717
When humans starved and struggled,
helpless and pathetic?

17
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:36,221
Back to a time when we were lesser beings?

18
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,225
You are lesser beings.

19
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,101
You are arrogant!

20
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:48,316
Hmm. Lay down your staff and walk away.

21
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:54,030
Lay it down? But it was a gift.
That would be rude.

22
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,909
- A gift?
- Of course.

23
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,620
You didn't think
that a lesser being like myself

24
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,790
would be able to craft
such a powerful relic?

25
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,293
Who gave you the staff?

26
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,423
- [angrily] Who?
- One of the great ones.

27
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,175
[roars]

28
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,971
You... You promised my safety
if I came here!

29
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:23,434
Yes, you will be
safe high upon this peak...

30
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:28,273
far, far away from the city of Elarion.

31
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:32,485
You can't be saying... an entire city?

32
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,864
Hundreds of thousands of innocent people!
Children!

33
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:40,702
Give up Dark Magic
or I will reduce it to ash!

34
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,787
You wouldn't.

35
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,080
[huffs]

36
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,253

[Sol Regem growls softly]

44
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,895
[Rayla] That's no ordinary dragon.

45
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,398
[Callum] Is there such a thing
as an ordinary dragon?

46
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,317
His name is Sol Regem, the Sun King.

47
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,696
He was the king of the dragons
a long time ago.

48
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,823
But he was blinded when the wars began,

49
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,826
and he's become a symbol of rage
and bitterness.

50
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,870
[Callum] Okay, so, an enormous,
angry, blind dragon

51
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,331
is blocking our path to Xadia.
What do we do?

52
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,834
[chuckles] Well, we can't fight him,

53
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,169
seeing as you've just got
your cute blow spell,

54
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,547
and my swords aren't fit to be
his toothpicks.

55
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,593
[gasps] We'll have to sneak past him!

56
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,222
Callum, it's time for you
to get your first lesson

57
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,641
- in the ways of stealth.
- Nice!

58
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,726
I... I mean...

59
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,810
[quietly] Nice.

60
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,981
The secret of stealth
is that you don't have to be invisible.

61
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,109
You just have to be invisible
to your enemy's senses.

62
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,487
Well, he's blind, so we don't need
to worry about his sense of sight.

63
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:26,868
Exactly. That leaves only two senses
we need to fool, hearing and smell.

64
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,788
Wait, why are those the only two senses
we need to worry about?

65
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,709
Well, if it gets to his sense of touch,
we're in big trouble.

66
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,044
And sense of taste?

67
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,212
- [roars]
- [Rayla] Nice knowing you.

68
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,297
Got it.

69
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,424
All this stuff about senses
and appearances,

70
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,676
it kind of sounds like Moon Arcanum stuff.

71
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,680
- If you say so, mage.
- [Zym chirps]

72
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,560
[soldier] General Amaya,
we're running out of time.

73
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:56,731
I strongly recommend we gather
the battalion and abandon the fortress.

74
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,275
General!

75
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:02,779
General, the Sunfire elves
have already taken over the outpost

76
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,530
on the Xadian side of the Breach.

77
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,742
<i>If the elves mount an attack,</i>

78
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,787
<i>we simply don't have the numbers
to hold this fortress.</i>

79
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,372
When the elves mount an attack.

80
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,217
General Amaya, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but someone has arrived.

81
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,095
[roars]

00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,436
- [Zym whining]
- Come on, Callum, try to keep him quiet.

84
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,647
I know, it's just... [sighs]

85
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,775
Ez would know how to calm you down,
wouldn't he?

86
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,778
We just need to trust each other, okay?

87
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,154
- I've got you.
- [whimpers]

88
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,923
[Sol Regem growling softly]

[Callum screams]

101
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,706
What now? [panting]

102
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,219
[Gren laughs and grunts]

103
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,018
[laughs]

104
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,981
I'm sorry to interrupt,

105
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,483
but where are the reinforcements
we requested?

106
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,027
We sent many messages to Lord Viren.

107
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,656
No reinforcements are coming.

108
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,826
Lord Viren has been arrested for treason.

109
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,458
"Lieutenant, you're right.
We can't defend the Breach.

110
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,460
But I won't abandon it.

111
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,840
Our only choice is to destroy it."

112
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,346
[growls]

113
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,101
- [Callum] Do we run for it?
- We'll never make it.

114
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:05,146
He'll just bite us in half
or slam us with his tail.

115
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:09,942
So, sneaking is out, running is out,
fighting is out. What's left?

116
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,403
- Burning to death?
- Definitely out.

117
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,779
[growls]

118
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,283
[sighs]

119
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:21,746
Looks like it's down to my least favorite
course of action. [sighs]

120
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,624
- Reason.
- [Callum groans]

121
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:30,004
Mighty Sol Regem,
I am Rayla of the Moonshadow elves.

122
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,343
[sniffs]

123
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,931
- [Sol Regem] What are you doing?
- Uh...

124
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:45,436
- I am bowing, great dragon.
- No.

125
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,315
I mean, why are you here?

126
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,486
We have been traveling
in the human kingdoms

127
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,739
on the business of Zubeia,
the Dragon Queen.

128
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:00,451
We humbly ask your permission
to cross back into Xadia.

129
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:08,209
What kind of business would send you
to the wretched human lands?

130
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,797
We are transporting something precious,
someone precious.

131
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,466
The new-born Dragon Prince, Azymondias!

132
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:21,472
Lies! You dare lie to me?

133
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:25,142
- The egg of the Dragon King was destroyed!
- [Zym whimpers]

134
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,562
No! Wait! I have him here.

135
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,898
[Zym whining loudly]

136
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,987
The Dragon Prince lives!
And he's very cute, isn't he?

137
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,614
- There's a good boy!
- [chirps]

138
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,535
[sniffs]

139
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,456
- How is this possible?
- It is a miracle.

140
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,708
He needs to go back to his home.

141
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,919
Please, allow us to pass,

142
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:55,214
so we can reunite the Dragon Prince
with his mother.

143
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:04,682
I do not understand how the Dragon Prince
came to be in the human lands.

144
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,394
However, I will allow you

145
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,730
and the dragonling to pass
back into Xadia.

146
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:17,278
But not the filthy human
who cowers nearby.

147
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,989
- [Callum sighs]
- [Rayla] Sol Regem...

148
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:25,286
- [Callum] It's okay. You go on without me.
- No! Callum, we're so close.

149
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,747
Rayla, getting Zym to Xadia
is all that matters.

150
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:33,544
Just tell the Dragon Queen
I helped a little. I'll go back home.

151
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,504
[Sol Regem chuckling]

152
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,511
Home? No.

153
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,722
There are two choices.

154
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,099
You all die,

155
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:51,770
or just the wretched, evil human dies.

156
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:54,690
[Zym whimpers]

157
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:59,445
I agree with you, Sol Regem.
Some humans are evil.

158
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:03,532
- Uh, Rayla...
- But not this one. Not Callum.

159
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,119
The only reason the Dragon Prince is alive
is because of this human.

160
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,164
He left his home and his family
to save the egg,

161
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:14,835
and he sacrificed everything
so Azymondias could be born.

162
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,754
He's noble and true.

163
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,633
When we met,
he could have had me captured or killed.

164
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:25,471
But he didn't, because without knowing me
or anything about me,

165
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:29,475
he saw past human hatred
and did what he knew was right.

166
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,603
He's smart and kind and brave, and he's...

167
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,854
my friend.

168
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,564
My best friend.

169
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:47,368
So, please, allow him to pass into Xadia
and help me take the Dragon Prince home.

170
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:50,371
Because I don't think
I can do it without him.

171
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,709
[sniffs]

172
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,380
I smell death!

173
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,091
What? No, Callum is different.

174
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,177
I smell the reek of Dark Magic on him.

175
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,221
He's no different.

176
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:11,100
He rips the life
and magic out of innocent creatures.

177
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,936
He must die.

178
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,158
The cable.

179
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,669
"It's done. Let's go."

180
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,512
[soldier] On your command, we'll pull
the cable and detonate the barrels.

181
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:53,767
"And a thousand tons of rock
and lava will seal the Breach forever."

00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,731
[roars]

183
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,737
I'm sorry, Rayla.

184
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,116
But if me dying is the only way for you
and Zym to get across safely,

185
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,953
- then it's time for me to face the end.
- Calm down.

186
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,957
He can't use his fire breath yet.
He can only do it every few minutes.

187
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,168
He needs time to recharge.

188
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:25,257
Wait. We can't hide from his senses,
but maybe we can trick them.

189
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,759
Create a false appearance.

190
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:30,804
After all, we can only truly know
the appearance itself.

191
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:35,142
- Now you're sounding like Lujanne.
- Wow, really?

192
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,771
- That wasn't a compliment.
- Here's the idea.

193
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,690
<i>I could use </i>Aspiro<i> to blow my scent
to a different place.</i>

194
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,485
<i>Like... like ventriloquism,
but with smells!</i>

195
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,579
- Smelltriloquism!
- Uh...

196
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,042
- Vensmelloquism.
- It's a stupid idea.

197
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,295
But there might be something to it.

198
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,965
Time is up!

199
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,176
Give me your scarf!

200
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,346
If I wear it, I'll smell like you,
and I'll draw his fire.

201
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:16,183
Once he uses his blast, you and Zym
make a run for it while I keep him busy.

202
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:20,020
This is the worst idea you've ever had.
He's gonna burn you to a crisp.

203
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:24,191
- [Sol Regem roars]
- No, he won't. I'm faster than him.

204
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,443
And besides,
it's the only chance we've got.

205
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,572
I haven't bathed in two weeks.
This should do the trick.

Here goes nothing.

We're ready to detonate
the explosives on your command.

212
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,736
Pull!

213
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,137
Now what? The trigger's been disabled.

But, Amaya, you won't survive.
