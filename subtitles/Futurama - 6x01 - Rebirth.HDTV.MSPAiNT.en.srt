1
00:00:04,617 --> 00:00:08,302
On the count of three, you will awaken
feeling refreshed, as if

2
00:00:08,732 --> 00:00:13,979
Futurama had never been cancelled by idiots,
then brought back by bigger idiots.

3
00:00:14,527 --> 00:00:15,727
One

4
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:17,033
Two

5
00:00:25,464 --> 00:00:27,899
Professor, my Fry-fro is all frizzy.

6
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:29,844
Okay.
-Well, that's all.

7
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,801
Oh also, I'm covered with severe burns.

8
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:34,663
So? What of it?

9
00:00:34,749 --> 00:00:37,359
Well.. Why is... those things?

10
00:00:38,402 --> 00:00:40,208
You mean you don't remember?

11
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:43,067
Nope. Nothing. It's like I passed out in college,

12
00:00:43,147 --> 00:00:45,898
except no one drew magic-marker penises on my forehead.

13
00:00:46,635 --> 00:00:48,522
Well, I suppose it's for the best.

14
00:00:48,823 --> 00:00:51,803
Considering the unbearable horrors you've endured.

15
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:53,804
Let's never speak of it again.

16
00:00:54,412 --> 00:00:56,508
It all began a few days ago.

17
00:00:57,086 --> 00:01:00,861
We were interstellar fugitives
on the run from the law.

18
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,877
Fire all weapons and open a hailing
frequency for my victory yodle.

19
00:01:17,848 --> 00:01:23,348
And so, as you and Leela kissed goodbye
in a tender display of tonguesmanship,

20
00:01:23,853 --> 00:01:26,439
We plunged into a massive wormhole.

21
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:28,886
Never to be seen again.

22
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,475
Yeah, we're back.

23
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,718
Sweet coincidence of port-au-prince,
we're back at earth!

24
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,950
Of course!
That was the Panama wormhole!

25
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,589
Earth's central channel for shipping!

26
00:01:46,764 --> 00:01:51,311
How humorous.
-Yes, it's sort of a comedy central channel.

27
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:53,092
And we're on it now!

28
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:55,193
I get it!

29
00:02:06,134 --> 00:02:09,321
We've lost power to the forward gameboy.
Mario not responding!

30
00:02:09,622 --> 00:02:11,170
Brace for emergency landing.

31
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,290
Roger that. Activate safety-spheres!

32
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,092
Also mine has airconditioning.

33
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:46,067
Yet thanks to my trusty safety-sphere,
I sublibed with only trivial braindabglid.

34
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:49,884
And the others?
-Right here behind this horrorcloth.

35
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:53,583
Are they dead?
-No, no, no, no. Much worse.

36
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:22,898
Subbed by: Daealis

37
00:03:31,952 --> 00:03:35,593
Move over god!
Prepare for rebirth.

38
00:03:38,555 --> 00:03:39,913
Wrong switch.

39
00:03:49,444 --> 00:03:54,048
Come on stem cells, work your
astounding scientific nonsense.

40
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:57,234
Fetal stem cells? Aren't those controversial?

41
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,182
In your time yes, but nowadays

42
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:01,172
SHUT UP.

43
00:04:01,248 --> 00:04:05,765
Besides, these are adult stem cells,
harvested from perfectly healthy adults

44
00:04:05,965 --> 00:04:08,538
Whom I killed for their stem cells.

45
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:20,664
Hermes Conrad!

46
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,546
O' man, I'm dripping with placenta.
Good thing it's casual friday.

47
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,417
Amy Wong!

48
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:37,940
Ooh, baby soft!
-Indeed.

49
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:40,781
Dr. Zoidberg!

50
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:45,395
Hermes, my friend! Let me cut off your
umbilical cord.

51
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:50,273
And the rest!

52
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:52,534
Hooray! We're back in bussiness.

53
00:04:52,713 --> 00:04:54,875
Over my dead body.

54
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,140
Eh, nevermind.

55
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:04,376
Bender, are the stem cells working?

56
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:13,394
I'm dying. I need mouth-to-ass resuscitation.
-I'm on it!

57
00:05:16,142 --> 00:05:17,665
It's not working!

58
00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:22,173
I die happy knowing you fell for that.

59
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:26,649
His power supply is shut. He's flatlining!

60
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:32,229
Only one thing can keep him alive.

61
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:34,480
Possibly this thing.

62
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:44,068
Whoo! I've never felt so energetic.

63
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,317
That's because the doomsday device I showed
all up in you puts out 15 gigawatts.

64
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:54,070
That's ten times your recommended...
-Who are you, my warranty?

65
00:06:02,364 --> 00:06:06,572
For god sakes Bender, keep dancing!
Keep whooping it up!

66
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:12,200
You must burn off the doomsday energy
as fast as it's produced,

67
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,581
or it will build to critical levels!

68
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:18,107
You don't mean
-Oh but I do.

69
00:06:18,142 --> 00:06:23,545
If you stop partying for a single second,
you'll explode and kill everyone here

70
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:27,952
in a fireball melted gears 
and splattered bones!

71
00:06:29,611 --> 00:06:32,108
Sounds like a party, baby! Oh yeah!

72
00:06:33,844 --> 00:06:38,143
Hey speaking of splattered bowels,
can I cook you a romantic dinner tonight, Leela?

73
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:40,027
Where's Leela?

74
00:06:43,868 --> 00:06:47,329
Is she ok? Why hasn't she 
acknowledged my dinner offer?

75
00:06:47,364 --> 00:06:50,935
Something's wrong! She's not 
responding to my poking stick!

76
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:55,511
Poke harder, dammit!
-I'm poking as hard as I can!

77
00:06:55,934 --> 00:07:02,150
I'm sorry Fry, but I'm afraid Leela 
is in an irreversible coma.

78
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:23,566
My soulmate is gone. Why should I go on living?

79
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:25,705
Because the pain slowly fades,

80
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,849
but the love is forever.

81
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:32,385
But what if I forget the 
sweet sound of her voice,

82
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:35,151
or the moist touch 
of her eyeball on my lips?

83
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:39,440
Are you still hung-up on whatshername?
Move on already!

84
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:42,878
Maybe you're right.
-Maybe I'm always right.

85
00:07:55,624 --> 00:07:57,591
Build-a-bot workshop.

86
00:07:58,122 --> 00:07:59,860
It's time to start living again.

87
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:10,517
At least it's something to 
distract me from Leela.

88
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:15,686
Nah

89
00:08:17,946 --> 00:08:19,623
Now that I like for some reason.

90
00:08:25,436 --> 00:08:29,863
I like jelly beans. Do you?
-I sure do honey.

91
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:34,029
Come now Fry, you can't 
live out this sick fantasy.

92
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,367
Not without our help.

93
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:40,287
These security tapes record 
everything at Planet Express.

94
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:42,995
Including the ship, shower and urinals.

95
00:08:43,196 --> 00:08:46,530
At yet it still hasn't stop 
the illusive bathroom burglar.

96
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:49,526
Maybe he's just trying
 to feed his family

97
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:56,000
Computer, analyze tapes and and extract
 personality profile of one Turanga Leela.

98
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:59,981
Analyzing..Analyzing.. Checking my E-Bay bid..

99
00:09:00,323 --> 00:09:02,323
Dammit.
Analysis complete.

100
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:07,121
Hey, I was nuzling that.

101
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:11,401
Attributes transferred. Shoesize 12. Etc.

102
00:09:13,235 --> 00:09:17,309
Brace for an emergency landing!
What? We survived the crash?

103
00:09:17,554 --> 00:09:19,121
Oh Fry!

104
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,190
Party people in the house say...

105
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:27,781
This is wonderful. The last thing
I remember I was dying in an explosion.

106
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:31,181
Yet here I am in the flesh,
more alive than ever.

107
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,235
Alive?

108
00:09:33,816 --> 00:09:36,122
You better tell her, Fry.
-Tell me what?

109
00:09:36,395 --> 00:09:39,410
Anyway, my work is done.
I'm gonna hit the showers.

110
00:09:43,821 --> 00:09:46,537
Nibbler. Come give mama a hug.

111
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:50,471
What the.. Bad Nibbler, bad Nibbler!

112
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:55,384
What're you doing, pooperdoodle?
It's me, Leela!

113
00:10:13,342 --> 00:10:17,048
Am I really just a robot?
I mean, I have Leela's memories,

114
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:23,437
her opinion of gazelles - majestic.
her emotions - confused and hurt.

115
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:28,762
I swear, I didn't know this would happen.
The only thing I truly know is

116
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:30,521
I love you.

117
00:10:31,076 --> 00:10:33,281
I mean her.
Wait, help me out here.

118
00:10:45,914 --> 00:10:47,852
Do the Bender, do the Bender.

119
00:10:47,902 --> 00:10:50,364
No thank you.
-I said do it!

120
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:56,058
The truth is Fry, I still have feelings for you.
but are they really my feelings?

121
00:10:56,367 --> 00:11:02,052
Am I just an automaton, or can a machine have
sufficient complexity, legitimately achieve consciousness?

122
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:03,550
I agree

123
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:07,444
I need some time to figure this out.
Until then, friends?

124
00:11:08,378 --> 00:11:09,378
Okay.

125
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:15,699
Listen up disco-dummies!
You just flunked out of Bender's college of
party knowledge.

126
00:11:23,597 --> 00:11:26,960
Do the backdance, do the backdance.

127
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:31,446
Good news, everyone.

128
00:11:31,718 --> 00:11:35,516
I'm going to make one final attempt
to awaken Leela.

129
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,510
After all, there's always hope.

130
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:42,332
Really?
-No, don't get your hopes up.

131
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:45,855
Frankly, she's just a brainless mound of
scabs and puss.

132
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:48,951
I didn't need to hear that.

133
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,312
No and you don't need to see this.

134
00:11:53,664 --> 00:12:04,811
Wake up, wake up, wake up...

135
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:10,658
Well, that's it. I'm afraid 
traditional medicine has failed.

136
00:12:11,404 --> 00:12:13,252
No! I refuse to give up!

137
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:17,442
Wake up Leela! 
I... LOVE... YOU!

138
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,952
Fry stop.
She's gone.

139
00:12:20,398 --> 00:12:25,009
Dr. Zoidberg, can you note the time
and declare the patient legally dead?

140
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:28,031
Can I? That's my speciality!

141
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,276
As you all know, Leela's living will states
that in the event of coma,

142
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:51,870
her body is to be fed to the wild
cyclophage, a highly endangered creature
that eats only cyclopses.

143
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,349
Yup, that's what her donor-card says.

144
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:58,908
Goodbye my love.

145
00:13:05,861 --> 00:13:07,276
The beast approacheth.

146
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:21,036
Bender cut it out. People are 
trying to have emotions.

147
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:24,280
You think I wanna party?
I'm sick of partying.

148
00:13:24,818 --> 00:13:26,318
Wohoo! More partying!

149
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:36,972
Bender! Shut the hell up!

150
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:45,754
Bender! Stop shutting the hell up!

151
00:13:45,942 --> 00:13:50,366
Oh, right.
Leela's back, as if I care. Woo.

152
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:51,951
Alright, Leela!

153
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:56,729
Thanks. It's so nice to wake up and see..

154
00:14:00,713 --> 00:14:02,609
Leela!?
-Leela?

155
00:14:01,786 --> 00:14:04,384
Leela?
-Leela.

156
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:08,413
How is this possible? And can you believe
she wore a tanktop to my funeral?

157
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:10,670
Shut up! We got to get out of here!

158
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,391
No, YOU shut up we got to get out of here.

159
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:35,651
All aboard the party-ship!

160
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,630
There's no room for two 
captain's butt's in this chair.

161
00:14:43,765 --> 00:14:48,122
-There would be if you'd taken a spin class
instead of just lounging around in a coma!

162
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:04,733
This is crazy. It's like I'm looking
at an exact robot duplicate of myself.

163
00:15:04,768 --> 00:15:06,633
That is what you're looking at.

164
00:15:06,668 --> 00:15:09,552
Oh. How could you do this Fry?

165
00:15:09,587 --> 00:15:11,796
Uh.. Coma.. Sad..

166
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:14,472
I have to go. This is just too freaky.

167
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:18,307
Please don't get upset, Leela.
She's nothing like you.

168
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:21,108
I have to go. This is just too freaky.

169
00:15:27,484 --> 00:15:29,119
I need chearing up Bender.

170
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:32,221
I don't know, you want to 
go out and party tonight?

171
00:15:32,713 --> 00:15:36,963
I hate partying! If only I didn't have
so much cronk in my donkydonk.

172
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:41,142
Why does everything I date run away?

173
00:15:41,678 --> 00:15:46,950
I love Leela, always and forever,
and if I loved robot-Leela too,

174
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:50,886
that's only because she had
so much of the real Leela in her

175
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,942
I thought she loved me too,
but obviously I was wrong as usual.

176
00:15:56,425 --> 00:15:57,455
Wrong again.

177
00:15:57,717 --> 00:15:58,651
You were right.

178
00:15:58,686 --> 00:16:02,333
Leela? Leela-Leela?
Leela-Leela.

179
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:07,250
I've been thinking Fry. If I lost you,
I don't think I could stand it either.

180
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:09,724
I'd propably build 
a copy of you too.

181
00:16:11,145 --> 00:16:14,510
As long as robo-Leela's not
a jealous type like me, things will

182
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:16,812
I'LL KILL YOU YOU SLUTCLOPS!

183
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:20,914
He's mine!
Back off, missy!

184
00:16:28,143 --> 00:16:29,577
Somebody do something!

185
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:31,172
Here, take this!

186
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,992
A gun? Do I really need to..

187
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:37,677
-Shoot her! She's the robot!
-No! Shoot her! She's the human!

188
00:16:37,878 --> 00:16:40,956
But how do I know who's the human
and who's the robot?

189
00:16:41,112 --> 00:16:43,307
We just told you!
-Yea you idiot!

190
00:16:43,373 --> 00:16:48,031
Ok. Fine. If you're gonna be like that,
I'm not shooting anyone.

191
00:16:50,236 --> 00:16:53,066
Right between the lungs.
Man that was close.

192
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:01,768
I'm a robot too!

193
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:05,521
Aha! That explains this growth on your driveshaft!

194
00:17:05,556 --> 00:17:08,130
But how is this possible?
-Who knows.

195
00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:14,186
Oh, I do. Allow me to explain what really
happened the day the ship crashed.

196
00:17:21,762 --> 00:17:26,721
I'll protect you Leela. My love is stronger than
the vast majority of explosions.

197
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:33,849
Fry did infact save Leela, though
at a terrible cost to himself.

198
00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:40,453
I tossed him into the stem cells, but
he just bubbled away like flem on a hot sidewalk.

199
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:45,899
Leela was so distraught, she went all 
Blade Runner and built a duplicate.

200
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:51,436
Then uploaded Fry's personality from the
urinal surveillance tapes.

201
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:53,078
I sure love Leela.

202
00:17:55,505 --> 00:18:02,466
Alas, in recreating Fry's adorable jelly-belly
she had overstuffed him with copperwadding.

203
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:11,000
The innevitable static discharge electrocuted Leela
And destroyed both of their short-term memories.

204
00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:14,685
So that's why I'm so amazed 
by these things I already knew.

205
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:18,071
What could I do? I hung up Leela
with the other bonebags

206
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:22,091
and went to procure the final ingredient
for my stem cell brew.

207
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:29,283
Professor, my Fry-fro's all frizzy.

208
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:33,853
My god, I can't believe I'll never see
that particular Fry again.

209
00:18:38,357 --> 00:18:39,602
Hey where's my shoes?

210
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:41,829
Fry?

211
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,512
Oh I'm sorry. I didn't realise
 I was already here.

212
00:18:45,065 --> 00:18:48,474
Wait, what's with all the Leelas?
-Trust me, don't ask.

213
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:52,551
Ok dork. Listen, I'm gonna hit the urinal,
maybe talk about myself a little bit..

214
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:55,415
Hang on. It's time to sort things out.

215
00:18:55,729 --> 00:19:01,895
The truth is, I love Fry. That Fry.
-And I love Leela. Any Leela.

216
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,627
We're robots and we're in love.
Let's ditch these meatjackets.

217
00:19:09,012 --> 00:19:13,852
Whoa, cool!
Hasta la vista, weener.

218
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:17,323
We'll be back. For our stuff.

219
00:19:20,685 --> 00:19:22,380
Why did their voices change?

220
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:26,104
That's the one thing 
we'll never truly understand.

221
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:31,671
Uh, this is a bit awkward. Or is it?
-I'm not sure.

222
00:19:31,706 --> 00:19:34,217
I lost track around the second robot.

223
00:19:34,252 --> 00:19:38,373
Well, you know how I feel.
I waited for you for a thousand years,

224
00:19:38,374 --> 00:19:40,189
I can wait a little longer.

225
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:43,662
What a load a mush! I've had it.

226
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:51,457
He's gonna blow!
-Party, Bender. Party for your life!

227
00:19:51,545 --> 00:19:53,092
No chance high-pants!

228
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:57,929
 I'd rather die and kill all of you 
than party for one more millisecond!

229
00:20:00,836 --> 00:20:02,349
The cyclops-eater!

230
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:19,652
Hold on, man! It ain't like that!

231
00:20:31,703 --> 00:20:33,805
Jeesh, what does it take to kill me?

232
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:42,000
Bender, you blew out your excess capacity!
You're cured!

233
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:48,916
Sweet mercy! My hellish nightmare is over!
I never have to party again.

234
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:50,499
Well, that's that then.

235
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,558
We're back everyone!
-PARTAYH!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
