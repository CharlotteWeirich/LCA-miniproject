00:00:27,936 --> 00:00:29,701
<i>The equalists are on the attack.</i>

8
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:33,065
<i>The Lieutenant and his chi-blockers
invaded air temple island</i>

00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,105

One Book: Air, Episode 11
"Skeletons in the Closet"

16
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:57,102
It is a glorious day my equalist
brothers and sisters.

17
00:00:57,742 --> 00:01:01,851
Amon has torn down the tyrannical
bending government!

18
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,362
He has declared
bending, illegal!.

19
00:01:06,225 --> 00:01:09,634
And he has the Avatar
on the run.

20
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:13,752
Our great leader has a
vision for the future.

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,523
One day soon bending
will no longer exist

22
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:21,128
and we will live in a world where
everyone is finally equal!

23
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:25,509
The united forces are on their way
right now to try and stop that dream

24
00:01:25,672 --> 00:01:28,679
but we will prevail!

25
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,879
Can you believe Hiroshi?
"The Avatar's on the run".

26
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,150
I'm not running from anyone.

27
00:01:48,088 --> 00:01:49,925
Let's go back up there
and knock some heads.

28
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:50,802
They'll never know
what hit them.

29
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,829
Relax.

30
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:55,084
General Iroh's coming with an
entire fleet of battleships.

31
00:01:55,463 --> 00:01:57,111
Then Amon will be the
one who's running.

32
00:01:57,588 --> 00:01:59,825
I hate this "being patient"
stuff.

33
00:02:06,423 --> 00:02:07,585
You two were gone a while.

34
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,089
We were doing reconnaissance.

35
00:02:10,557 --> 00:02:11,345
Whatever.

36
00:02:11,983 --> 00:02:12,955
Welcome back!

37
00:02:13,273 --> 00:02:16,807
Hope you worked up an appetite
because dinner is served.

38
00:02:18,782 --> 00:02:21,684
Thanks so much for letting us hide
out with you the past few days.

39
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,080
Honored to oblige.

40
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:28,172
My associates and I heartily
oppose Amon's so-called
"equalist" policies.

41
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:31,575
We got benders and non-benders
living together down here

44
00:02:37,622 --> 00:02:39,579
You are a wise
and noble hobo.

45
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:45,142
This is the best-tasting street
gruel I've ever had.

46
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:46,127
Seriously.

47
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:50,155
I culled it from the finest dumpsters
the city has to offer.

48
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,346
Can't sleep either?

49
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:11,187
No, I have this awful
pit in my stomach.

50
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:12,198
Me too.

51
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:16,056
It's so crazy.
A few months ago,

52
00:03:16,057 --> 00:03:18,973
I was in the South pole practicing
for my firebending test

53
00:03:19,654 --> 00:03:21,701
and now I'm in the middle
of an all-out war.

54
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:23,116
I know.

55
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:25,069
We didn't even
know each other then.

56
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,626
And now, I can't imagine
my life without you in it.

57
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:33,442
You're the most loyal brave, and
selfless person I've ever known.

58
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,616
I think you're pretty
incredible too but

59
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,620
you already knew that.

60
00:03:43,077 --> 00:03:44,863
I should probably
try to get some sleep.

61
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:46,404
Me too.

62
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,592
Good night.

63
00:03:49,918 --> 00:03:50,437
Good night.

64
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:10,303
You will now be cleansed
of your impurity.

65
00:04:18,784 --> 00:04:19,660
Next.

66
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:34,145
Coast is clear.

67
00:04:49,813 --> 00:04:53,319
Once the united forces arrive we
need to be ready to help
in any way we can.

68
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:54,141
They're here.

69
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:09,116
Amon had to know
we were coming.

70
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,328
So why aren't we meeting
any resistance?

71
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:13,528
Wait a second.

72
00:05:13,976 --> 00:05:15,587
Where are the equalist
airships?

73
00:05:20,777 --> 00:05:22,654
I don't see any mecha-tanks
either.

74
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:36,959
Something's not right.

75
00:05:43,412 --> 00:05:44,096
It's a trick!

76
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,898
Water and earthbenders
detonate those mines!

77
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,227
What is that sound?

78
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,275
What now?

79
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:28,950
Where does Hiroshi find the
time to keep inventing
new evil machines?

80
00:07:17,981 --> 00:07:19,140
Incoming!

81
00:09:09,184 --> 00:09:10,774
It's all right.
I've got you.

82
00:09:12,658 --> 00:09:13,685
Avatar Korra...

83
00:09:15,736 --> 00:09:16,890
You saved my life.

84
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:18,274
Thank you.

85
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:29,601
I was prepared to deal with
sato's mecha-tanks

86
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:31,912
but not these new
high-speed aircraft.

87
00:09:31,913 --> 00:09:32,293
I know.

88
00:09:32,683 --> 00:09:36,062
Every time we think we have an
advantage Amon outsmarts us.

89
00:09:36,182 --> 00:09:38,717
No matter what our plan is
he always has a better one.

90
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:43,583
Amon is winning so far but we're
not out of the fight yet.

91
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:45,909
I like this man's confidence.

92
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:48,653
So, How are we not
out of the fight?

93
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:51,638
A second wave of reinforcements
is on the way.

94
00:09:52,044 --> 00:09:53,077
But I need to warn them.

95
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:55,062
Do you still have a way
to get a message out?

96
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:56,579
I know just the
man for the job.

97
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:01,636
And who is the recipient
of this top-secret message?

98
00:10:01,714 --> 00:10:02,526
Commander Bumi.

99
00:10:02,945 --> 00:10:04,661
Second division of
the united forces.

100
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,861
Tenzin's brother?

101
00:10:05,924 --> 00:10:08,052
Yes.
A bit of a wild man

102
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,967
but the bravest Commander
you'll ever meet.

103
00:10:10,186 --> 00:10:10,854
Ready, sir!

104
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:13,973
Fleet ambushed and destroyed
by equalist aircraft.

105
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:16,845
Retreat to red sand island
until my signal.

106
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:20,434
Do not approach city until
you receive the all-clear.

107
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:25,141
Now comes the hard part.

108
00:10:25,671 --> 00:10:27,292
We need to ground those aircraft,

109
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,750
otherwise Bumi's fleet will never
be able to retake the city.

110
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:32,393
They flew in from
this direction.

111
00:10:32,868 --> 00:10:35,210
The airfield must be somewhere
over this Mountain range.

112
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:36,881
Everyone get ready.

113
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,531
We leave at dawn.

114
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:44,202
It's time to take
down my father.

115
00:10:50,614 --> 00:10:51,132
Wait.

116
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:53,654
I'm sorry, but

117
00:10:53,998 --> 00:10:55,393
I'm not going with
you tomorrow.

118
00:10:55,707 --> 00:10:56,223
What?

119
00:10:56,509 --> 00:10:57,039
Why not?

120
00:10:57,427 --> 00:10:59,283
I'm sick and tired of
hiding from Amon.

121
00:10:59,644 --> 00:11:00,734
It's time I face him.

122
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,327
That's not a good plan.

123
00:11:02,673 --> 00:11:03,939
We need to stick together.

124
00:11:04,182 --> 00:11:06,056
I'm not waiting for him
to hunt me down.

125
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:08,945
My gut's telling me
it's time to end this.

126
00:11:09,338 --> 00:11:10,532
On my terms.

127
00:11:11,034 --> 00:11:14,037
Korra, this is not a mission you
should be handling alone.

128
00:11:14,277 --> 00:11:15,076
She won't be.

129
00:11:15,506 --> 00:11:16,464
I'm going with you.

130
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:19,479
You don't have
to do that.

131
00:11:19,676 --> 00:11:21,711
Yes, I do.

132
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:29,044
My grandfather would respect
the Avatar's instinct.

133
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:30,832
So will I.

134
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:39,012
Love you, little bro.

135
00:11:39,203 --> 00:11:40,642
Love you back, big bro.

136
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:48,459
Korra, Amon is a nasty dude.

137
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:49,847
Be careful.

138
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:50,557
I will.

139
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:52,350
Good luck.

140
00:11:53,753 --> 00:11:55,050
If you're going into the mountains,

141
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:56,495
you should bring naga.

142
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,881
Take good care
of bolin for me.

143
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,804
Asami.

144
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:06,589
I'm sorry things got
so messed up between us

145
00:12:06,952 --> 00:12:08,480
but whatever happens today.

146
00:12:08,814 --> 00:12:10,959
I want you to know how
much I care about you.

147
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:12,785
I care about you too.

148
00:12:29,976 --> 00:12:34,347
Good fortune and success
to you, Valiant heroes!

149
00:12:58,025 --> 00:12:58,782
There's Amon!

150
00:13:01,144 --> 00:13:02,496
We need to get into the temple.

151
00:13:03,113 --> 00:13:04,543
Then, when he returns...

152
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:05,884
We ambush him.

153
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:12,593
What are you two
doing here?

154
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,485
Uh..., We were
just transferred.

155
00:13:16,643 --> 00:13:18,733
Well, you're getting
transferred again.

156
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:21,835
Amon wants extra security
at the arena today.

157
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:23,937
The arena?,
For what?

158
00:13:24,105 --> 00:13:24,861
The rally.

159
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,055
You should have been
briefed about this.

160
00:13:27,643 --> 00:13:28,580
We'll be there, sir!

161
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:31,626
I know another way in.

162
00:13:43,527 --> 00:13:44,573
Let's hide in the attic.

163
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:49,937
Uh...!,

164
00:13:50,514 --> 00:13:51,677
we're not alone up here.

165
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:54,873
Tarrlok?

166
00:13:57,372 --> 00:13:59,635
I don't suppose
you're here to rescue me?

167
00:14:00,176 --> 00:14:02,352
We had no idea
you were here.

168
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:04,441
Are there other prisoners
on the island?

169
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:05,251
No,

170
00:14:05,918 --> 00:14:07,069
I'm the only one.

171
00:14:07,576 --> 00:14:09,257
And what makes you so special?

172
00:14:10,554 --> 00:14:12,247
I'm Amon's brother.

173
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,129
Amon is from the northern
water tribe.

174
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,732
He is a waterbender
and a bloodbender,

175
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:27,105
just like I was.

176
00:14:27,374 --> 00:14:27,946
What?!

177
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:30,238
Did you know this all along?

178
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:33,614
No, not until after he captured me.

179
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:36,715
How did your brother end
up becoming Amon?

180
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,891
It all began with my father,

181
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:39,881
Yakone...

182
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:44,416
With the help of his former gang,
he escaped prison

183
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:47,109
and underwent surgery
to change his appearance.

184
00:14:48,613 --> 00:14:50,090
He assumed a new identity

185
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,444
and settled down in the
northern water tribe.

186
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:55,768
That's where he met my mother,

187
00:14:56,524 --> 00:14:58,084
a warm caring woman.

188
00:15:02,183 --> 00:15:04,876
Before long, they started
a family together.

189
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:09,238
Amon was the firstborn
under the name Noatak.

190
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:11,217
I was born three years later.

191
00:15:12,624 --> 00:15:14,535
Noatak was a good-natured kid,

192
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:16,291
always looking out for me.

193
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:18,784
Those were the good years,

194
00:15:19,343 --> 00:15:22,296
before my brother and I discovered
we were waterbenders.

195
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:25,525
At first, we were excited
by our new abilities

196
00:15:26,178 --> 00:15:28,946
but our training brought out
a different side of my father.

197
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:30,109
Tarrlok!

198
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:35,223
You better shape up or you'll be out here
in the cold all night until you get it right.

199
00:15:35,224 --> 00:15:36,583
I'm trying, but...

200
00:15:36,584 --> 00:15:37,292
Try harder!

201
00:15:37,822 --> 00:15:39,842
Your brother was never this sloppy.

202
00:15:40,286 --> 00:15:41,606
Dad, he'll get it.

203
00:15:42,136 --> 00:15:43,301
He just needs time.

204
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:46,420
Don't talk back to me, son.
Ever!

205
00:15:46,718 --> 00:15:47,809
Even back then,

206
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,004
my brother wanted everyone
to be treated fairly and equally.

207
00:15:52,502 --> 00:15:53,513
When I was seven,

208
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:56,298
my father took me and Noatak
on a hunting trip,

209
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:58,428
far away from our home.

210
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:02,096
He told us his true identity
was Yakone,

211
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:05,502
Republic city's most
notorious crime boss

212
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:09,647
and that he was once a
bloodbender of rare skill.

213
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:11,995
What's bloodbending?

214
00:16:12,282 --> 00:16:16,521
The most powerful and feared
form of bending in the world.

215
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,660
It was declared illegal
thanks to that coward, katara.

216
00:16:21,251 --> 00:16:24,923
Our family has the strongest
line of bloodbenders in history.

217
00:16:25,514 --> 00:16:28,084
You boys have this power
inside of you

218
00:16:28,084 --> 00:16:30,293
and I will teach you
to master it.

219
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:32,762
What happened
to your bending, dad?

220
00:16:33,762 --> 00:16:36,141
The Avatar stole it from me.

221
00:16:36,925 --> 00:16:39,138
That's why I brought
you out here,

222
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:40,761
to learn your destiny.

223
00:16:41,077 --> 00:16:43,946
You two will become bloodbenders
of the highest order.

224
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:47,868
When the time is right you
will claim Republic city

225
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:50,205
and you will
destroy the Avatar.

226
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:52,327
You must avenge me.

227
00:16:52,838 --> 00:16:55,669
That is your purpose in life.

228
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,541
The good days
were behind us.

229
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,393
Every full moon,

230
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,444
our father took us on another
supposed "hunting" trip.

231
00:17:05,754 --> 00:17:08,437
where he secretly trained
us in bloodbending.

232
00:17:09,206 --> 00:17:11,114
We kept the truth
from our mother.

233
00:17:19,742 --> 00:17:21,995
Stop! You're hurting it!

234
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:23,497
Toughen up!,
Tarrlok.

235
00:17:23,946 --> 00:17:25,727
You'll need a thicker
skin for this.

236
00:17:32,156 --> 00:17:33,518
Very good, son.

237
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:35,255
Very good.

238
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:39,845
A few years later,

239
00:17:39,846 --> 00:17:41,978
my father taught us to
bloodbend anytime,

240
00:17:42,288 --> 00:17:44,005
without the need
of the full moon.

241
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,554
We practiced constantly

242
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,397
and I hated every minute of it.

243
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:06,264
I had no stomach for
manipulating helpless animals.

244
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:08,535
My brother however,

245
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:11,045
seemed to revel in his
new found power.

246
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:16,904
He was a prodigy,

247
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:21,845
mastering my father's psychic
bloodbending technique by
the time he was 14.

248
00:18:40,221 --> 00:18:41,929
That's the way it's done.

249
00:18:42,098 --> 00:18:44,197
That's what you need
to strive for.

250
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:50,616
Even though Noatak was my
father's favorite it wasn't
any easier for him.

251
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:55,258
He carried the burden of all Yakone's
expectations and demands.

252
00:18:58,901 --> 00:19:01,676
Something changed in
Noatak over the years.

253
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,584
The loving brother I once
knew became cold

254
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,992
and detached.

255
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:12,001
Our father pushed us
to extremes

256
00:19:12,214 --> 00:19:16,233
and one day he made us
bloodbend each other.

257
00:19:17,643 --> 00:19:18,523
Noatak,

258
00:19:19,078 --> 00:19:19,548
Go.

259
00:19:35,312 --> 00:19:36,210
Excellent.

260
00:19:43,212 --> 00:19:43,792
Tarrlok!

261
00:19:44,613 --> 00:19:45,414
Your turn.

262
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,122
No,

263
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,141
I won't do it.

264
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:50,648
Bloodbend your
brother Tarrlok!

265
00:19:50,745 --> 00:19:51,965
That felt awful!

266
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:53,762
I don't want to
do that to anyone!

267
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:55,912
I never want to
bloodbend again!

268
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:58,013
You're a disgrace,

269
00:19:58,475 --> 00:19:59,437
a weakling.

270
00:20:00,689 --> 00:20:02,944
I'll teach you a lesson
you insubordinate,

271
00:20:05,242 --> 00:20:07,137
Stay away from him.

272
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,949
How dare you bloodbend me?

273
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:12,608
What are you going
to do about it?

274
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,019
You're the weak one.

275
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:20,672
You always say bloodbending
is the most powerful thing
in the world,

276
00:20:21,237 --> 00:20:22,110
but it isn't,

277
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:24,097
The Avatar is.

278
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:26,223
He took your bending away.

279
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,778
What could be more
powerful than that?

280
00:20:29,022 --> 00:20:32,271
I made you,
What you are!

281
00:20:32,673 --> 00:20:34,366
You're mine!

282
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:36,188
We're your sons,

283
00:20:36,648 --> 00:20:38,254
Not your tools of revenge!

284
00:20:39,077 --> 00:20:39,622
Let's go.

285
00:20:40,303 --> 00:20:42,513
We can run away
from him, forever.

286
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,586
Run away?

287
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:44,984
But, What about mom?

288
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:46,639
We can't just leave her.

289
00:20:47,141 --> 00:20:48,378
He was right about you.

290
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:50,400
You are a weakling.

291
00:20:58,072 --> 00:20:59,005
Noatak!

292
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:00,792
Don't leave, please!

293
00:21:01,618 --> 00:21:02,714
Noatak!

294
00:21:08,674 --> 00:21:10,574
My father and I searched
for days,

295
00:21:10,715 --> 00:21:12,837
but we never found
a sign of Noatak.

296
00:21:13,611 --> 00:21:15,577
We thought he perished
in that storm.

297
00:21:16,313 --> 00:21:17,847
My mother was never the same,

298
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:19,532
after the loss of my brother.

299
00:21:23,071 --> 00:21:24,653
My father stopped training me.

300
00:21:25,313 --> 00:21:28,060
With Noatak gone his hopes
for revenge withered

301
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,286
and he passed away a few years later.

302
00:21:39,171 --> 00:21:41,715
That's one of the saddest
stories I've ever heard.

303
00:21:42,378 --> 00:21:43,425
Avatar Korra,

304
00:21:43,783 --> 00:21:46,188
I am truly sorry for all
that, I did to you.

305
00:21:46,887 --> 00:21:48,711
I thought, I was better
than my father,

306
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,203
but his ghost still
shaped me.

307
00:21:51,648 --> 00:21:55,278
I became a soldier of revenge
just like he wanted me to be

308
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,755
and so did my brother.

309
00:21:58,746 --> 00:22:00,015
The revolution,

310
00:22:00,247 --> 00:22:01,786
may be built on a lie,

311
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:07,599
but I think Amon truly believes
bending is the source of
all evil in the world.

312
00:22:08,017 --> 00:22:10,163
How did you figure out
Amon is your brother?

313
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:11,959
When he took my bending,

314
00:22:12,406 --> 00:22:14,529
the sensation
was somehow familiar.

315
00:22:15,288 --> 00:22:18,322
I later recognized it as
my brother's bloodbending grip.

316
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:23,519
So, He somehow uses bloodbending
to take people's bending?

317
00:22:23,704 --> 00:22:25,458
I don't know how
he does it,

318
00:22:25,904 --> 00:22:29,322
but then again, I've never encountered
a bender as strong as Noatak.

319
00:22:29,503 --> 00:22:31,198
How in the world
do we beat him?

320
00:22:31,544 --> 00:22:32,451
We can't.

321
00:22:33,053 --> 00:22:35,744
Any attack we throw at him
he'll redirect with his mind.

322
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:38,347
That's how he's been able
to challenge any bender.

323
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:39,854
So much for our ambush.

324
00:22:40,174 --> 00:22:41,684
If we stay here,
we're toast.

325
00:22:42,886 --> 00:22:44,253
But there's another way
to beat him.

326
00:22:44,332 --> 00:22:44,952
How?

327
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:46,567
This whole time,

328
00:22:46,743 --> 00:22:48,652
Amon has been
one step ahead of us.

329
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:51,177
But finally we have
the advantage,

330
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,877
we know the truth about him.

331
00:22:53,148 --> 00:22:56,401
If we expose him as a bender
in front of all his supporters,

332
00:22:56,612 --> 00:22:57,663
At the rally.

333
00:22:57,733 --> 00:22:59,549
We could take away
his true power.

334
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:01,351
And undermine
this whole revolution!

335
00:23:03,242 --> 00:23:04,618
Thank you, for your help.

336
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,369
We can't just leave him here.

337
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:11,049
Go.

338
00:23:11,546 --> 00:23:13,737
Amon can't know anyone
spoke with me.

339
00:23:14,368 --> 00:23:15,527
Defeat him.

340
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,163
Put an end
to this sad story.
