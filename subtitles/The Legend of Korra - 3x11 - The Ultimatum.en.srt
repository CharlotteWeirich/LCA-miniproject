1
00:00:06,476 --> 00:00:08,475
Earth.

2
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:10,475
Fire.

3
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:11,476
Air.

4
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:14,475
Water.

5
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:20,557
Only the Avatar can master all four
elements and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:28,175
Ba Sing Se has fallen!

8
00:00:28,176 --> 00:00:30,175
After Zaheer and the Red
Lotus toppled the Earth Queen,

9
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:32,175
the city descended into chaos.

10
00:00:32,176 --> 00:00:36,176
Meanwhile, Korra and Asami tried to escape
their captors but crashed in the desert.

11
00:00:36,177 --> 00:00:39,176
After getting to safety, they met up
with Lord Zuko, Tonraq, and Beifong.

12
00:00:39,177 --> 00:00:42,175
Back in Ba Sing Se, Zaheer
freed Mako and Bolin,

13
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:45,175
giving them a vital
message to deliver to Korra.

14
00:00:45,176 --> 00:00:46,339
But will the brothers find her in time?

15
00:00:46,888 --> 00:00:50,010
_

16
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:02,175
I can't believe it. The
upper ring is in chaos.

17
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:05,175
Don't try to stop us. We're
taking back what's ours.

18
00:01:05,176 --> 00:01:07,175
Stop you? I'm gonna join you.

19
00:01:07,176 --> 00:01:08,850
I know where the good stuff is.

20
00:01:10,176 --> 00:01:13,175
- Should we do something?
- This isn't our battle.

21
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:16,175
We have to deliver Zaheer's
message to Korra immediately.

22
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:19,175
Right. Okay.
Find Korra, deliver message.

23
00:01:19,176 --> 00:01:20,166
Yeah, this should be easy.

24
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:23,175
We just gotta get out of the city and
get to the desert, then somehow find her

25
00:01:23,176 --> 00:01:28,175
in the vast, expansive wasteland that goes
on for thousands and thousands of miles.

26
00:01:28,176 --> 00:01:31,175
This isn't gonna be easy.

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,636
We need an airship.

28
00:01:40,177 --> 00:01:43,175
Excuse me, may I have
your attention please?

29
00:01:43,176 --> 00:01:45,175
I'm with the Republic City police,

30
00:01:45,176 --> 00:01:49,135
and I need to commandeer this
airship to help the Avatar.

31
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:55,175
Let me give it a shot.

32
00:01:55,176 --> 00:01:57,175
Hey, the Queen's gold is on
the third floor of the palace!

33
00:01:57,176 --> 00:02:01,175
Second door on the right!

34
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:05,175
You just gotta know how
to talk to them, bro.

35
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:07,175
They took everything.

36
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:09,175
I mean, who rips out a transmission radio?

37
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:13,175
Some folks just do not have
respect for other people's property.

38
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:15,175
Now let's steal this airship!

39
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,175
You know how to fly this thing?

40
00:02:17,176 --> 00:02:19,175
Technically speaking? No.

41
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:23,175
But, come on, how hard can it be?

42
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,175
Up! Up!

43
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:29,175
I don't see any "up" button.
I see levers and switches.

44
00:02:29,176 --> 00:02:31,176
Oh, there it is.

45
00:02:38,176 --> 00:02:41,175
The whole city is falling to pieces.

46
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:43,175
Mako, our family's down there.

47
00:02:43,176 --> 00:02:44,176
- Move over.
- Ahh!

48
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:46,175
We're getting them out.

49
00:02:46,176 --> 00:02:50,175
Oh, you think just because you dated Asami,
you know how to fly this better than me?

50
00:02:50,176 --> 00:02:52,176
Yeah.

51
00:03:01,176 --> 00:03:03,175
Bolin? What are you doing here?

52
00:03:03,176 --> 00:03:05,175
I came to get you guys out.

53
00:03:05,176 --> 00:03:07,175
This whole block is
about to go up in flames.

54
00:03:07,176 --> 00:03:09,175
Come on, Mako and I have
an airship on the roof.

55
00:03:09,176 --> 00:03:12,175
We can't. Grandma won't go.

56
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:17,175
This place is my whole
world. I will not leave.

57
00:03:17,176 --> 00:03:21,175
Oh, but I'm so glad my little
Bolin has come back to visit.

58
00:03:21,176 --> 00:03:24,175
Sit down. Would you like some tea?

59
00:03:24,176 --> 00:03:25,176
Grandma, we don't have time for tea.

60
00:03:25,177 --> 00:03:28,175
- Mom, please.
- No!

61
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:31,175
I can't abandon the place
where I raised my family.

62
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:33,175
It's my home.

63
00:03:33,176 --> 00:03:35,826
Grandma, there's one thing
that Mako and I have learned

64
00:03:35,827 --> 00:03:37,493
from all our years on the street:

65
00:03:37,528 --> 00:03:39,175
It doesn't matter where you go.

66
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:45,175
If you have your family with
you, you'll always be at home.

67
00:03:45,176 --> 00:03:47,175
I'm not going.

68
00:03:47,176 --> 00:03:49,175
Fine! You leave me no choice.

69
00:03:49,176 --> 00:03:51,175
We're rolling out!

70
00:03:51,176 --> 00:03:53,175
Wait.

71
00:03:53,176 --> 00:03:56,176
Okay, let's go.

72
00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:14,175
Thanks for getting us out of there.

73
00:04:14,176 --> 00:04:16,175
I mean, I probably could
have handled it myself

74
00:04:16,176 --> 00:04:21,176
if you guys didn't show up, but thanks.

75
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:27,175
May she rest in peace.

76
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:30,175
This airship is nice. Is it our new home?

77
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:33,175
No, grandma, I'm not sure
where we're gonna take you.

78
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:35,175
But right now, we need to find Korra.

79
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:36,176
Did something happen to the Avatar?

80
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:38,175
I'm afraid so.

81
00:04:38,176 --> 00:04:40,571
Her airship went down
somewhere in the desert.

82
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,800
She was coming from a military
base near the Misty Palms Oasis

83
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:45,529
and heading to Ba Sing Se.

84
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,417
If we retrace her route back to the
base, we should find the wreckage.

85
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:17,175
Guys, it's the wreckage. I found it.

86
00:05:17,176 --> 00:05:19,175
There.

87
00:05:19,176 --> 00:05:21,175
That's a Ba Sing Se airship, all right.

88
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:23,175
But where's the rest of it?

89
00:05:23,176 --> 00:05:26,176
I don't know, but there are some tracks.

90
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:41,176
See? I told you. Landing is hard.

91
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:51,175
Spirits.

92
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:54,175
Okay, guys, we think Korra
found her way back here.

93
00:05:54,176 --> 00:05:56,175
Now let's split off into
teams and scour the town.

94
00:05:56,176 --> 00:05:58,175
Yes, we'll need your help too, Pabu.

95
00:05:58,176 --> 00:06:00,175
Now just give me a second while I

96
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:03,175
Wait. Pabu?

97
00:06:03,176 --> 00:06:06,175
Pabu!

98
00:06:06,176 --> 00:06:10,175
Why is Bolin hugging that big rat?

99
00:06:10,176 --> 00:06:13,175
Ew. Now he's kissing it.

100
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:15,175
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

101
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:17,175
I'm never gonna let you go again.

102
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,175
Guys, look out! Giant dogbeast thingy!

103
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:25,175
Okay, all right, Naga.
It's good to see you too.

104
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:28,175
Ahh, stop. You're licking my mouth.

105
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:32,175
Asami! Korra!

106
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:34,176
You guys are okay!

107
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:40,175
Sorry, I was just it's so good to see you.

108
00:06:40,176 --> 00:06:43,175
It's really good to see
you too, both of you.

109
00:06:43,176 --> 00:06:45,175
Good. You guys aren't dead.

110
00:06:45,176 --> 00:06:48,175
Don't get all mushy on me, Chief.

111
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:51,175
Tonraq, Sir.

112
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:54,175
Oh, my gosh. It's Lord Zuko.

113
00:06:54,176 --> 00:06:58,175
I can't believe it.

114
00:06:58,176 --> 00:07:00,175
Uh, forgive my brother.

115
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:03,175
We're just really honored to meet you, Sir.

116
00:07:03,176 --> 00:07:07,010
It's a pleasure to meet you as well.

117
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:09,175
You must be the Avatar.

118
00:07:09,176 --> 00:07:12,175
Mako told me so much about you.

119
00:07:12,176 --> 00:07:15,175
You are even more
beautiful than I imagined.

120
00:07:15,176 --> 00:07:19,175
Uh, actually, that's
Asami. This is Avatar Korra.

121
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:22,175
Korra, this is my grandma, Yin.

122
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:26,175
You are very muscular for a woman.

123
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:29,175
Um, thanks. You too?

124
00:07:29,176 --> 00:07:31,175
What lovely young women.

125
00:07:31,176 --> 00:07:36,175
Mako, why aren't you dating
any nice girls like them?

126
00:07:36,176 --> 00:07:39,175
Uh, so what happened to you two?

127
00:07:39,176 --> 00:07:41,175
Where have you been?

128
00:07:41,176 --> 00:07:44,175
We were captured by Zaheer
and taken to Ba Sing Se.

129
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:46,175
We were there when the
Earth Queen was overthrown.

130
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:48,175
What? How did you escape?

131
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,176
Zaheer let us go.

132
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,175
Why would he do that?

133
00:07:51,176 --> 00:07:54,175
Because he wanted us to find
you and deliver a message.

134
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:57,175
Zaheer is headed to the
northern air temple as we speak.

135
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,175
He said he's gonna wipe
out the new air nation

136
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:02,176
and everyone in it, unless
you turn yourself over to him.

137
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:12,165
Zaheer's threatening innocent
lives, just to get to me.

138
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,658
He could be bluffing.

139
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,553
He's already taken out the Earth Queen.

140
00:08:15,554 --> 00:08:17,179
I don't think he bluffs.

141
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,457
We need to radio Tenzin and warn
him that the Red Lotus is coming.

142
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,073
I agree. Unfortunately, we don't
have a radio on the airship.

143
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:25,921
There's a portable radio in the jeep,

144
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,802
but the signal will never make
it to the northern air temple.

145
00:08:28,803 --> 00:08:32,102
We need to get to a place that
has a strong radio transmitter.

146
00:08:32,103 --> 00:08:33,812
The metal clan will have one.

147
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:36,317
Let's go. We'll radio Su on the way.

148
00:08:36,352 --> 00:08:38,946
Hopefully she can get ahold
of Tenzin at the air temple

149
00:08:38,947 --> 00:08:40,754
by the time we get to Zaofu.

150
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:51,130
Did you have any luck
getting through to Tenzin?

151
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:54,140
No one's answering. What if
Zaheer is already up there?

152
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:59,007
- I should never have let Opal go.
- It's going to be okay, Su.

153
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:01,007
I hope so.

154
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:09,207
We have a strong signal,
but no one's answering.

155
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:13,376
I can't just sit around here while a madman
is on his way to the northern air temple.

156
00:09:13,377 --> 00:09:16,013
- We have to do something.
- I'll ready my airship.

157
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:19,764
With the full force of the metal clan
security backing us, we can take them.

158
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:23,869
We'll never make it up there before Zaheer.

159
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,724
There might be another way to stop him.

160
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:29,207
It's a long shot, but Zaheer is always
meditating into the Spirit World,

161
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:32,207
and I know exactly where
Xai Bau's grove.

162
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:35,207
If I could find him there,
maybe I could somehow trap him.

163
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,293
We can't protect you in
there. I don't like it.

164
00:09:38,294 --> 00:09:42,716
- I'll be fine. I have to try.
- I'll watch over her as she meditates.

165
00:09:42,717 --> 00:09:45,351
I guess in the meantime,
Mako and I will stay here

166
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:46,745
and try to get through to the temple.

167
00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:48,269
We'll help Su ready the airship.

168
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:53,042
I'm going to take a nap.

169
00:10:03,308 --> 00:10:06,307
Zaheer, come out! Face me!

170
00:10:06,308 --> 00:10:09,308
Leave the airbenders out of this.

171
00:10:15,308 --> 00:10:16,824
There you are.

172
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:20,030
Please don't hurt me, Korra.

173
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,939
I'm just an old man.

174
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,489
Iroh? What are you doing here?

175
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,518
I was just out searching for a new teapot

176
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,976
to add to my collection,
but instead I found you.

177
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:37,390
In the Spirit World, you
always seem to find something

178
00:10:37,391 --> 00:10:39,850
you didn't know you were looking for.

179
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,307
You look troubled.

180
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:46,308
- I am.
- Sit.

181
00:10:48,308 --> 00:10:49,933
What is on your mind?

182
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:51,414
There's a maniac on the loose,

183
00:10:51,415 --> 00:10:53,613
and he's threatening to
destroy the new Air Nation.

184
00:10:54,008 --> 00:10:55,616
I don't know what to do.

185
00:10:55,617 --> 00:11:01,248
Just because you are the Avatar doesn't
mean you will have all the answers.

186
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:03,524
I know many avatars have needed guidance,

187
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:05,906
but I'm the only one since Avatar Wan

188
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:08,111
that can't get help from my past lives.

189
00:11:08,112 --> 00:11:10,036
I wish I could talk to Aang.

190
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:13,923
You know, Zuko and Aang were close friends.

191
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:18,662
- Lord Zuko, of course.
- Yes, my nephew.

192
00:11:18,697 --> 00:11:23,013
Their relationship
started off a little rocky,

193
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:26,227
but they grew to become lifelong friends.

194
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,183
Best friends.

195
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,207
Thank you. Thank you so much.

196
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,207
You're right about the Spirit World.

197
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:37,617
I came here looking for someone
else, but I'm glad I found you.

198
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,207
- Did you find Zaheer?
- No, he wasn't there.

199
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,208
But there's someone I need to talk to.

200
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,407
You're leaving?

201
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:53,407
Aren't you coming to
the air temple with us?

202
00:11:53,408 --> 00:11:55,407
I'm sorry, but I can't.

203
00:11:55,408 --> 00:11:57,407
I'm going back to the Fire Nation.

204
00:11:57,408 --> 00:12:00,407
If it's true that the
Red Lotus is targeting

205
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:03,407
the nation's leaders, I
need to protect my daughter.

206
00:12:03,408 --> 00:12:06,407
I understand, you have to
keep the Fire Lord safe.

207
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:08,407
But before you leave,

208
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:10,407
I was wondering if you
could help me with something.

209
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:13,407
I was often Aang's council,
and I'd love to be yours.

210
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:16,407
That's just it, you knew
Aang better than anyone.

211
00:12:16,408 --> 00:12:20,407
I was wondering if you knew what he
might do if he were in my situation.

212
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:25,407
Rebuilding the Air Nation
was Aang's biggest dream.

213
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:28,407
He would be beside himself
with joy with what you've done,

214
00:12:28,408 --> 00:12:31,407
and if he accomplished that goal,

215
00:12:31,408 --> 00:12:34,407
he might have sacrificed
anything to protect it.

216
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:37,829
So he would give himself
up to save the Air Nation?

217
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,633
I don't know for sure.

218
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,407
The airbenders might have
been closest to Aang's heart,

219
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:47,407
but as the Avatar, he was concerned
with people of all nations.

220
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:50,407
No one knew better than
Aang that in times of turmoil

221
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:54,407
the world needs its Avatar the most.

222
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:56,407
Thanks. Your Uncle was right.

223
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,407
It was helpful talking to you.

224
00:12:58,408 --> 00:13:01,407
Wait, you spoke with my Uncle?

225
00:13:01,408 --> 00:13:04,407
Yes, in the Spirit World.

226
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,408
A couple of times actually.

227
00:13:07,408 --> 00:13:09,408
Guys, we got through to the air temple.

228
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:12,408
Who is this?

229
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:15,407
I told you, it's Bolin!

230
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:18,407
Bolin's not here right
now, can I take a message?

231
00:13:18,408 --> 00:13:21,407
No, I'm not looking for Bolin, I am Bolin!

232
00:13:21,408 --> 00:13:24,407
Ahh, look, I need you to find your dad.

233
00:13:24,408 --> 00:13:25,408
He's outside with the bison.

234
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:29,407
Did you know we found a
whole herd full of baby bison?

235
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,407
No. A whole herd, really?

236
00:13:33,409 --> 00:13:35,407
Meelo, this is your commanding officer.

237
00:13:35,408 --> 00:13:36,408
Go get your dad, now.

238
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:38,408
Yes, Sir.

239
00:13:40,408 --> 00:13:43,407
Come on. Come on.

240
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:45,407
Hello, this is Tenzin.

241
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,408
Tenzin, listen to me carefully.

242
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,407
Zaheer is on his way to the temple.

243
00:13:48,408 --> 00:13:49,408
He's coming for the airbenders.

244
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:52,407
You have to get everyone
out of there immediately.

245
00:13:52,408 --> 00:13:54,407
Drop everything. Leave now!

246
00:13:54,408 --> 00:13:58,407
- Oh, no.
- What? What is it?

247
00:13:58,408 --> 00:14:00,407
Tenzin! Tenzin, what's happening?

248
00:14:00,408 --> 00:14:03,407
It's too late.

249
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:06,408
He's here.

250
00:14:16,013 --> 00:14:18,012
What is it, daddy?

251
00:14:18,013 --> 00:14:20,012
We need to get everyone out of here.

252
00:14:20,013 --> 00:14:22,013
Stay close to me.

253
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:34,012
What's going on, Tenzin?

254
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:36,012
It's Zaheer. Round everyone up.

255
00:14:36,013 --> 00:14:39,013
We need to get to the bison
and evacuate immediately.

256
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:46,012
Guys, we got an emergency.

257
00:14:46,013 --> 00:14:50,012
We're evacuating the temple. Come on.

258
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:52,013
Look out!

259
00:15:00,013 --> 00:15:03,013
It's Zaheer. We have to leave.

260
00:15:07,013 --> 00:15:10,013
No one's going anywhere, or she gets it.

261
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:19,013
Good, the entire family is here.

262
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:31,012
It's a pleasure to finally
meet a true airbending master.

263
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,012
What is it you want from us?

264
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:34,013
Nothing at all.

265
00:15:34,014 --> 00:15:37,012
In fact, if everyone cooperates,

266
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:40,012
you will all walk out of
this situation unharmed.

267
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:41,013
Then what are you doing here?

268
00:15:41,014 --> 00:15:44,012
I want Korra, and I'm tired of chasing her.

269
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:47,012
- You're using us as leverage?
- Yes.

270
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,012
I will never let you get to Korra.

271
00:15:49,013 --> 00:15:53,012
Unfortunately, you don't have a choice.

272
00:15:53,013 --> 00:15:55,012
Yes, I do.

273
00:15:57,013 --> 00:15:59,012
Jinora, get everyone out of here.

274
00:15:59,013 --> 00:16:03,013
Bumi, Kya, help me hold them off.

275
00:16:09,013 --> 00:16:12,013
And stay out of her line of sight. Go. Go!

276
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:48,013
It's too dangerous we'll never make
it to the stables with her up there.

277
00:18:08,013 --> 00:18:10,013
No.

278
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:54,013
I see you're having as much fun as I am.

279
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:01,012
- I can't wait any longer.
- Wait, what are you doing?

280
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:03,012
Whatever I can.

281
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:05,013
Get to the bison! Get out of here!

282
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:51,013
Kai! No.

283
00:20:19,013 --> 00:20:21,012
I got you.

284
00:20:26,013 --> 00:20:28,012
Bumi, let go.

285
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:30,012
But we could die.

286
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:33,013
We're gonna die if we hang on.

287
00:21:31,013 --> 00:21:33,012
Give up. It's over.

288
00:21:33,013 --> 00:21:37,013
As long as I'm breathing, it's not over.

289
00:22:04,013 --> 00:22:05,013
Thanks, buddy.

290
00:22:05,014 --> 00:22:08,013
Yip yip.
