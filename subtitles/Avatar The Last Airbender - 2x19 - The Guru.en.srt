1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Water,

2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,447
Earth,

3
00:00:04,448 --> 00:00:06,197
Fire,

4
00:00:06,198 --> 00:00:08,602
Air

5
00:00:08,603 --> 00:00:13,133
Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.

6
00:00:13,134 --> 00:00:17,259
Then, everything changed
when the fire nation attacked.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,202
Only the avatar, master of all
four elements, could stop them.

8
00:00:22,203 --> 00:00:24,862
But when the world
needed him most, he vanished.

9
00:00:24,863 --> 00:00:29,319
100 years passed, and my brother and i
discovered the new avatar,

10
00:00:29,354 --> 00:00:30,876
an airbender named aang

11
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:33,531
And although his
airbending skills are great

12
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:36,259
He has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,278
But i believe aang
can save the world.

by om4gus. blogspot. com

00:00:45,623 --> 00:00:48,478
Man: previously on "avatar. "

16
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,578
["Previously on Avatar" sequence
includes clips from Appa's Lost Days,

17
00:00:53,613 --> 00:00:55,721
Avatar State,

18
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,586
and The Earth King]

19
00:01:45,892 --> 00:01:49,479
What's that smell?

20
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,349
It's jook. I'm sure you wouldn't like it.

21
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:00,760
Actually, it smells delicious.
I'd love a bowl, Uncle.

22
00:02:00,892 --> 00:02:06,554
Now that your fever is gone,
you seem different somehow.

23
00:02:06,555 --> 00:02:10,894
It's a new day. We've got
a new apartment, new furniture,

24
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,170
and today's the grand opening
of your new tea shop.

25
00:02:14,205 --> 00:02:15,168
Things are looking up Uncle.

26
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,345
You haven't seen your Dad in over two years.

27
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,105
You must be so excited.

28
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,895
i know i should be,
but i just feel sick to my stomach.

29
00:02:29,896 --> 00:02:32,879
Don't be nervous, he's going to be 
so happy to see you.

30
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,465
So what about you? 
Are you nervous to meet this Guru?

31
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:41,053
Not at all. I'm ready to master the Avatar State. 
I'll do whatever it takes.

32
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:46,017
See you in a week. Yip Yip!

33
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:04,280
Sokka, good to see you.

34
00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:25,102
Sokka.

35
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:26,885
Hi Dad

36
00:03:33,476 --> 00:03:40,417
Look Bosco, the Kyoshi Warriors 
are here to protect us. Aren't you excited?

37
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:46,354
It's been a difficult week for me. 
My most trusted advisor, Long Feng,

38
00:03:46,354 --> 00:03:49,900
and his Dai Li agents tried 
to take control of Ba Sing Se from me.

39
00:03:50,073 --> 00:03:53,476
It's terrible when you can't trust 
the people who are closest to you.

40
00:03:53,477 --> 00:03:54,987
But there is good news.

41
00:03:54,987 --> 00:04:01,041
As we speak, the Council of Five is meeting
to plan an invasion of The Fire Nation this summer. 

42
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,385
On the day of a solar eclipse.

43
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,705
Really? Now that sounds like a fascinating and brilliant plan.

44
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:24,489
General Fong's base will serve as the launching point of the attack.
In exactly two months, the Army and Navy will invade the Fire Nation on The Day of Black Sun.

45
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,131
Or we could send in Momo to do some damage.

46
00:04:28,132 --> 00:04:32,451
Cause the...
... sorry.

47
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:39,738
All we need is the Earth King's seal in order to execute the plan.

48
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:45,398
I'll get these scrolls to him right away. Thank you, General How.

49
00:05:02,686 --> 00:05:11,283
Um, hello?
You're Guru Pathik, right? The person who attached the note to Appa's horn?

50
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:18,158
Indeed. i was a spiritual brother of your people, and a personal friend of Monk Gyatso.

51
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:24,136
In your note, you said you could teach me to gain control of the Avatar State. How?

52
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:29,635
You must gain balance within yourself before you can bring balance to the world.

53
00:05:29,636 --> 00:05:33,540
And the first step to gaining balance begins with this.

54
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:36,578
Drink up!

55
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:41,490
Ugh! It tastes like onion and banana juice!

56
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:45,828
That's because it is.
Yum yum!

57
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:51,781
i believe we need to go right!

58
00:05:51,782 --> 00:05:55,174
What are you talking about? The Bei Fong Estate's this way.

59
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:57,759
I'm quite certain you're mistaken.

60
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,290
Hey! Can you two old ladies quit your bickering for a second? i gotta go to the bathroom!

61
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:07,754
Oh. Okay, but make it quick.

62
00:06:07,755 --> 00:06:10,143
What's wrong with you!

63
00:06:10,144 --> 00:06:16,995
Oh very sneaky Toph! Nice try, but you can't trick me.

64
00:06:16,996 --> 00:06:20,287
Let me out of here, so i can kick both your butts!

65
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:27,312
Quit your banging.
You might think you're the greatest earthbender in the world, but even you can't bend metal.

66
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,084
We have been presented with an extraordinary opportunity, girls.

67
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:44,678
Mai finally gets to wear makeup that's not totally depressing?

68
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:46,645
Ha. Ha.

69
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:50,244
I'm talking about conquering the whole Earth Kingdom.

70
00:06:50,245 --> 00:07:00,933
For a hundred years the fire nation has hammered away at Ba Sing Se from the outside.
But now we are on the inside, and we can take it by ourselves.

71
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:05,805
Gosh, you're so confident. i really admire that about you.

72
00:07:05,806 --> 00:07:11,009
From the inside we're in the perfect position to organize a coup and overthrow the Earth King.

73
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:17,351
The key is the Dai Li. Whoever controls the Dai Li, controls Ba Sing Se.

74
00:07:22,194 --> 00:07:27,498
In order to master the Avatar State, you must open all of the chakras.

75
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:31,563
Aang, tell me everything you know about chakras.

76
00:07:31,564 --> 00:07:32,564
What are chakras?

77
00:07:32,565 --> 00:07:38,080
Oh, i see. i guess we'll start with the basics.

78
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:44,009
The water flows through this creek much like the energy flows through your body.

79
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:52,491
As you see there are several pools where the water swirls around before flowing on.
These pools are like our charkas.

80
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:56,466
So chakras are pools of spiraling energy in our bodies?

81
00:07:56,467 --> 00:08:02,834
Exactly! If nothing else were around, this creek would flow pure and clear.

82
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:08,850
However, life is messy, and things tend to fall in the creek, and then what happens?

83
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:10,988
The creek can't flow?

84
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:15,696
Yes. But if we open the paths between the pools...

85
00:08:15,697 --> 00:08:18,546
The energy flows!

86
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:25,610
There are seven chakras that go up the body.

87
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:26,611
Each pool of energy has a purpose, and can be blocked by a specific kind of emotional muck.

88
00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:27,612
Be warned... opening the chakras is an intense experience,
and once you begin the process, you cannot stop until all seven are open.

89
00:08:27,613 --> 00:08:44,025
Are you ready?

90
00:08:44,026 --> 00:08:47,597
I'll do whatever it takes.

91
00:08:47,598 --> 00:08:57,328
First we will open the Earth chakra, located at the base of the spine.
It deals with survival and is blocked by fear.

92
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:03,362
What are you most afraid of? Let your fears become clear to you.

93
00:09:05,818 --> 00:09:09,199
Ahhhhh!

94
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:24,239
Aang, your vision is not real. You are concerned for your survival,
but you must surrender those fears.

95
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,677
Let your fears flow down the creek.

96
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:33,950
You have opened your Earth chakra.

97
00:09:43,122 --> 00:09:46,183
Next is the...
Water chakra?

98
00:09:46,184 --> 00:09:50,425
Brilliant! Maybe one day you will be a Guru too.

99
00:09:50,426 --> 00:10:00,734
This chakra deals with pleasure, and is blocked by guilt.
Now, look at all the guilt which burdens you so.

100
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:04,255
What do you blame yourself for?

101
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:09,406
i ran away.

102
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:22,487
i hurt all of those people.

103
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:30,516
Accept the reality that these things happened, but do not let them cloud and poison your energy.

104
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:37,730
If you are to be a positive influence on the world, you need to forgive yourself.

105
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:51,686
This bay leads directly to the outskirts of Ba Sing Se.
We've been using these tangle mines to stop the fire nation ships from getting through.

106
00:10:51,687 --> 00:10:54,901
You're father invented tangle mines himself.

107
00:10:54,902 --> 00:11:02,799
Destructive, buoyant, and
terrible smelling.

108
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,654
Very perceptive. The mines are filled with skunk-fish and seaweed.

109
00:11:07,655 --> 00:11:15,520
When a ship detonates the mine, the seaweed tangles up the propeller,
and the foul smell forces people to abandon the ship.

110
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:18,468
i call it the stink' n' sink.

111
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,156
Ha ha! Good one Dad!

112
00:11:21,157 --> 00:11:22,157
You are definitely your father's son.

113
00:11:22,158 --> 00:11:28,385
Hakoda, our scouts have spotted four fire nation ships.

114
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:29,386
Bato, get these mines loaded up. The rest of you men, prepare for battle!

115
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:37,325
Uh, what should i do, Dad?

116
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:41,732
Aren't you listening? i said the rest of you men get ready for battle.

117
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:57,216
Who thought when we came to this city as refugees,
that I'd end up owning my own tea shop.

118
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:02,470
Follow your passion Zuko, and life will reward you.

119
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,374
Congratulations Uncle.

120
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,816
I'm very thankful.

121
00:12:06,817 --> 00:12:11,396
You deserve it. The Jasmine Dragon will be the best tea shop in the city.

122
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:19,467
No, I'm thankful because you decided to share this special day with me.
It means more than you know.

123
00:12:21,578 --> 00:12:23,665
Now let's make these people some tea.

124
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,450
Yes! Let's make some tea!

125
00:12:32,964 --> 00:12:36,942
Third is the Fire chakra, located in the stomach.

126
00:12:36,943 --> 00:12:40,705
My Fire chakra would like to eat something other than onion-banana juice.

127
00:12:40,706 --> 00:12:44,203
He he. Good one.
Moving on.

128
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:49,753
This chakra deals with will power and is blocked by shame.

129
00:12:49,754 --> 00:12:56,262
What are you ashamed of? What are your biggest disappointments in yourself?

130
00:12:59,793 --> 00:13:03,542
I'm never going to fire bend again. i can't.

131
00:13:03,543 --> 00:13:13,869
You will never find balance if you deny this part of your life.
You are the Avatar, and therefore, you are a firebender.

132
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:26,720
Hmm, that chakra opened less like a flowing creek, and more like a burping bison.

133
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:34,456
Urrp! Tastes like onion and bananas, but strangely something else. Pickles?

134
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:47,351
I'm tired of wearing this girly disguise. i don't know how anyone can fight in this.

135
00:13:47,352 --> 00:13:51,454
Maybe that's why it was so easy to beat the Kyoshi Warriors and take their clothes.

136
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:59,105
How much longer do we have to serve the Earth King?
If i have to clean up one more pile of bear poop, I'm gonna throw up.

137
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:06,434
Princess Azula promised we would go back to the fire nation as soon as we captured the Avatar.
We just have to be patient.

138
00:14:06,435 --> 00:14:10,021
Shush up! Do you want the whole palace to know we're Fire Nation?

139
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:11,657
Sorry.

140
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:24,865
Good work girls.
i am sure the Dai Li will deliver the message.

141
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:33,750
The fourth chakra is located in the heart. It deals with love, and is blocked by grief.

142
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,153
Lay all your grief out in front of you.

143
00:15:02,671 --> 00:15:12,888
You have indeed felt a great loss. But love is a form of energy, and it swirls all around us.

144
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:17,720
The Air Nomads love for you has not left this world.

145
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:24,777
It is still inside of your heart,
and is reborn in the form of new love.

146
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:33,727
Let the pain flow away. Very good.

147
00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:38,048
Can i have some onion banana juice please?

148
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:52,409
The fifth in the chain is the Sound chakra, located in the throat.
It deals with truth, and is blocked by lies. The ones we tell ourselves.

149
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,135
Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?

150
00:15:55,136 --> 00:15:57,197
Because i never wanted to be.

151
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:04,599
You cannot lie about your own nature.
You must accept that you are the Avatar.

152
00:16:15,577 --> 00:16:21,875
Very good Aang.
You have opened the chakra of Truth.

153
00:16:21,876 --> 00:16:35,109
The sixth pool of energy is the Light chakra, located in the center of the forehead.
It deals with insight and is blocked by illusion.

154
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:46,181
The greatest illusion of this world is the illusion of separation.
Things you think are separate and different are actually one and the same.

155
00:16:46,182 --> 00:16:47,555
Like the four nations.

156
00:16:47,556 --> 00:16:54,284
Yes. We are all one people, but we live as if divided.

157
00:16:54,285 --> 00:16:58,202
We're all connected.
Everything is connected.

158
00:16:58,203 --> 00:17:03,599
That's right.
Even the separation of the four elements is an illusion.

159
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:11,149
If you open your mind, you will see that all the elements
are one. Four parts of the same whole.

160
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,150
Even metal is just a part of Earth, that has been purified and refined.

161
00:17:22,347 --> 00:17:30,247
Come on metal... budge.

162
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:33,243
Whoo! Toph, you rule!

163
00:17:37,284 --> 00:17:41,328
What do you say Momo? A cup of tea before we get back to the king?

164
00:17:44,502 --> 00:17:46,471
Table for two please.

165
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,855
Uncle, i need 2 jasmine, one green and one lychee!

166
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:53,324
I'm brewing as fast as i can!

167
00:18:03,393 --> 00:18:05,689
This is the last chakra isn't it?

168
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:12,780
Yes. Once you open this chakra, you will be able go in
and out of the Avatar State at will.

169
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:20,234
And when you are in the Avatar State, you will have complete control and
awareness of all your actions.

170
00:18:20,235 --> 00:18:21,928
Let's do this.

171
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:25,928
The Thought chakra is located at the crown of the head.

172
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:36,243
It deals with pure cosmic energy and is blocked by earthly attachment.
Meditate on what attaches you to this world.

173
00:18:42,043 --> 00:18:51,014
Now, let all of those attachments go. Let them flow down the river. Forgotten.

174
00:18:51,015 --> 00:18:55,986
What? Why would i let go of Katara? I... I.. i love her.

175
00:18:55,987 --> 00:19:03,164
Learn to let her go, or you cannot let the pure cosmic energy flow in from the universe.

176
00:19:03,165 --> 00:19:06,305
Why would i choose cosmic energy over Katara?

177
00:19:06,306 --> 00:19:11,635
How could it be a bad thing that i feel an attachment to her?
Three chakras ago, that was a good thing.

178
00:19:11,636 --> 00:19:14,331
You must learn to let go.

179
00:19:14,332 --> 00:19:23,934
Thank goodness you are here Suki. Something terrible is going on.
The Fire Nation has infiltrated the city.

180
00:19:23,935 --> 00:19:28,189
i just saw Prince Zuko and his Uncle!
We have to tell the Earth King right away!

181
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,190
Oh, don't worry. I'll be sure to let him know.

182
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:46,381
So, Zu Zu's in the city too. i think it's time for a family reunion.

183
00:19:46,382 --> 00:19:51,027
I'm sorry, but i can't let go of Katara.

184
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:59,706
Aang, to master the Avatar State, you must open all the chakras. Surrender yourself.

185
00:19:59,982 --> 00:20:02,844
Okay, I'll try.

186
00:20:07,148 --> 00:20:11,492
Now, think of your attachments and let them go.

187
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:12,493
Let the pure cosmic energy flow.

188
00:21:00,895 --> 00:21:03,827
Katara is in danger! i have to go.

189
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:08,706
No Aang! By choosing attachment, you have locked the chakra!

190
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:09,707
If you leave now you won't be able to go into the Avatar State at all!

191
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:28,124
It's another one of her tricks!

192
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:31,597
There's a giant whole in the box. How's that a trick?

193
00:21:31,598 --> 00:21:35,047
It's not! It's the real deal!

194
00:21:43,383 --> 00:21:49,247
i am the greatest earthbender in the world! Don't you two dunderheads ever forget it!

195
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:03,964
I'm going to be stuck in here forever with you, aren't I?

196
00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:06,541
i have to go to the bathroom.

197
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:11,740
Ready to go knock some Fire Nation heads?

198
00:22:11,741 --> 00:22:17,629
You don't know how much this means to me dad.
I'll make you proud, and I'll finally prove to you what a great warrior i am.

199
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,630
Sokka, you don't have to prove anything to me.

200
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:25,637
I'm already proud of you, and I've always known you were a great warrior.

201
00:22:25,638 --> 00:22:26,507
Really?

202
00:22:26,508 --> 00:22:30,700
Why do you think i trusted you to look after our tribe when i left?

203
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,363
This can't be good news.

204
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:59,003
What is this about?
Your agents show up in the middle of the night and drag me down here?

205
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:01,665
You will not treat a Kyoshi Warrior this way!

206
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:07,784
But you are not a Kyoshi Warrior, are you?
Princess Azula of the Fire Nation!

207
00:23:07,785 --> 00:23:08,886
What do you want?

208
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:16,171
i want to make a deal. It's time that i regain control of Ba Sing Se.
And you have something i need.

209
00:23:16,172 --> 00:23:17,830
Oh?

210
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:19,189
The Earth King's trust.

211
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,471
Why should i help you?

212
00:23:21,472 --> 00:23:25,316
Because i can get you the Avatar.

213
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:26,940
I'm listening.

214
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:34,495
A message from the royal palace.

215
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:40,413
I... i can't believe it.

216
00:23:40,414 --> 00:23:41,414
What is it Uncle?

217
00:23:41,415 --> 00:23:48,758
Great news! We've been invited to serve tea to the Earth King!

218
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:14,334
So, what kind of trouble is Katara in?

219
00:24:14,335 --> 00:24:17,745
i don't know. In my vision, i just knew she needed help.

220
00:24:17,746 --> 00:24:22,433
It would be nice if your Avatar powers could be just a little more specific from time to time.

221
00:24:22,434 --> 00:24:24,404
What is that?!

222
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,028
Need a ride?
Ahhh!

223
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:32,389
Oooo!

224
00:24:33,617 --> 00:24:40,683
The Earth King and The Council of Five do not trust the Dai Li.
They imprisoned your leader, Long Feng.

225
00:24:40,684 --> 00:24:47,206
Soon they will turn on all of you, and eliminate you.
Seizing power today is a matter of life and death.

226
00:24:47,207 --> 00:24:55,231
The coup must be swift and decisive. The Earth King,
and each of the five generals, must be taken out simultaneously.

227
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:59,494
Long Feng has placed you in my command while we overthrow the government.

228
00:24:59,495 --> 00:25:10,986
If i sense any disloyalty, any hesitation, any weakness at all, i will snuff it out. That is all.

229
00:25:14,352 --> 00:25:18,675
Nice speech Azula. It was pretty and poetic, but also scary in a good way.

230
00:25:18,676 --> 00:25:22,484
Yeah, i thought you were gonna make that one guy pee his pants.

231
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:27,513
There are still a few loose ends. The Avatar, and my brother and Uncle.

232
00:25:27,514 --> 00:25:28,514
Many times, i imagined myself here, at the threshold of the palace.
But i always thought i would be here as a conqueror... instead,

233
00:25:28,515 --> 00:25:45,067
we are the Earth Kings personal guests, here to serve him tea.
Destiny is a funny thing.

234
00:25:45,068 --> 00:25:46,633
It sure is Uncle.

235
00:25:46,634 --> 00:25:51,317
So how did it go with the Guru?
Did you master the Avatar State?

236
00:25:51,318 --> 00:25:56,942
If you leave now, you won't be able to go into the avatar state at all!

237
00:25:56,943 --> 00:25:58,291
Aang, are you ok?

238
00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:06,475
I'm great. It went great with the Guru.
i completely mastered the avatar state.

239
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:14,985
What's taking so long?

240
00:26:14,986 --> 00:26:18,242
Maybe the Earth King overslept.

241
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:23,228
Something's not right.

242
00:26:23,229 --> 00:26:27,753
It's tea time.

243
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,295
Azula!

244
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:37,380
Have you met the Dai Li? They're Earthbenders, but they have
a killer instinct that is so Firebender, i just love it!

245
00:26:37,381 --> 00:26:42,957
Did i ever tell you how i got the nickname the "Dragon of the West"?

246
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:46,205
I'm not interested in a lengthy anecdote, Uncle.

247
00:26:46,206 --> 00:26:48,702
It's more of a demonstration really.

248
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:13,591
Come on. You'll be fine.

249
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:18,264
No. I'm tired of running. It's time i faced Azula!

250
00:27:22,421 --> 00:27:27,621
You're so dramatic. What, are you going to do, challenge me to an Agni Kai?

251
00:27:27,622 --> 00:27:29,980
Yes! i challenge you!

252
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,094
No thanks.

253
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,913
Katara's fine. You have nothing to worry about.

254
00:27:49,914 --> 00:27:50,914
But, in my vision. i felt so sure that she was in trouble.

255
00:27:50,915 --> 00:28:00,882
Well, she met with the Council of Generals to plan the invasion.
And since then she's been off with your friends, the Kyoshi Warriors.

256
00:28:00,883 --> 00:28:06,176
See Aang? She's with Suki. They're probably back at our apartment right now,
talking about make up or something.

257
00:28:06,177 --> 00:28:08,510
Ok, maybe you're right.

258
00:28:08,545 --> 00:28:13,778
Believe me, if there was any danger at all,
Bosco's animal instinct would sense it.

259
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:24,672
You've got company.

260
00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:28,705
Zuko!

261
00:28:42,057 --> 00:28:43,528
Momo!

262
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:48,546
There's no one else here.

263
00:28:48,547 --> 00:28:50,923
Katara is in trouble! i knew it!

264
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:52,293
Oh no.

265
00:28:52,294 --> 00:28:56,037
Wait, someone's at the door.

266
00:28:56,038 --> 00:29:01,838
Actually, i know who it is. It's an old friend of mine.
Glad to see you're okay.

267
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,507
i need your help.

268
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:06,090
Huh uh?!

269
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:12,411
You guys know each other!

270
00:29:12,412 --> 00:29:17,014
i met him in the woods once and knocked him down.
Then he gave me tea and very good advice.

271
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:19,857
May i come in?

272
00:29:21,636 --> 00:29:24,918
Princess Azula is here in Ba Sing Se.

273
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:26,382
She must have Katara.

274
00:29:26,383 --> 00:29:28,947
She has captured my nephew as well.

275
00:29:28,948 --> 00:29:32,747
Then we'll work together to fight Azula, and save Katara and Zuko.

276
00:29:32,748 --> 00:29:35,817
Woah there. You lost me at, "Zuko".

277
00:29:35,818 --> 00:29:42,836
i know how you must feel about my nephew.
But believe me when i tell you there is good inside him

278
00:29:42,837 --> 00:29:47,482
Good inside of him isn't enough. Why don't you come back
when it's outside him too, okay?

279
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:53,462
Katara is in trouble. All of Ba Sing Se is in trouble.
Working together is our best chance.

280
00:29:53,463 --> 00:29:58,948
i brought someone along who might be able to help us.

281
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:12,293
Azula and Long Feng are plotting a coup. They're going to overthrow the Earth King.

282
00:30:12,294 --> 00:30:15,446
My sister! Where are they keeping Katara

283
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:19,021
In the crystal catacombs of old Ba Sing Se, deep beneath the palace.

284
00:30:19,022 --> 00:30:25,625
The movements of all the generals and the Earth King have been plotted out step by step.

285
00:30:25,626 --> 00:30:29,739
Good. And the Fire Nation Princess is cooperating?

286
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:39,760
Oh yes! More than cooperating, she's really taken charge.
She's terrifying and inspirational all at the same time. It's hard to explain.

287
00:30:44,535 --> 00:30:49,733
Why did they throw you in here?
Oh wait. Let me guess. It's a trap.

288
00:30:49,734 --> 00:30:54,457
So when Aang shows up to rescue me,
you can finally have him in your little Fire Nation clutches.

289
00:30:57,406 --> 00:31:04,565
You're a terrible person, you know that? Always following us,
hunting the Avatar, trying to capture the world's last hope for peace!

290
00:31:04,566 --> 00:31:11,583
But what do you care? You're the Fire Lord's son.
Spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood.

291
00:31:11,584 --> 00:31:13,202
You don't know what you're talking about.

292
00:31:13,203 --> 00:31:23,692
i don't?! How dare you! You have no idea what this war has put me through.
Me personally. The Fire Nation took my mother away from me.

293
00:31:23,693 --> 00:31:30,832
I'm sorry. That's something we have in common.

294
00:31:34,722 --> 00:31:39,677
Well whaddya know. There is an ancient city down there, but it's deep.

295
00:31:42,996 --> 00:31:48,010
We should split up. Aang, you go with Iroh to look for
Katara and the angry jerk... no offense.

296
00:31:48,011 --> 00:31:49,268
None taken.

297
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:50,269
And I'll go with Toph to warn the Earth King about Azula's coup.

298
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:05,776
So, Toph thinks you give pretty good advice. And great tea.

299
00:32:05,777 --> 00:32:09,914
The key to both is proper aging. What's on your mind?

300
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:19,802
Well, i met with this Guru who was supposed to help me
master the avatar state, and control this great power.

301
00:32:19,803 --> 00:32:20,803
But to do it, i had to let go of someone i love, and i just couldn't.

302
00:32:20,804 --> 00:32:32,622
Perfection and power are overrated. i think you were very wise to choose happiness and love.

303
00:32:32,623 --> 00:32:40,611
What happens if we can't save everyone and beat Azula?
Without the Avatar State, what if i am not powerful enough?

304
00:32:40,612 --> 00:32:53,570
i don't know the answer. Sometimes life is like this dark tunnel.
You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving...

305
00:32:53,571 --> 00:33:00,214
You will come to a better place.

306
00:33:20,702 --> 00:33:22,926
Arghh! What's going on here?!

307
00:33:22,927 --> 00:33:24,963
You're under house arrest.

308
00:33:24,964 --> 00:33:28,562
The coup is happening right now! We've got to warn the Earth King!

309
00:33:49,449 --> 00:33:50,946
Thank goodness we're in time!

310
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:52,333
In time for what?

311
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:58,049
Yeah, what are you in time for...
cutie?

312
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:01,135
Uh, I'm kinda involved with Suki.

313
00:34:01,136 --> 00:34:02,175
Who?

314
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:06,737
They're not the real Kyoshi Warriors!

315
00:34:06,738 --> 00:34:09,799
Sorry to disappoint you.

316
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:22,885
Ooo, it's like we're dancing together.

317
00:34:22,886 --> 00:34:26,099
This fight... is over.

318
00:34:32,202 --> 00:34:38,336
Get them all out of my sight.

319
00:34:50,095 --> 00:34:58,231
Now comes the part where i double-cross you.
Dai Li, arrest the Fire Nation Princess.

320
00:34:58,266 --> 00:35:03,803
i said, arrest her. What is wrong with you?

321
00:35:03,804 --> 00:35:08,484
It's because they haven't made up their minds.
They're waiting to see how this is going to end.

322
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:10,393
What are you talking about?

323
00:35:10,428 --> 00:35:14,594
i can see your whole history in your eyes.
You were born with nothing.

324
00:35:14,595 --> 00:35:24,610
So you had to struggle and connive and claw your way to power.
But true power... the divine right to rule... is something you're born with.

325
00:35:24,611 --> 00:35:31,622
The fact is, they don't know which one of us is going to be sitting
on that thrown and which one is going to be bowing down.

326
00:35:31,623 --> 00:35:37,373
But i know. And you know.
Well?

327
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:46,520
You've beaten me at my own game.

328
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:50,601
Don't flatter yourself. You were never even a player.

329
00:35:52,144 --> 00:35:54,520
I'm sorry i yelled at you before.

330
00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:55,879
It doesn't matter.

331
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:02,112
It's just that for so long now, whenever i would imagine
the face of the enemy, it was your face.

332
00:36:02,147 --> 00:36:04,544
My face. i see

333
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:06,884
No, no, that's not what i meant.

334
00:36:06,885 --> 00:36:10,184
It's ok. i used to think this scar marked me.

335
00:36:10,185 --> 00:36:14,195
The mark of the banished prince,
cursed to chase the Avatar forever.

336
00:36:14,196 --> 00:36:21,444
But lately, I've realized I'm free to determine
my own destiny, even if I'll never be free of my mark.

337
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:24,218
Maybe you could be free of it.

338
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:25,064
What?

339
00:36:25,065 --> 00:36:26,439
i have healing abilities.

340
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,090
It's a scar. It can't be healed.

341
00:36:29,091 --> 00:36:40,805
This is water from the Spirit Oasis at the North Pole. It has special properties,
so i have be saving it for something important. i don't know if it would work, but...

342
00:36:50,934 --> 00:36:53,966
Aang!

343
00:37:04,967 --> 00:37:07,263
Aang, i knew you would come.

344
00:37:07,264 --> 00:37:08,264
Uncle, i don't understand. What are you doing with the Avatar

345
00:37:08,265 --> 00:37:12,877
Saving you, that's what.

346
00:37:12,878 --> 00:37:19,570
Zuko, it's time we talked.
Go help your other friends. We'll catch up with you.

347
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:28,670
Why Uncle?

348
00:37:28,671 --> 00:37:36,653
You are not the man you used to be, Zuko. You are stronger
and wiser and freer than you have ever been.

349
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:45,614
And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny.
It's time for you to choose. It's time for you to choose good!

350
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:59,405
i expected this kind of treachery from Uncle, but Zuko, Prince Zuko...
you're a lot of things, but you're not a traitor, are you?

351
00:37:59,406 --> 00:38:01,399
Release him immediately!

352
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,658
It's not too late for you Zuko. You can still redeem yourself.

353
00:38:05,693 --> 00:38:09,112
The kind of redemption she offers is not for you.

354
00:38:09,113 --> 00:38:16,147
Why don't you let him decide, Uncle? i need you Zuko.
I've plotted every move of this day.

355
00:38:16,148 --> 00:38:21,445
This glorious day in Fire Nation history.
And the only way we win is together.

356
00:38:21,446 --> 00:38:24,948
At the end of this day, you will have your honor back.

357
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:29,431
You will have your father's love.
You will have everything you want.

358
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:37,284
Zuko, i am begging you, look into your heart
and see what it is that you truly want.

359
00:38:37,285 --> 00:38:39,945
You are free to choose.

360
00:38:52,217 --> 00:38:54,483
We've got to find Sokka and Toph.

361
00:39:50,005 --> 00:39:52,441
See any Dai Li agents near by?

362
00:39:52,442 --> 00:39:54,489
Nope. All clear.

363
00:39:58,212 --> 00:40:01,148
Let's go!

364
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,621
I'm not leaving without Bosco!

365
00:41:24,987 --> 00:41:27,013
i thought you had changed!

366
00:41:29,888 --> 00:41:31,889
i have changed.

367
00:41:58,647 --> 00:42:04,157
Come on, it's easy. You just walk on your front paws
instead of your rear ones. Like this.

368
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,946
That is a nice trick.

369
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:13,337
Just take the bear.

370
00:42:13,338 --> 00:42:15,410
Bosco!

371
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:12,048
There's too many.

372
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:16,572
The only way, is to let her go.

373
00:43:16,573 --> 00:43:19,067
I'm sorry Katara.

374
00:44:32,412 --> 00:44:37,729
You've got to get out of here! I'll hold them off as long as i can!

375
00:45:36,865 --> 00:45:42,922
We've done it Zuko. It's taken a hundred years,
but the Fire Nation has conquered Ba Sing Se.

376
00:45:42,957 --> 00:45:44,485
i betrayed Uncle.

377
00:45:44,486 --> 00:45:53,086
No, he betrayed you. Zuko, when you return home,
father will welcome you as a war hero.

378
00:45:53,087 --> 00:45:57,128
But i don't have the Avatar.
What if Father doesn't restore my honor?

379
00:45:57,129 --> 00:46:03,930
He doesn't need to Zuko. Today, you restored your own honor.

380
00:46:11,538 --> 00:46:16,190
The Earth Kingdom... has fallen.
