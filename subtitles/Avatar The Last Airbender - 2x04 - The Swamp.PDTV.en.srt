<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:17,575
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:21,888
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:25,048
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:29,210
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:31,050
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:36,989
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,612
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

Book Two: Earth
Chapter Four: The Swamp

15
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:11,411
Spare coins for weary travelers?

16
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:14,745
This is humiliating! We're royalty.

17
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:17,779
These people should be giving us whatever we want.

18
00:01:17,797 --> 00:01:22,078
They will... if you ask nicely.

19
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:26,706
Spare change for a hungry old man?

20
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:29,800
Aww, here you go.

21
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:37,117
The coin is appreciated, but not as much as your smile.

22
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,926
How about some entertainment in exchange for... a gold piece.

23
00:01:43,944 --> 00:01:46,192
We're not performers.

24
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:48,743
Not professional, anyway.

25
00:01:48,754 --> 00:01:59,864
♫ It's a long, long way to Ba Sing Se, but the girls in the city they look soo prett-ay! ♫

26
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:05,117
Come on! We're talking a gold piece here! Let's see some action!

27
00:02:05,128 --> 00:02:06,182
Dance!

28
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:17,666
♫ And they kiss so sweet that you've really got to meet the girls from Ba Sing Se! ♫

29
00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:25,229
Nothing like a fat man dancing for his dinner. Here ya go!

30
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:29,585
Such a kind man!

31
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:55,937
Hey, you takin' us down for a reason?

32
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:58,657
Aang! Why are we going down?

33
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:02,198
What? I didn't even notice.

34
00:03:02,205 --> 00:03:03,967
Are you noticing now?

35
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:05,103
Is something wrong?

36
00:03:05,112 --> 00:03:10,243
I know this is gonna sound weird, but... I think the swamp is... calling to me.

37
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:12,584
It is telling ya where we can get something to eat?

38
00:03:12,604 --> 00:03:16,428
No, I... I think it wants us to land there.

39
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:20,193
No offense to the swamp, but I don't see any land there to land on.

40
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:21,256
I don't know,...

41
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,437
Bumi said to learn earthbending I would have to wait and listen,...

42
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,269
...and now I'm actually hearing the earth. Do you want me to ignore it?

43
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:30,659
Yes!

44
00:03:30,664 --> 00:03:36,082
I don't know... There's something ominous about that place.

45
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:40,929
See? Even Appa and Momo don't like it here.

46
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:45,415
Okay, since everyone feels so strongly about this... bye swamp.

47
00:03:45,422 --> 00:03:47,406
Yip! Yip!

48
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:56,171
You better throw in an extra "yip"! We gotta move!

49
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:39,008
Where's Appa and Momo?

50
00:04:44,177 --> 00:04:48,234
Appa! Momo!

51
00:04:50,797 --> 00:04:52,790
Sokka! You've got an elbow leech!

52
00:04:52,803 --> 00:04:54,422
Where! Where!

53
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,573
Where do you think?

54
00:04:56,577 --> 00:05:00,744
Why do things keep attaching to me!

55
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:03,131
You couldn't find them?

56
00:05:03,147 --> 00:05:09,105
No... and the tornado... it just disappeared.

57
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:47,277
We better speed things up!

58
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:50,917
Maybe... we should be a little nicer to the swamp.

59
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:52,401
Aang, these are just plants!

60
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,063
Do you want me to say "please" and "thank you"...

61
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:56,482
...as I swing my machete back and forth?

62
00:05:56,493 --> 00:06:02,370
Maybe you should listen to Aang. Something about this place feels... alive.

63
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:05,068
I'm sure there are lots of things that are alive here,...

64
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:07,432
...and if we don't wanna wind up getting eaten by them,...

65
00:06:07,437 --> 00:06:11,373
...we need to find Appa as fast as we can.

66
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,039
Appa! Momo!

67
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:50,293
There's no way they can hear us and no way we can see them.

68
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:53,397
We'll have to make camp for the night.

69
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,179
What was that!?

70
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:04,524
Nothing. Just swamp gas. Look, there's nothing supernatural going on here.

71
00:07:07,855 --> 00:07:10,865
I think we should build a fire...

72
00:07:13,553 --> 00:07:17,356
Sokka, the longer we're here the more I think you shouldn't be doing that.

73
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:20,064
No, I asked the swamp. It said this was fine.

74
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:24,303
Right, swamp? "No problem, Sokka!"

75
00:07:29,394 --> 00:07:32,747
Does anyone else get the feeling that we're being watched?

76
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:36,610
Please, we're all alone out here.

77
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:44,399
...except for them.

78
00:07:44,406 --> 00:07:47,466
Right, except for them.

79
00:09:17,587 --> 00:09:19,653
Guys?

80
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,262
What'd you reckon make a track like that, Tho?

81
00:09:27,282 --> 00:09:33,451
Don't know, Due. Something with six legs. Pretty big'uns too.

82
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,855
Leaves a nice, wide trail to folla'.

83
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:39,430
You know what's at the end of that trail?

84
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,772
Dinner.

85
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:17,693
Aang? Sokka?

86
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:26,210
Hello? Hello? Can you help me?

87
00:10:26,214 --> 00:10:29,729
Mom? Mom!

88
00:10:32,573 --> 00:10:35,144
I can't believe...

89
00:10:44,734 --> 00:10:50,430
Aang! Stupid swamp! Dumb, ugly vines!

90
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:56,075
Katara! You think you're so tough, huh?

91
00:11:01,947 --> 00:11:03,921
Hello?

92
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:12,988
Yue? This is just a trick of the light...swamp gas...

93
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,255
...I... hit my head running away last night. I'm going crazy.

94
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:23,154
You didn't protect me.

95
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:37,952
Katara!

96
00:11:38,784 --> 00:11:40,880
Appa!

97
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:45,065
Hello? Who are you?

98
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:49,013
Hey, come back!

99
00:12:22,707 --> 00:12:27,386
Look at that, Tho. Is that little hairy fellow ridin' that thing?

100
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:29,603
Naw, that's what they call a "lemoo,"...

101
00:12:29,612 --> 00:12:33,384
...saw one at a travelin' show once. Real smart they say.

102
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:35,486
Bet he tastes a lot like possum chicken.

103
00:12:35,496 --> 00:12:38,235
You think everything tastes like possum chicken.

104
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:43,455
C'mon now, fellas. Just a little closer. Nice and easy.

105
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:48,260
Nothing to worry about. We just fixin' to eat ya.

106
00:12:48,274 --> 00:12:49,757
What'd ya say that fer?

107
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:50,974
Well, we are!

108
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:52,821
But you don't have to tell 'em that!

109
00:12:52,827 --> 00:12:54,853
Well how'd I know they'd understand me!

110
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,101
Come on!

111
00:13:23,617 --> 00:13:26,395
Who are you?

112
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:39,702
What do you guys think you're doing!? I've been looking all over for you!

113
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,305
Well, I've been wandering around looking for you!

114
00:13:42,315 --> 00:13:44,567
I was chasing some girl.

115
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:45,647
What girl?

116
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:49,957
I don't know. I heard laughing and I saw some girl in a fancy dress.

117
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,008
Well, there must be a tea party here and we just didn't get our invitations!

118
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:58,297
I thought I saw Mom.

119
00:13:58,942 --> 00:14:03,134
Look, we were all just scared and hungry and our minds were playing tricks on us.

120
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:04,978
That's why we all saw things out here.

121
00:14:04,987 --> 00:14:06,784
You saw something too?

122
00:14:06,794 --> 00:14:10,173
I thought I saw Yue. But, that doesn't prove anything.

123
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:15,073
Look, I think about her all the time, and you saw Mom, someone you miss a lot.

124
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:21,101
What about me? I didn't know the girl I saw. And all our visions led us right here.

125
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:24,482
Okay... so where's here? The middle of the swamp?

126
00:14:24,492 --> 00:14:28,685
Yeh, the center...

127
00:14:29,714 --> 00:14:34,068
It's the heart of the swamp, it's been calling us here, I knew it.

128
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,784
It's just a tree. It can't call anyone! For the last time,...

129
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:45,644
...there's nothing after us and there's nothing magical happening here.

130
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:20,075
Now what would a lemoo need a shirt fer?

131
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,382
There's someone in there! He's bending the vines!

132
00:17:49,138 --> 00:17:52,107
Why did you call me here if you just wanted to kill us?

133
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:57,587
Wait! I didn't call you here.

134
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:01,779
We were flying over and I heard something calling to me, telling me to land.

135
00:18:01,924 --> 00:18:05,050
He's the Avatar. Stuff like that happens to us... a lot.

136
00:18:05,055 --> 00:18:09,297
The Avatar! Come with me.

137
00:18:11,231 --> 00:18:13,897
So, who are you then?

138
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:16,996
I protect the swamp from folks that want to hurt it.

139
00:18:17,037 --> 00:18:19,424
Like this fellow with his big knife.

140
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,246
See? Completely reasonable.

141
00:18:21,257 --> 00:18:24,296
Not a monster, just a regular guy defending his home.

142
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:27,248
Nothing mystical about it.

143
00:18:27,262 --> 00:18:31,994
Oh, the swamp is a mystical place, all right. It's sacred.

144
00:18:32,008 --> 00:18:36,496
I reached enlightenment right here under the banion grove tree.

145
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:40,301
I hear it callin' me, just like you did.

146
00:18:40,308 --> 00:18:44,551
Sure ya did. It seems real chatty.

147
00:18:44,562 --> 00:18:49,793
See this whole swamp is actually just one tree spread out over miles...

148
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:55,513
...branches, spread and sink and take root and then spread some more...

149
00:18:55,531 --> 00:19:02,563
...one big living organism, just like the entire world.

150
00:19:02,572 --> 00:19:06,878
I get how the tree is one big thing, but, the whole world?

151
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:13,070
Sure. You think you're any different from me? Or your friends? Or this tree?

152
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:18,544
If you listen hard enough you can hear every living thing breathing together,...

153
00:19:18,545 --> 00:19:23,705
...you can feel everything growing. We're all livin' together,...

154
00:19:23,718 --> 00:19:28,726
...even if most folks don't act like it. We all have the same roots,...

155
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:32,397
...and we are all branches of the same tree.

156
00:19:32,408 --> 00:19:34,305
But what did our visions mean?

157
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:39,660
In the swamp we see visions of people we've lost, people we loved...

158
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:44,721
...folks we think are gone. But the swamp tells us they're not.

159
00:19:44,734 --> 00:19:51,025
We're still connected to 'em. Time is an illusion and so is death.

160
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:54,808
But what about my vision? It was someone I had never met.

161
00:19:54,813 --> 00:19:58,123
You're the Avatar. You tell me.

162
00:19:58,137 --> 00:20:06,297
Time is an illusion... so, it's... someone I will meet?

163
00:20:06,314 --> 00:20:10,007
Sorry to interrupt the lesson, but we still need to Appa and Momo.

164
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:16,712
I think I know how to find them. Everything is connected.

165
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:35,948
Come on! We've got to hurry!

166
00:20:35,975 --> 00:20:42,859
♫ Set my lines by the river bed! Caught ten fish and I killed'em dead! ♫

167
00:20:42,873 --> 00:20:45,795
♫ Cut 'em and gut'em and I tossed the heads... ♫

168
00:20:45,806 --> 00:20:51,583
♫ ...in the water to keep them cat gators dead. ♫

169
00:20:55,141 --> 00:20:57,298
Appa!

170
00:20:58,614 --> 00:21:01,040
We're under attack!

171
00:21:04,354 --> 00:21:07,130
Hey, you guys are waterbenders!

172
00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:11,933
You too? That means we're kin!

173
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,005
Hey Hue! How you been?

174
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:23,329
You know, scared some folks, swung some vines, the usual.

175
00:21:23,342 --> 00:21:25,500
Hue?

176
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:30,352
How you like that possum chicken?

177
00:21:30,368 --> 00:21:32,602
Tastes just like arctic hen.

178
00:21:32,613 --> 00:21:35,195
So why were you guys so interested in eating Appa?

179
00:21:35,214 --> 00:21:37,997
You've got plenty of those big things wandering around.

180
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:43,160
You want me to eat old Slim? He's like a member of the family!

181
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:45,542
Nice Slim!

182
00:21:47,386 --> 00:21:51,213
Oh, oh, he don't eat no bugs! That's people food.

183
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,793
Where d'you say you're from?

184
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,088
The South Pole.

185
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,764
Didn't know there was waterbenders anywhere but here.

186
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,899
They got a nice swamp there, do they?

187
00:21:58,905 --> 00:22:02,375
No, it' all ice and snow.

188
00:22:02,396 --> 00:22:04,360
Hmm. No wonder you left.

189
00:22:04,377 --> 00:22:08,540
Well, I hope you realize now that nothing strange was going on here.

190
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:11,140
Just a bunch of greasy people living in a swamp.

191
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:12,850
What about the visions?

192
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:19,383
I told you, we were hungry. I'm eating a giant bug!

193
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:23,776
But what about when the tree showed me where Appa and Momo were?

194
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,225
That's Avatar stuff, that doesn't count.

195
00:22:26,236 --> 00:22:29,949
The only thing I can't figure out is how you made that tornado that sucked us down.

196
00:22:29,966 --> 00:22:36,182
I can't do anything like that. I just bender the water in the plants.

197
00:22:36,196 --> 00:22:38,100
Well, no accounting for weather.

198
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:43,615
Still, there's absolutely nothing mysterious about the swamp.

199
00:22:56,807 --> 00:22:59,499
Who's there?

200
00:23:08,992 --> 00:23:12,481
