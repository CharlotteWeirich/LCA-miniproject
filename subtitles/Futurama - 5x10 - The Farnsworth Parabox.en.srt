one more flip.

300
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:57,247
-So heads or tails?
-You know, let's just say it's heads.

301
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:01,491
Ready? One.

302
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:05,487
Two. Three. Pull!

303
00:20:07,613 --> 00:20:13,370
There. That space-time eversion
has given us their box, and vice versa.

304
00:20:13,573 --> 00:20:15,882
What you think you just explained
to us, is that--

305
00:20:16,093 --> 00:20:20,484
Correct!
This box contains our own universe!

306
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:23,968
Sweet honeybee of infinity!

307

00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:33,568
Bender, quit destroying the universe!

309
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,125
But-- Oh!

310
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:40,811
Yes, all that is and ever shall be
is in that box.

311
00:20:41,013 --> 00:20:44,005
And the box itself
is probably worth something too.

312
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:48,644
We must cherish it
as we cherish every moment of our lives.
