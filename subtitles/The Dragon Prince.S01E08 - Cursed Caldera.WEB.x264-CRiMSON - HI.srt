in the lair
of the Dragon King and Queen...

00:00:28,682 --> 00:00:30,867
they kept this close to where they slept.

10
00:00:30,935 --> 00:00:32,435
It must be important.

11
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:33,591
Oh, no.

12
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,849
Something's wrong with the egg.

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,401
I'm afraid it's dying.

14
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:39,638
Wait!

15
00:00:39,818 --> 00:00:43,537
We learned about a miracle healer.
Someone who might be able to help the egg.

16
00:00:43,622 --> 00:00:45,612
- And maybe your hand too!
- Really?

17
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:47,780
The only catch is,
the healer lives up there...

18
00:00:47,867 --> 00:00:49,047
the Cursed Caldera.

19
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,969
There she is! She's an elf!

[mob clamoring]

21

Forget it.
No point following them up there.

22
00:00:59,713 --> 00:01:01,831
They'll never make it out alive.

[sarcastically] Safe? Sure.

29

So, how are we supposed to find
this miracle healer?

I'll help you find her.

- This way!
- [Ava barking]

33
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:24,544
So...

34
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:25,753
Hi, there.

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,677
But who are you exactly?

36
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:30,717
Me? I'm Ellis, and this is Ava.

37
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:32,098
- She's a wolf.
- [panting]

Wolf? Really? I thought bird.

00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:39,147
Oh, I should have introduced you guys.

40
00:02:39,234 --> 00:02:43,274
Ellis, this is Rayla,
who we originally met because, uh...

41
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:48,112
Well, she broke into our castle,
trying to kill Ezran.

42
00:02:49,656 --> 00:02:53,034
But it doesn't matter.
We're past that now.

43
00:02:53,326 --> 00:02:56,746
People meet in so many interesting ways!

44
00:02:56,913 --> 00:03:00,038
Hmm. So how do we find this healer?

45
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:03,505
Truth is, I never found her. She found us.

46
00:03:03,592 --> 00:03:08,925
We were hiding in a big, twisty,
hollow tree. Up near the rim.

47
00:03:09,342 --> 00:03:12,389
Then we need to get to that tree.
Even if it takes all night.

48
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:15,887
Wait... that's all we have to go on?

49
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:20,146
A weird tree, where this miracle healer
showed up three years ago?

50
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,941
It's our only chance. Got a better idea?

51
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:25,066
As a matter of fact...

52
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,526
I do not.

53
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:28,316
I'll get us to that tree.

54
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:31,110
The healer will find us there,
and she'll save the egg!

55
00:03:31,197 --> 00:03:32,784
And maybe she can help your hand.

56
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:37,036
Don't worry about my hand.
The egg is all that matters now.

It's like the sky is painted with honey.

Wow.

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,914

the nightmare's about to begin.

[stammers] What do you mean?

63
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:28,715
Oh, you know, enormous monsters,
indescribable terrors.

64
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,256
Stuff like that.

65
00:04:30,465 --> 00:04:32,300
- Stuff like that.
- Yeah.

66
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:35,511
And the higher we go, the worse it'll get.

67
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:38,428
All right! Well, let's go.

68
00:04:38,515 --> 00:04:40,769
No, no, no, wait.
We're going to need a plan.

69
00:04:40,856 --> 00:04:43,766
How do you plan for indescribable terrors?

70
00:04:43,853 --> 00:04:47,317
I feel like you need to be
able to describe them first.

71
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:51,527
Um... horrifying! Blood-curdling.

72
00:04:51,694 --> 00:04:55,111
Creepy, but in a super extreme way

73
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:58,492
that feels like it's lighting
your soul on fire.

74
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:00,533
I think that helps.

75
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,625
Wait! Wait, wait, wait! I've got it.

76
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:07,460
Flash! Woof! Whoosh! Slish-slash!

77
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:11,589
Awesome!

78
00:05:11,676 --> 00:05:14,005
Um, is he okay?

79
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:17,261
I think he's finally cracked
under the pressure.

80
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,885
No, that's the plan.

81
00:05:18,972 --> 00:05:20,678
Ezran, you have the first job.

82
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:24,479
You hold Bait in the air so he can flash
and blind whatever monster it is.

83
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:25,808
Whack!

84
00:05:25,895 --> 00:05:28,770
Wait... but then I'm not really
doing anything.

85
00:05:28,857 --> 00:05:30,485
I'm just kind of holding up Bait.

86
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:33,983
You're support!
Every team needs a great support.

87
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,026
Ellis, you're next.

88
00:05:35,113 --> 00:05:38,493
Ava will bark, and you'll ride around
in circles to confuse the monster.

89
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,990
- [barks]
- I don't know.

90
00:05:41,077 --> 00:05:44,582
Do you think you can run around
and bark a lot, Ava?

91
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:46,829
- [barking]
- She's ready!

92
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:50,708
Then, me, I'll use my windbreath spell.
Whoosh!

93
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:53,127
[gasps] You're going to cast a spell?

94
00:05:53,214 --> 00:05:56,547
It's just a simple rune thing I picked up.
No big deal.

95
00:05:56,634 --> 00:05:58,680
Yeah, he's going to blow on the monster.

96
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:00,760
Ruffle its fur real good.

97
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:03,601
It's either that, or the half
of the lightning spell I know.

98
00:06:03,688 --> 00:06:07,105
Specifically, the half that doesn't
shoot lightning out of my fingertips.

99
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:09,480
That monster won't know what hit it!

100
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:12,318
Oh, wait, it will. It'll be wind.

101
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,107
- [laughs]
- Rayla!

102
00:06:15,194 --> 00:06:16,948
You're last. The finisher.

103
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:22,245
You'll take down the blinded, distracted,
windblown monster with your blades.

104
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:24,283
Slish-slash!

105
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,993
My hand is in pretty bad shape.

106
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,209
I'm only going to be able
to use one blade.

107
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:31,165
Okay, then you're just... slash!

108
00:06:31,252 --> 00:06:34,549
No way. That won't work.
This is my slish hand.

109
00:06:34,636 --> 00:06:36,420
Uh, really?

110
00:06:36,507 --> 00:06:39,510
- No, not really, dummy.
- [Ezran laughs]

111
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:45,137
Wait. Callum, you may be a dummy,
but you're not a fool!

112
00:06:45,224 --> 00:06:46,769
Am I supposed to feel flattered by this?

113
00:06:46,856 --> 00:06:51,274
You said Claudia called you a fool
when you interrupted her lightning spell.

114
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:54,652
But I'll bet she was actually
trying to say "fulminis."

115
00:06:54,739 --> 00:06:57,319
It's the draconic word for lightning.

116
00:06:57,528 --> 00:06:59,908
So, if "fulminis" is the trigger word...

117
00:06:59,995 --> 00:07:02,366
Then you know the spell for lightning!

118
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:05,663
Revised plan!

119
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,582
Flash! Woof! Zap! Slash!

120
00:07:11,668 --> 00:07:13,169
[Rayla sighs]

121
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:50,873
If you don't eat, you'll die.

122
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,751
I am already dead.

123
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,920
You don't look dead.

124
00:07:56,546 --> 00:07:59,590
Though that hand has seen better days.

125
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:04,180
I went out of my way to acquire
some rare Xadian fruits.

126
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:08,349
They're remarkable! So strange and exotic.

127
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,062
And these Xadian oranges... no seeds.

128
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:15,022
Incredible.

129
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:18,901
No?

130
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:26,113
I understand the whole
honor-in-not-eating thing,

131
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,369
but at least drink something.

132
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,585
Don't worry, it's berry juice.

133
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:39,839
[sighs]

134
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:42,672
I have a proposition.

135
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:46,848
I simply want you to take a look
at an object, and tell me what it does.

136
00:08:46,935 --> 00:08:52,309
After that, I will unchain you
and you can walk out of here.

137
00:08:55,313 --> 00:08:56,602
Decide.

138
00:08:56,689 --> 00:09:01,068
You can be free,
or you can sit here and die.

139
00:09:01,155 --> 00:09:02,530
I told you.

140
00:09:02,617 --> 00:09:05,406
I am already dead.

141
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,196
[sighs]

142
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:10,786
Yes, wait a second.
I think I've heard about this.

143
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:13,953
It's a Moonshadow elf thing, right?

144
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,378
A philosophy of accepting you are
already dead...

145
00:09:17,465 --> 00:09:20,254
so you will not fear death.

146
00:09:23,216 --> 00:09:25,887
What a beautiful challenge
you've given me.

147
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:29,638
I must come up with something
you will fear...

148
00:09:30,264 --> 00:09:32,766
more than death.

149
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:43,861
[Gren] Excuse me.
I would love to try some Xadian fruit.

150
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:47,364
Very good.

151
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:02,043
Well, it's dark,

152
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,259
but I think the scariest thing
I've seen so far is an angry cricket.

153
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:07,762
And he's more, like, mildly annoyed.

154
00:10:07,849 --> 00:10:09,508
[cricket chirping]

155
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:12,887
Yeah, are you sure this is
the Cursed Caldera?

156
00:10:12,974 --> 00:10:15,770
Or did we accidentally
wander up Humdrum Hill?

157
00:10:15,857 --> 00:10:17,308
[all laughing]

158
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:22,313
Maybe we took a wrong turn
and wound up on Sleepy Slope?

159
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,690
- [all laughing]

I'll have to check my map,

161
00:10:26,446 --> 00:10:29,867
but I'm fairly certain I recognize
the unmistakable topography of...

162
00:10:29,954 --> 00:10:31,411
Mount Monotonous!

163
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,035
[dead silence]

164
00:10:33,286 --> 00:10:37,915
[cricket chirping]

165
00:10:38,624 --> 00:10:44,585
Anyway, it is a little odd
that nothing bad has happened yet.

166
00:10:44,672 --> 00:10:47,716
- I see a huge, scary monster!
- [yelps]

167
00:10:48,843 --> 00:10:51,178
But don't worry, it's dead.

168
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:53,266
Then why did you say it like that?

169
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:56,725
- Say it like what?
- [echoing]

170
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:02,523
[Ezran] I've never seen
anything like this.

171
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:06,568
- And look at those circles.
- [Callum] Don't touch it.

172
00:11:06,777 --> 00:11:08,406
What a strange birthmark.

173
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:10,990
I don't think that's a birthmark.

174
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:13,283
It's a bite mark!

175
00:11:13,993 --> 00:11:17,535
You're right.
Something's drained all its blood.

176
00:11:17,622 --> 00:11:18,499
[Ellis] Guys!

177
00:11:18,586 --> 00:11:20,496
[growling]

178
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:23,462
[Ellis] I see a huger, scarier monster!

179
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,959
[roaring]

180
00:11:25,046 --> 00:11:27,592
The plan! Time for the plan! Ezran?

181
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,755
Okay. Okay. Where's Bait?

182
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:31,342
[cricket chirping]

183
00:11:31,594 --> 00:11:33,222
Bait, come on, you're supposed to...

184
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:35,636
Ahh! Too soon! Too soon!

185
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:36,893
I can't see!

186
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,268
None of us can.

187
00:11:40,811 --> 00:11:42,730
[Ava barking]

188
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:49,447
Okay, what about the rest of the plan?

189
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:52,781
I probably shouldn't do lightning
if I can't see, right?

190
00:11:52,868 --> 00:11:54,825
Don't do the lightning!

191
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:56,367
Maybe a new plan?

192
00:11:57,078 --> 00:11:58,325
Scatter! Run!

193
00:11:58,412 --> 00:12:00,247
Is that to distract the monster?

194
00:12:00,831 --> 00:12:03,500
[Callum] No, it's just to get away
and live!

195
00:12:06,504 --> 00:12:08,213
[Rayla] Come with me.

196
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:10,760
Hop on. Ava will get us out of here.

197
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:12,426
[roaring]

198
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:29,195
You can climb trees right?

199
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:30,236
[roaring]

200
00:12:38,286 --> 00:12:39,287
[grunting]

201
00:12:56,762 --> 00:12:58,722
[Rayla] What do we do now?

202
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:02,144
I think that thing
is waiting for us down there.

203
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:04,645
We don't even have that much blood!

204
00:13:04,732 --> 00:13:09,566
I know.
We would be a very unsatisfying snack.

205
00:13:09,692 --> 00:13:11,315
[roaring]

206
00:13:11,402 --> 00:13:14,446
We don't have a choice.
We just have to wait it out.

207
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:18,116
Ugh, I'm sorry my plan was a mess.

208
00:13:18,284 --> 00:13:23,369
Nah, your plan was fine!
Our execution was a little off.

209
00:13:23,456 --> 00:13:27,000
It came out more like,
"Argh! Oops! Help! Run!"

210
00:13:44,894 --> 00:13:50,026
In a moment, I will remove this cover,
and you will tell me what you know.

211
00:13:50,113 --> 00:13:51,817
Understood?

212
00:13:55,404 --> 00:13:59,660
I've brought something that I hope
you will find motivating.

213
00:13:59,747 --> 00:14:01,699
[coins jingling]

214
00:14:01,786 --> 00:14:04,746
You're more foolish than I thought.

215
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:08,044
Don't you know only humans can be bribed?

216
00:14:08,131 --> 00:14:09,879
Oh, this isn't a bribe.

217
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:11,380
[coins clattering]

218
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,088
It's a threat.

219
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:16,174
Go on. Take a closer look.

220
00:14:17,218 --> 00:14:18,929
You're a monster.

221
00:14:19,016 --> 00:14:23,223
You're mistaken. I'm a pragmatist.

222
00:14:27,645 --> 00:14:30,147
It seems to be hanging in there.

223
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:31,649
Barely.

224
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:34,487
I'm so sorry I messed up the plan.

225
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:37,237
Ah, you should cut yourself a break.

226
00:14:37,363 --> 00:14:39,865
Everyone messes up sometimes.

227
00:14:39,952 --> 00:14:42,615
Or in my case, all the times.

228
00:14:42,702 --> 00:14:43,866
What are you talking about?

229
00:14:43,953 --> 00:14:46,702
Trust me, if the plan hadn't gotten
messed up when Bait flashed,

230
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:48,959
I'm sure it would have flopped
when it was my turn.

231
00:14:49,046 --> 00:14:53,253
Are you kidding? From what I can tell,
you're awesome at everything.

232
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:56,548
Well, it's true.
I am pretty awesome at everything.

233
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,928
Right up until the moment
when it really matters.

234
00:15:01,178 --> 00:15:04,389
And that's when I just... poof,
screw things up.

235
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:05,971
What do you mean?

236
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:07,520
- I don't know.
- [Bait grunts]

237
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:12,316
I hesitate, think too much,
get confused about the right thing to do.

238
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:15,317
And the next thing I know, I failed.

239
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,034
[monster growling]

240
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:30,287
I can't believe you're a mage.
I've never met an actual mage before.

241
00:15:30,374 --> 00:15:32,128
You're not at all what I expected.

242
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:37,925
- What were you expecting?
- You know, taller, long robes, wrinklier.

243
00:15:38,012 --> 00:15:40,547
- Super smart.
- [chuckling]

244
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:44,388
And maybe like a weird amulet
or something?

245
00:15:45,097 --> 00:15:48,769
Well, I am in the market for
a weird amulet, if you know anybody.

246
00:15:48,856 --> 00:15:51,558
[laughs] And you're so confident!

247
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:53,977
It's funny to hear someone say that.

248
00:15:54,064 --> 00:15:55,776
I don't think of myself as confident.

249
00:15:55,863 --> 00:16:00,821
Really? You should be,
having all that incredible power.

250
00:16:00,946 --> 00:16:04,201
Maybe. The truth is, it's not me.

251
00:16:04,288 --> 00:16:05,367
It's this.

252
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:09,248
All the magic, all the power,
all the confidence...

253
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:13,542
It's just because of this amazing thing.
A Primal Stone!

254
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:24,094
The morning I came to your castle,
my team was discovered by a human guard.

255
00:16:26,138 --> 00:16:30,058
It was my job to chase him down
and stop him.

256
00:16:32,812 --> 00:16:34,771
- But when I caught him...
- Please!

257
00:16:35,105 --> 00:16:38,608
He looked up at me, and he was
so afraid.

258
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:46,283
And then I just let him go.

259
00:16:52,456 --> 00:16:55,252
- I don't know why.
- Because you felt for him.

260
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:58,130
But he was a human... my enemy.

261
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,590
Yeah, but then you saw he was scared.

262
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:04,929
And you knew he was a person,
just like you.

263
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:08,844
That shouldn't have mattered.
I had a job to do.

264
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:12,102
Do you realize
I'm an assassin who's never killed anyone?

265
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:14,478
Uh, I think that's a good thing.

266
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,361
And by the way,
thanks for failing at your mission.

267
00:17:20,448 --> 00:17:22,107
I like being alive.

268
00:17:22,194 --> 00:17:24,237
I'm glad you're alive, Ezran.

269
00:17:24,446 --> 00:17:27,407
Knowing you is definitely worth
losing a hand for.

270
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:31,580
That's the weirdest, nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

271
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:34,625
Well, who knows,
maybe this is my unlucky hand,

272
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:37,498
so when it falls off, my luck will change!

273
00:17:37,585 --> 00:17:40,089
- [Ezran] That's horrible.
- Funny, though?

274
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:42,172
[Ezran] Funny and horrible.

275
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:47,555
[Ellis] That Primal Stone needs you
to do all that amazing stuff.

276
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:50,972
Without you, it's just a neat, glowy ball.

277
00:17:51,682 --> 00:17:52,930
I guess so.

278
00:17:53,017 --> 00:17:56,019
But without this, I'm nothing.

279
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:00,482
Just a guy who can draw and make
wry comments from time to time.

280
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:02,651
And they're not even that wry.

281
00:18:02,985 --> 00:18:04,942
I'm not convinced.

282
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:10,659
I have a feeling you'd be pretty amazing
even without your magic ball.

283
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:12,913
Well, you seem pretty great, too.

284
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,828
- [Ava barks]
- And Ava's also great.

285
00:18:15,915 --> 00:18:16,792
Is it okay if I pet her?

286
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:18,497
- [barks]
- Whoa!

287
00:18:18,584 --> 00:18:22,960
Aww, you're such a fuzzy wuv-munkin!
[chuckles]

288
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:28,218
[Rayla yelling] Hey, guys?
I think that thing might be gone!

289
00:18:38,062 --> 00:18:41,233
Haven't seen it or heard it in a while.
Seems like it moved on.

290
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,021
See ya, sucker!

291
00:18:43,108 --> 00:18:45,649
Get it? Because it's a giant leech?

292
00:18:45,736 --> 00:18:49,865
- So, more of a description than an insult?
- A little of both.

293
00:18:50,115 --> 00:18:51,363
Mmm-hmm.

294
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,658
It's probably gone,
but let's not taunt it, okay?

295
00:18:54,745 --> 00:18:58,042
There's a little thing called irony,
where just as you say one thing,

296
00:18:58,129 --> 00:19:01,629
like you're really sure about it,
that's when the opposite happens.

297
00:19:01,716 --> 00:19:04,214
Nah. Maybe that's how things
work in stories,

298
00:19:04,301 --> 00:19:05,674
but in the real world...

299
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:08,592
- [screeches]
- [all screaming]

300
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,350
[Ezran screams]

301
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:20,144
[both scream]

302
00:19:21,021 --> 00:19:22,814
[monster roars]

303
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:34,910
[Ezran screams]

304
00:19:37,871 --> 00:19:39,328
[Ellis] That way!

305
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:41,997
Focus! We can do this! The plan!

306
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:43,877
Ez and Bait, you're up!

307
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:47,171
Flash!

308
00:19:48,882 --> 00:19:50,967
[monster shrieking]

309
00:19:55,556 --> 00:19:58,350
Yes! Ellis and Ava! Woof!

310
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:01,895
[Ava and Ellis barking]

311
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:12,781
Perfect! My turn for... zap!

312
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:18,245
Here goes nothing. Fulminis!

313
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,914
[monster shrieking]

314
00:20:26,253 --> 00:20:32,130
Yeah! Yeah! Get zapped!
Oh, get zapped by the zap hand!

315
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:33,715
My zap hand! Yeah!

316
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:35,597
Can you be astounded later?

317
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:40,392
Right! Uh, Rayla, finishing move.
You got this! Slash!

318
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,313
[yelps]

319
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:47,190
- Rayla!
- No!

320
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:52,362
[monster shrieking]

321
00:20:56,366 --> 00:20:58,618
[Rayla panting] That was too close.

322
00:21:00,496 --> 00:21:04,374
If that thing was a split-second faster,
I would have been...

323
00:21:06,418 --> 00:21:10,213
[groaning] Help! Help me!

324
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,507
Aspiro!

325
00:21:17,054 --> 00:21:18,051
[Callum] Yes!

326
00:21:18,138 --> 00:21:20,137
[chuckling] How 'bout that?

327
00:21:20,224 --> 00:21:22,684
I knew "whoosh" should have been
part of the plan.

328
00:21:25,938 --> 00:21:29,482
[footsteps approaching]

329
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:42,701
Enough brooding, elf.
My patience wears thin.

330
00:21:42,788 --> 00:21:48,418
Tell me what you know about this relic
or I will seal your fate.

331
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:54,301
You have succeeded.

332
00:21:54,388 --> 00:21:56,676
Oh, have I?

333
00:21:57,219 --> 00:22:02,017
That mirror? You have found something
worse than death.

334
00:22:02,104 --> 00:22:04,978
Then, tell me. What is it?

335
00:22:05,065 --> 00:22:07,851
I will never help you.

336
00:22:07,938 --> 00:22:11,358
Then you are of no use to me.

337
00:22:15,362 --> 00:22:17,990
[chanting]

338
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,538
[Runaan grunting]

339
00:22:27,457 --> 00:22:30,502
- [whistling]
- [chanting continues]

340
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:33,463
[Runaan screaming]

341
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:38,343
[chanting and screaming continue]

342
00:22:42,347 --> 00:22:43,848
[screaming stops]

343
00:22:51,148 --> 00:22:52,190
[gasps]

344
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,077
I always seem to capture
the same expression.

345
00:23:02,164 --> 00:23:07,914
Defiance, giving way to absolute fear.

346
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:18,133
Look! Up there! That's the tree!

347
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:22,759
Yes, we're almost there!
We can do this, team.

348
00:23:22,846 --> 00:23:24,099
We can make it to the rim!

349
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:26,808
We're going to find the healer
and save the egg.

350
00:23:27,392 --> 00:23:30,270
[Ava whimpers]

351
00:23:30,938 --> 00:23:33,606
- Oh, no.
- [Callum] What is it?

352
00:23:34,232 --> 00:23:38,572
I have really bad news.
I don't know how to tell you.

353
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:39,985
Just say it.

354
00:23:40,072 --> 00:23:44,409
Even if we make it to the rim,
it doesn't matter.

355
00:23:44,826 --> 00:23:46,995
There is no miracle healer.

356
00:23:47,117 --> 00:23:49,866
