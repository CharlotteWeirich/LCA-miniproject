1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,830
Earth.

2
00:00:02,832 --> 00:00:04,331
Fire.

3
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:06,033
Air.

4
00:00:06,035 --> 00:00:08,169
Water.

5
00:00:08,171 --> 00:00:12,256
Only the Avatar can master all four elements

6
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:15,009
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:17,993 --> 00:00:19,978

8
00:00:20,098 --> 00:00:22,349
The air nation is reborn!

9
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:24,602
Thanks to the energy shift
during harmonic convergence,

10
00:00:24,604 --> 00:00:27,354
certain people have acquired
airbending abilities,

11
00:00:27,356 --> 00:00:29,523
including Bumi, Kai, and Opal.

12
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:32,026
But although the new recruits
show a lot of promise,

13
00:00:32,028 --> 00:00:33,444
they still have a lot to learn.

14
00:00:33,446 --> 00:00:35,946
So while Korra remains safe in Zaofu,

15
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:37,698
Tenzin has brought the airbenders

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,317
to the northern air temple
to begin their training.

17
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:44,024
__

18
00:00:46,074 --> 00:00:48,542
His pupils once again
pleaded with their master

19
00:00:48,544 --> 00:00:51,078
to eat something, but he refused,

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,914
just like he had each day the entire summer.

21
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,417
Instead, he simply meditated,

22
00:00:56,419 --> 00:00:59,220
getting his nourishment from the universe.

23
00:00:59,222 --> 00:01:03,090
So Monk Tang Xu completed the 97th day

24
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:04,925
of his historic fast

25
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:07,478
on which island?

26
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,763
Ooh! Ooh, ooh!

27
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:10,765
Anyone besides otaku,

28
00:01:10,767 --> 00:01:13,100
who already studied this
in his acolyte training...

29
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:14,318
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,103
And is answering every question?

31
00:01:16,105 --> 00:01:19,073
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

32
00:01:19,075 --> 00:01:20,324
Whaletail island!

33
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:23,911
That is correct. Again.

34
00:01:23,913 --> 00:01:25,412
Now, on day 98...

35
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:30,417
Greetings, air people.

36
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:32,753
I come seeking boring stories to take

37
00:01:32,755 --> 00:01:34,288
back to the spirit world.

38
00:01:56,862 --> 00:01:58,813
That was incredible!

39
00:01:58,815 --> 00:02:01,532
When do we get to fly around
on our own bison like that?

40
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:03,284
Only after many years of practice

41
00:02:03,286 --> 00:02:04,702
and intense training.

42
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:09,123
Besides, we don't have enough
bison here for all of you.

43
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,992
What about those?
It's a whole herd of bisons.

44
00:02:11,994 --> 00:02:14,461
Actually, the plural of "bison" is "bison."

45
00:02:14,463 --> 00:02:15,663
Whoa!

46
00:02:15,665 --> 00:02:17,832
- Cool!
- Wow, look at that.

47
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:20,835
- Can we ride those?
- No, that's a wild herd.

48
00:02:20,837 --> 00:02:23,671
It would take many years to tame them.

49
00:02:23,673 --> 00:02:25,506
Now let's get back to our lessons.

50
00:02:25,508 --> 00:02:26,841
Dad!

51
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:28,843
We brought you more airbenders!

52
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:35,983
Okay, everyone is dismissed.

53
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:38,736
We'll just pick this up...

54
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:40,688
Tomorrow.

55
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:45,659
How was everything in the city?

56
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:47,695
Well, we had a little scare,

57
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:49,029
but everything is okay.

58
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:51,198
Zaheer infiltrated the air temple.

59
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,033
What? Is everyone all right?

60
00:02:53,035 --> 00:02:54,535
Everyone's fine.

61
00:02:54,537 --> 00:02:56,537
I fought with him, but he got away.

62
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:58,873
And he stole some old necklace
that had something to do

63
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:02,009
with Guru Lak... Schmeer.

64
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:03,344
Guru Laghima.

65
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:05,179
Right.

66
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:07,431
You know,
I can never keep all those gurus straight.

67
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:09,183
There were, like, a million of them.

68
00:03:09,185 --> 00:03:11,218
Remember that long,
boring story about the guy

69
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,519
who never ate?

70
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:14,772
Yes, I remember.

71
00:03:14,774 --> 00:03:17,725
Avatar Korra is calling on the temple radio.

72
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:22,196
Are you all right? Where are you?

73
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:23,731
With Beifong's sister in Zaofu.

74
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:25,783
We're totally safe, unless we get caught

75
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:28,035
in another fight between Su and Lin.

76
00:03:28,037 --> 00:03:29,870
Lin willingly took you to her sister?

77
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:31,238
Not exactly.

78
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,073
We got a call about a new airbender,

79
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:34,909
and it turned out to be Su's daughter, Opal.

80
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:36,744
She'll be headed your way soon.

81
00:03:36,746 --> 00:03:38,245
Really? That's wonderful!

82
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:40,581
She is wonderful

83
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,083
and pretty and so smart!

84
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:46,470
And she smells like flowers.

85
00:03:46,472 --> 00:03:47,755
Sorry.

86
00:03:47,757 --> 00:03:49,473
Bolin out.

87
00:03:49,475 --> 00:03:50,758
How's the training going?

88
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,760
Not so well, I'm afraid.

89
00:03:52,762 --> 00:03:55,062
No one seems to be
interested in the hard work

90
00:03:55,064 --> 00:03:57,815
required to become a part of the air nation.

91
00:03:57,817 --> 00:04:00,100
You need to give yourself a break.

92
00:04:00,102 --> 00:04:02,269
Let Jinora and the kids help you out.

93
00:04:02,271 --> 00:04:04,571
And what about Bumi?
He was a naval commander.

94
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:05,773
Maybe he has some ideas

95
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:07,241
about how to get people motivated.

96
00:04:07,243 --> 00:04:09,610
Bumi? He's my worst student!

97
00:04:09,612 --> 00:04:12,446
Yeah, but he loves to organize people.

98
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:14,448
If you ask him for help, you can trick him

99
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,116
into taking more responsibility

100
00:04:16,118 --> 00:04:18,919
by making him think the
whole thing was his idea.

101
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:20,287
Hmm.

102
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:22,623
That actually sounds like a good plan.

103
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:26,093
You're turning into a pretty
wise Avatar after all.

104
00:04:26,095 --> 00:04:30,097
Conflict resolution. It's what I do.

105
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:31,432
We should go down there.

106
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:33,133
I want to fly one of those bisons.

107
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:35,469
I don't know. We might get in trouble.

108
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:37,271
Come on, let's have some fun.

109
00:04:37,273 --> 00:04:39,690
We'll be back before
anyone realizes we're gone.

110
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:41,642
I guess it will be all right.

111
00:04:55,657 --> 00:04:57,324
Look, baby bisons.

112
00:04:57,326 --> 00:04:59,209
How come they're all on the ground?

113
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:01,128
Air bison calves can't fly for a week or two

114
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,496
after they're born,

115
00:05:02,498 --> 00:05:03,998
so the entire herd will stay near the ground

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,299
in the valley.

117
00:05:05,301 --> 00:05:06,800
Let's go see the babies.

118
00:05:06,802 --> 00:05:09,470
Be careful. The mothers are very protective.

119
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:19,013
Aw, look how cute.

120
00:05:19,015 --> 00:05:21,849
Kai, get out of there!

121
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:35,996
Whoa!

122
00:05:35,998 --> 00:05:37,531
Wow, you really saved me down there.

123
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:39,366
- Oh.
- You know,

124
00:05:39,368 --> 00:05:40,868
you're an incredible airbender.

125
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,203
Well, I've been training for a long time.

126
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:44,538
Then why don't you have tattoos

127
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,040
like an airbending master?

128
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:48,042
My dad says I'm not a master yet.

129
00:05:48,044 --> 00:05:50,177
You can do everything your dad can,

130
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:52,679
plus you have all those spirit-y powers.

131
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:56,383
If anyone's a master, you are.

132
00:05:56,385 --> 00:05:58,685
So we bring the net down

133
00:05:58,687 --> 00:06:01,605
on the head pirate,
and he looks around real sad

134
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:04,441
and says,
"I knew I should have followed my dreams"

135
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:05,943
and become a dentist."

136
00:06:07,363 --> 00:06:09,196
How come you grew up to be so cool,

137
00:06:09,198 --> 00:06:11,865
while Tenzin became such a stick in the mud?

138
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:15,035
Well, I guess "cool"
is just something you're born with.

139
00:06:15,037 --> 00:06:19,039
Bumi, can I talk to you?

140
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,542
Let me guess...
you want to criticize me for something.

141
00:06:21,544 --> 00:06:22,960
Actually, I need your help.

142
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:25,295
Oh, yeah? With what?

143
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:26,580
I don't think I'm doing very well

144
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:28,082
with the new airbenders,

145
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:30,918
and everyone knows you're a natural leader.

146
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,387
True, I did win the Admiral Tung

147
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:37,558
natural leadership award twice.

148
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,427
What would you do if you were in charge?

149
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:42,596
Help me be more like you.

150
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:45,065
I'd love to.

151
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:46,650
You've gotta use military discipline

152
00:06:46,652 --> 00:06:48,602
to whip these troops into shape.

153
00:06:48,604 --> 00:06:50,320
The only way to deal with new recruits

154
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:53,907
is to break them down,
so you can build them back up.

155
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:56,276
Rule with an iron fist.

156
00:06:56,278 --> 00:06:58,779
Show them who the master is.

157
00:06:58,781 --> 00:07:01,865
- Thanks for the insight.
- My pleasure.

158
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:12,593
Dawn patrol! Everyone up!

159
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:14,595
Ugh. What are you doing?

160
00:07:14,597 --> 00:07:16,346
It's barely light out.

161
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:18,098
I'm taking your advice.

162
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,434
I'm going to break you
down and build you back up.

163
00:07:20,436 --> 00:07:22,136
Now get moving, recruit!

164
00:07:38,777 --> 00:07:41,945
Nothing like a 10-mile hike
first thing in the morning.

165
00:07:41,947 --> 00:07:44,831
Don't these robes come in a warm,
bison fur version?

166
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:48,117
No, of course not!

167
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,452
Oh!

168
00:07:49,454 --> 00:07:50,954
If it weren't so cold,

169
00:07:50,956 --> 00:07:52,789
I'd go right back to sleep.

170
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,124
Then this is the perfect
time to learn meditation

171
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:57,844
and proper breathing technique.

172
00:07:57,846 --> 00:07:59,629
Airbenders are able to warm themselves

173
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:01,347
with only their breathing.

174
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:03,850
Everyone get into the lotus position.

175
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:06,519
Ah, this is so much more
refreshing than sleeping.

176
00:08:06,521 --> 00:08:09,439
You know,
when I said that thing about an iron fist...

177
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:12,809
hush. Meditation time.

178
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:14,727
Focus.

179
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:30,877
Can we go back to bed now?

180
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,328
Now that we're refreshed and loose

181
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,796
from our hike and meditation,

182
00:08:33,798 --> 00:08:35,832
it's time for a balancing exercise.

183
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:41,721
The key is to maintain your
heaven and earth connection.

184
00:08:44,842 --> 00:08:46,342
Now you try.

185
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:48,728
Back on the posts!

186
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,513
It's not hard if you concentrate!

187
00:08:51,516 --> 00:08:53,149
- Whoa.
- Ugh.

188
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:54,567
Whoa!

189
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:58,187
Get back up!

190
00:08:58,189 --> 00:09:00,406
What's the matter?
You can't handle it, soldier?

191
00:09:06,698 --> 00:09:09,082
Don't you think you're
being a little hard on them?

192
00:09:09,084 --> 00:09:11,534
Don't worry. They can take it.

193
00:09:11,536 --> 00:09:13,670
You'll see.

194
00:09:13,672 --> 00:09:15,922
Ignore the lemurs digging in your ears.

195
00:09:15,924 --> 00:09:17,423
Concentrate on your breathing,

196
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:19,042
and you won't even know they're there.

197
00:09:19,044 --> 00:09:22,045
Whoa, uh, ugh, oh!

198
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:27,050
When the head is shaved,
an airbender is able

199
00:09:27,052 --> 00:09:28,718
to feel the wind around him.

200
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,772
It is both humbling and freeing.

201
00:09:32,774 --> 00:09:34,724
Hey, you wanna sneak away

202
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:36,526
and go check on the baby bisons?

203
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:39,562
Shh. You should be paying attention.

204
00:09:43,902 --> 00:09:45,401
All right, who's next?

205
00:09:45,403 --> 00:09:47,537
I'm not sure I want to shave my head.

206
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:48,905
That's fine.

207
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:50,623
Shaving your head is a personal choice.

208
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:54,077
- Wait, what?
- Anyone else?

209
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:56,379
Fine, then we can get right to
our next training exercise...

210
00:09:56,381 --> 00:09:57,630
obstacle course!

211
00:10:02,386 --> 00:10:04,087
You're pushing too hard.

212
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:05,471
Maybe we should give them a break.

213
00:10:05,473 --> 00:10:09,425
Jinora, I have this under control.

214
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,101
Concentrate.

215
00:10:18,103 --> 00:10:22,772
Remember, airbenders move like the wind.

216
00:10:22,774 --> 00:10:24,774
Agh!

217
00:10:28,663 --> 00:10:29,946
Ugh!

218
00:10:34,619 --> 00:10:36,452
Stay light on your feet,
and you'll never feel

219
00:10:36,454 --> 00:10:41,174
the stinging rash-cactus.

220
00:10:41,176 --> 00:10:43,176
Ow!

221
00:10:54,304 --> 00:10:56,439
Everyone is waiting for you, Bumi.

222
00:10:56,441 --> 00:10:58,307
If you don't make it over
in the next 30 seconds,

223
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:00,443
they'll all have to run
through the course again.

224
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:02,645
- You can do it, Bumi!
- Come on!

225
00:11:05,984 --> 00:11:07,316
Agh!

226
00:11:13,323 --> 00:11:15,124
Get back on that wall, recruit!

227
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:16,826
You're letting your fellow airbenders down.

228
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:19,662
I'm finished!

229
00:11:19,664 --> 00:11:21,464
I never wanted to be an airbender,

230
00:11:21,466 --> 00:11:23,833
and I'm too old to be back in boot camp!

231
00:11:23,835 --> 00:11:25,835
Count me out.

232
00:11:25,837 --> 00:11:27,553
Fine, quit!

233
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:29,839
We don't need your attitude
in the new air nation.

234
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:31,507
Master Tenzin?

235
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:34,177
When do we get to go home
and visit our families?

236
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:36,479
Go home? You just got here.

237
00:11:36,481 --> 00:11:38,481
When's dinner? I'm starving.

238
00:11:38,483 --> 00:11:40,149
Can I change out of my robe now?

239
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:41,901
It's itchy.

240
00:11:41,903 --> 00:11:44,320
This is just as bad as
the earth queen's prison.

241
00:11:44,322 --> 00:11:46,322
I'm tired of all this complaining.

242
00:11:46,324 --> 00:11:47,690
Jinora, take over.

243
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:50,193
Does this mean I'm the master now?

244
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:52,862
Yes. Just lead them through
some basic exercises.

245
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:55,031
Well, since I'm a master,

246
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:56,866
when do you think I can get my tattoos?

247
00:11:56,868 --> 00:11:59,202
- What brought this on?
- I was just talking to Kai,

248
00:11:59,204 --> 00:12:01,003
and he was asking me, so...

249
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:02,872
Kai! What does he know about when

250
00:12:02,874 --> 00:12:04,424
you should get tattoos?

251
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:06,342
The answer is no! You're just a little girl.

252
00:12:06,344 --> 00:12:08,211
I'm not a little girl anymore!

253
00:12:08,213 --> 00:12:10,213
I can airbend just as well as you.

254
00:12:10,215 --> 00:12:12,682
I know everything about
our culture and history,

255
00:12:12,684 --> 00:12:14,517
and I have a stronger
connection with the spirits

256
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,852
than you ever will.

257
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:19,722
Lead your own class!

258
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:21,524
Ikki, Meelo, you're up.

259
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:24,444
Just lead them through the Bagua circle.

260
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,899
Look to your left! Look to your right!

261
00:12:29,901 --> 00:12:33,703
One of those people will not
make it out of here alive.

262
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:39,575
Sorry if what I said got you in trouble

263
00:12:39,577 --> 00:12:40,910
with your dad.

264
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:42,912
It's not your fault.

265
00:12:42,914 --> 00:12:45,047
He just can't believe that I'm grown up now

266
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:46,883
and I don't need him telling me what to do

267
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:49,752
like one of his recruits.

268
00:12:49,754 --> 00:12:52,338
I know something that'll cheer you up.

269
00:12:57,594 --> 00:13:00,229
Where did all the spirits go?

270
00:13:00,231 --> 00:13:01,814
Where are the babies?

271
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:04,934
Aah!

272
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:18,164
What are these kids doing in my camp?

273
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,082
We caught them sneaking around.

274
00:13:20,084 --> 00:13:22,668
We thought they might
tell someone we're here.

275
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,254
They're those new airbenders.

276
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:28,457
Must be living up at the temple.

277
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:30,176
Hurry up and gather the rest of the gang,

278
00:13:30,178 --> 00:13:31,677
and let's get out of here

279
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:34,430
before someone comes looking for these kids.

280
00:13:34,432 --> 00:13:36,465
We'll take them to Ba Sing Se

281
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:39,852
with the rest of the fresh meat.

282
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:45,736
Tattoos. How can she think...

283
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:47,138
Focus.

284
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,106
Breathe.

285
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:51,609
Bumi ruins everything.

286
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:53,444
Inhale.

287
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:55,646
Focus.

288
00:13:55,648 --> 00:13:58,015
Taking a little break from teaching?

289
00:13:58,017 --> 00:13:59,750
I failed.

290
00:13:59,752 --> 00:14:01,652
Bumi quit, and the rest of the airbenders

291
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:03,120
want to go home.

292
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:04,422
Can't they see that I'm trying

293
00:14:04,424 --> 00:14:06,324
to rebuild an entire culture?

294
00:14:06,326 --> 00:14:08,459
You know,
just because these people can airbend,

295
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:11,495
it doesn't automatically
make them air nomads.

296
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:13,631
Tell me about it.

297
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:15,499
I remember when I moved out of my parents'
house

298
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:17,201
to become an air acolyte.

299
00:14:17,203 --> 00:14:19,503
That first night,
I was so scared and lonely,

300
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:21,772
and the bed was so hard.

301
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:24,508
It's actually better for your back.

302
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,510
Sorry.

303
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:27,111
The point is,

304
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:28,779
I really wanted to be there,

305
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:30,448
but it still took time for me to adjust

306
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,216
and feel like I was a part of it all.

307
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:34,619
These people are probably
feeling the same way.

308
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:37,788
You have to be patient.

309
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,725
Now I know how Korra feels
when I'm talking to her.

310
00:14:42,995 --> 00:14:45,796
Thank you, Pema.

311
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:55,706
Bumi,
I want to apologize for losing my patience.

312
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,842
I'm not talking to you.

313
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:03,147
Hey, get back here!

314
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,917
Where's Jinora?

315
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,418
I saw her fly off on her glider

316
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,686
with her boyfriend.

317
00:15:08,688 --> 00:15:10,821
What? Her boyfriend?

318
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:13,190
Kai.

319
00:15:16,578 --> 00:15:18,829
How can you steal these bison?

320
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:20,498
They're endangered.

321
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,667
That's why they're worth so much.

322
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:24,335
The earth queen and her fancy friends

323
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:27,922
pay big money for bison
steaks and other weird meat.

324
00:15:27,924 --> 00:15:30,925
I even heard she ate her dad's pet bear.

325
00:15:30,927 --> 00:15:34,045
You're disgusting.

326
00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:39,183
Hey, do that spirit beaming
thing you did to find me.

327
00:15:39,185 --> 00:15:40,601
Go to the temple for help.

328
00:15:40,603 --> 00:15:42,386
I can't. I'm all cramped in here,

329
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:45,439
and I need quiet and time to focus.

330
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:48,059
But maybe I can send a message.

331
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:54,732
Spirits, I need your help.

332
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,121
Go find Bum-Ju. Tell him we're in trouble.

333
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:03,457
No, I don't think

334
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:05,409
I should apologize.

335
00:16:05,411 --> 00:16:07,962
Tenzin just wants to boss everybody around.

336
00:16:07,964 --> 00:16:09,630
I'm too old for that.

337
00:16:11,968 --> 00:16:13,467
Well, let's face it.

338
00:16:13,469 --> 00:16:16,554
I'm just not cut out to be an airbender.

339
00:16:17,757 --> 00:16:20,091
Well, that's your opinion.

340
00:16:31,904 --> 00:16:34,939
Wait, did Jinora send this spirit?

341
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:36,774
Is she in trouble?

342
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:44,782
Jinora's in trouble!

343
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:46,083
We have to go get her.

344
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:47,284
How do you know?

345
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:48,919
Bum-Ju's friend told me.

346
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:51,172
You are able to communicate
with the spirits?

347
00:16:51,174 --> 00:16:53,124
More or less. I get the gist. Let's go!

348
00:16:53,126 --> 00:16:55,426
Shouldn't master Tenzin
be dealing with this?

349
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:57,128
I don't want to get into trouble.

350
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,131
Master Tenzin isn't here. It's up to us.

351
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:02,133
Ikki and Meelo, grab some bison.

352
00:17:02,135 --> 00:17:05,136
Airbenders, move out!

353
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:18,149
Bison rustlers.

354
00:17:18,151 --> 00:17:20,618
They've got Kai and Jinora locked in crates.

355
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,869
Looks like they're getting ready to leave.

356
00:17:21,871 --> 00:17:23,654
We'll have to move fast.

357
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:24,989
I don't know if I'm ready to get in a fight

358
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,791
with some bison rustlers.

359
00:17:26,793 --> 00:17:28,325
I can tell without the telescope

360
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:30,044
that they're mean-looking.

361
00:17:30,046 --> 00:17:32,830
Listen,
this is what we've been training for.

362
00:17:32,832 --> 00:17:34,131
We haven't been training that long.

363
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:36,500
That's not important now.

364
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:39,386
Remember how we persevered
together on the obstacle course?

365
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:41,972
You actually quit.

366
00:17:41,974 --> 00:17:44,341
Well, I'm not quitting now.

367
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:47,228
I know we've had a tough time...
me more than anyone...

368
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,014
but we're airbenders,
and there aren't many of us,

369
00:17:50,016 --> 00:17:52,483
so we've got to stick together.

370
00:17:52,485 --> 00:17:54,518
They've got two of our
own in cages out there,

371
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,022
and we're not leaving
until we bring them home.

372
00:17:58,024 --> 00:18:00,691
Leave no airbender behind!

373
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,584
In, down, and...

374
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:12,169
Twist.

375
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:18,209
Free the bison first.

376
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:20,044
Hey, what are you doing out?

377
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:34,391
Oof! Ugh!

378
00:19:03,089 --> 00:19:06,090
Ooh!

379
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:11,979
Kai!

380
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:27,278
What's going on down there?

381
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,946
Kai, help!

382
00:19:28,948 --> 00:19:31,615
I'm coming, Jinora.

383
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:52,603
What the...

384
00:20:10,655 --> 00:20:12,289
You got me.

385
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,208
I give up.

386
00:20:17,797 --> 00:20:19,213
You think you can kidnap Jinora

387
00:20:19,215 --> 00:20:22,833
and all these baby bisons?

388
00:20:25,221 --> 00:20:27,638
Kai! That's enough.

389
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,841
An airbender never attacks
a defenseless opponent.

390
00:20:32,644 --> 00:20:35,346
But that was very good technique.

391
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:44,154
Maybe you boys haven't heard,

392
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:47,191
but there's some new
airbenders around these parts.

393
00:20:47,193 --> 00:20:51,078
And you never mess with
an airbender's bison.

394
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,031
Without my shaved head,

395
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:55,366
I never could have dodged that net.

396
00:20:55,368 --> 00:20:57,501
I really felt it coming at me.

397
00:20:57,503 --> 00:20:59,586
You guys should totally get shaved.

398
00:20:59,588 --> 00:21:01,538
I'm proud of you.

399
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,591
Your connection with the spirits
and natural leadership...

400
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:06,377
you remind me of dad.

401
00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:09,930
I'm sorry I've been causing
you so much trouble.

402
00:21:09,932 --> 00:21:11,715
I guess I was just scared of not being able

403
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:14,184
to measure up as an airbender.

404
00:21:14,186 --> 00:21:16,186
You know, even though I'm Aang's son,

405
00:21:16,188 --> 00:21:20,524
I never really felt like I was
part of the air nation before.

406
00:21:20,526 --> 00:21:23,861
You are now.

407
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,233
They're so friendly now.

408
00:21:29,235 --> 00:21:31,568
The bison are the original airbenders.

409
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:36,240
They recognize their own kind.

410
00:21:36,242 --> 00:21:38,243
I'm sorry for running off.

411
00:21:38,262 --> 00:21:40,114
We're just lucky no one
was hurt.

412
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:42,485
- I know.
- Well, I also realize,

413
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:44,757
that I was too harsh with you.

414
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:47,253
Does that mean I can get my airbender
tattoos?

415
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:50,081
It's hard for me to believe that my
little girl has grown up

416
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,683
enough to have her tattoos.

417
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,244
But I promise I'll think about it.

418
00:21:54,656 --> 00:21:56,283
- Fair enough?
- Yeah.

419
00:21:56,403 --> 00:21:58,379
Jinora, look! They're flying!

420
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,215
I guess everyone is growing up.

421
