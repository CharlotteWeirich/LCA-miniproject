00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,300
Hey, Fry!

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,710
Pizza going out!
Come on!

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,050
Aw, all right.
I'll take the Red Rocket.

10
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,830
Hello! Pizza delivery for...

11
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,500
D. Frosted Wang?

12
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,670
Ugh, not another crank delivery!

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,500
Why don't I read these
ahead of time?

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,340
One time was funny.

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,640
But every week for ten years?
Not as funny.

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,980
True, not as funny.
But still somewhat funny.

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,720
And-and then
they burst out laughing

18
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,950
a second time.

19
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,960
I've been a delivery boy
for a thousand years.

20
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,430
Isn't there any room for
promotion around here?

21
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,030
There'll be no promotions
unless somebody dies.

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,500
And even then, only if we can't

23
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,300
bring them back as
a zombie, like Scruffy.

24
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,900
Life and death are
a seamless continuum.

25
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,470
Mm-hmm.

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,840
Well, could I at least
get some encouragement?

27
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,570
I could use a shot in the arm.

28
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,040
I get shot in the leg!

29
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,350
Roberto!
What are you doing here?

30
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,720
What? A fella can't drop in
on old friends

31
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,590
and hold them hostage?

32
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,450
I'm good. And you?

00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,460
Attention, criminal robot

34
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,060
Come out with your hands up!

35
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,730
- Never!
- Uh... other guy.

36
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,600
Listen up, piggies,
I want a hovercopter,

37
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,400
and an unmarked sandwich,

38
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,670

a, a Hugh Grant look.

Nah, I specifically said
hovercopter!

45
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,820
One chopper, coming up.

46
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,780
Hi-yah!
Ah!

49
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,960
sometimes it's almost
too much for me.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,630
You mean the respect we get?

51
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,570
And the high level
of job satisfaction?

52
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,300
There's that, but I'm
also talking about

53

the non-stop promotions
and the free hot rod.

Ahem!

56
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,010
I mean a uniform that
doesn't involve short pants.

57
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,450
I can see I have
no future here.

58
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,320
My only option is
to resign with dignity.

00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,740
you'll be riding with URL.

103
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,210
And Smitty was just
a few days from retirement.

104
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,570
Wh-What happened?

105
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,610
He took a early
retirement. Damn.

106
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,350
Let's get down to business.

107
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,420
Aren't you going to say,
"Good news, everyone"?

108
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,290
Oh, I just said that
for Fry's benefit.

109
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,690
Made the poor fellow feel better
about his pointless job.

110
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,360
As much as I miss him,

111
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,360
he didn't really serve
much purpose around here.

112
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,900
Though he did walk Zoidberg.

113
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,570
In any case,
I've improved on Fry

114
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,870
by sticking some wheels on
a board, so Leela and Bender

115
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,940
can easily make the next
delivery without him.

116
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,680
Me? So where we going?

117
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,710
Pandora.

118
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,550
That dangerous 3D planet?

119
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,310
Can't we just send our avatars?

120
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,250
No, it's cheaper
just to have you die.

121
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,300
Whoa. 15 miles over
the speed of light.

122
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,770
That's a violation of the law
of Lorentz's invariants, baby.

123
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,170
Light 'em up.

124
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,960
Look out for that
particular individual!

125
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,700
An electric wall, eh?

126
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,630
I can't see the harm
in peeing on that.

Sunny D commercial.

129
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,760

What's in the box, Schrodinger?

133
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,420
Um... a cat, some poison,
and a cesium atom.

134
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,220
is it
alive or dead?

<i>Alive or dead?</i>

136
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,920
Answer him, fool.

137
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,590
It's a superposition
of both states

138
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,860
until you open it and
collapse the wave function.

139
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,600
Says you.

140
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,470
There's also
a lot of drugs in there.

141
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,920

150
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,920
Oops.

151
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,790
I can't make out a thing.

152
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,500
Well, I guess you should
have had two eyes.

153
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,260
Just deliver the package,
and let's get out of here.

154
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,870
Screw that! I ain't
no delivery boy.

155
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,500
I'm the company chef.

156
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,870
Oh, you're the chef, are you?

157
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,470
Then why don't you make us
something nice to eat?

158
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,580
Here's your damn peanut butter
and jelly sandwich!

159
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,430
Now that we can predict
crimes with 99% accuracy,

160
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,760
we can arrest most perpetrators

161
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,600
before they even
perpetrate anything.

162
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,830
That's ridiculous.

163
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,930
Only horoscopes
can predict the future.

164
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,500
That's what we used to think.

165
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,870
Until we invented... this.

166
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,780
Ooh.

167
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,350
Slow down, baby.

168
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,920
The Cybernetic Oracle.

169
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,980
The ultimate man-machine hybrid.

170
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,390
Programmed with
every crime ever recorded,

171
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,850
and implanted
with the brain cells

172
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,660
of history's
greatest detectives.

173
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,690
We call him...
Pickles.

174
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,230
On account of it's like
he's floating in a jar?

175
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,800
Exactly.

176
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,730
The Oracle's visions are
recorded on these colored balls.

177
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,400
Green is larceny.
Black is fraud.

178
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,470
homicide.

179
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,870
What's pink polka-dots?
Clown slaughter.

180
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,870
It happens more often
than you'd think.

181
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,840
Floater in the bowl!

182
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,840
Red ball. Homicide!

183
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,310
Whoo!

184
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,650
male, six foot one.

185
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,620
Distinctive mustard stain
on his forehead.

186
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,350
My kajigger!

187
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,760
Hattie McDoogal.

188
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,300
Look, the clock says 5:08.

189
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,970
It's 4:30 right now.

190
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,470
Uh-oh, we only have
a half hour to chill out

191
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,570
before we head over.

192
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,640
Oh, Hattie.

193
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,840
When I look into
your one good eye,

194
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,650
I see a reflection of beauty.

195
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,820
Oh! Fresh.

196
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,520
Freeze, fool.

197
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,220
You're under arrest
for future murder!

198
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,420
Yeah? You can't arrest
me for future murder...

199
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,360
after it's right now murder!

200
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,630
My kajigger!

201
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,900
So he didn't really
want to marry me?

202
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,370
Nah. See, he knew
you left everything

203
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,410
to your parakeets in your will.

204
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,280
He was going to murder you,
marry your parakeets,

205
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,980
and then poison them with
an arsenic-laced cuttlebone.

206
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,680
Classic move.

207
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,520
Aw, yeah.

208
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,250
Congratulations
on your big bust.

209
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,690
You, too.

210
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,720
Keep it up, and you boys
might just make detective.

211
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,260
Now, if you'll excuse me,

212
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,930
I got to go drop a big one.

213
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,560
Wow. I can't
believe it.

214
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,500
One more promotion,
and I'll be a real detective,

215
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,740
like Sherlock Holmes
or Speed Buggy.

216
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,340
Eight pounds.

217
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,540
I'm naming her Burt.

218
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,940
Mazel tov, Chief.

219
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,380
That's a beautiful
bathroom baby.

220
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,810
Hey, you heading home, Phil?

221
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,320
In a minute.

222
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,680
I just want to finish
this paperless work.

223
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,390
Don't stay up too late.

224
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,960
We got a lot of people
to shoot tomorrow.

225
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,730
Hello! Anyone?

226
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,030
There's never a cop
around when you need one.

227
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,000
Green ball. Larceny.

228
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,710
<i>Hmm.</i>

229
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,280
<i>The thief seems to be</i>
<i>some sort of ghost.</i>

230
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,290
<i>Or is he?</i>

231
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,690
Aah! Bender?

232
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,370
Our
corporate tax rate

233
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,800
remained unchanged
this fiscal year.

234
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,170
That's not funny.

235
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,410
It's not supposed to be funny.

236
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,810
It's a business meeting.

237
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,940
Things used to be funny
around here.

238
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,380
Noses were picked,
pants fell down.

239
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,910
So what changed?

240
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,120
Only Fry could say,
and he's gone.

241
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,650
Hey.

242
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,950
Bender and Leela are back
from Pandora.

243
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,350
How was it?

244
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,820
Awful.

245
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,720
We had nothing to
say to each other,

246
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,330
so we had to listen to Bender's
Eagles album for 27 hours.

247
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,730
Beats talking to you,
witchy woman.

248
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,730
Hey, he's back!

249
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,300
Look at you.
Hubba hubba.

250
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,030
Your pants go almost all the way
to your ankles.

251
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,740
Good afternoon, individuals.

252
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,670
Sir, would you mind
stepping out of the building?

253
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,440
Normally, when a cop
asks me that,

254
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,180
I spray whip cream
in his eyes and run away,

255
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,710
but to ditch
these losers, gladly.

256
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,850
Bender, be honest with me.

257
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,380
Are you planning a big heist?

258
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,250
Usually, but not at the moment.

259
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,190
I only ask
'cause the Oracle thinks

260
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,430
you're going to pull off
a major theft next Thursday.

261
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,930
Next Thursday, you say?

262
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,760
Pray, continue.

263
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,970
Are you familiar with
this particular location?

264
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,670
I may have a burgling
familiarity with it.

265
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,670
Does the word "Maltese"
mean anything to you?

266
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,770
The Maltese Liquor--
the strongest,

267
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,340
the most valuable malt liquor
ever brewed!

268
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,050
And soon it will be mine.

269
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,080
I'm sorry.
You were saying?

270
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,680
Bender, I'm only
telling you this

271
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,420
so you can avoid
committing the crime.

272
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,760
"Avoid committing
the crime." Got it.

273
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,890
You wrote "commit the crime"!

274
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:30,000
Oh, there's got to be some way
to stop Bender.

275
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,700
Maybe something
in the Oracle's predictions

276
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,970
that I missed before
due to incompetence.

277
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,740
Wait.
Who's the trigger-happy jerk?

278
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,150
That's me!

279
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,720
I recognize the face.

280
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,990
You shot me!

281
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,160
You miserable dingus!

282
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,090
No! No!
What have I will have done?

283
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,800
Man, that's heavy.
Osmium heavy.

284
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,800
Wha...? Are you going to turn me
in for concealing evidence?

285
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,000
Say what?

286
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,200
You're my partner, home Fry.

287
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,870
Besides, I got my own secrets.

288
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,410
Anything big worth checking out?

289
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,040
Just your big
jangly booty, baby.

290
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,310
See you tonight, toots.

291
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,780
You... and the chief?

292
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,780
Mm-hmm. We been gettin' it on.

293
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
Right there in your chair.

294
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,790
I'm like, "Oh,
baby! Oh, baby!"

295
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,460
And she's like,
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."

296
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,370
I would never shoot Bender.
Never!

297
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,300
He taught me how to shave.

298
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,070
Revision ball.

299
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,070
By deciding not
to shoot Bender,

300
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,280
you created an
alternate future.

301
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,010
I could never
shoot you. Never!

302
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,380
You taught me how to shave.

303
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,810
See?

304
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,350
Just get out of here.

305
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,990
Go!

306
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,860
Now, dig the unintended
consequences.

307
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,330
My friends, let us
share this booze

308
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,390
in a toast to our
dear friend, Bender.

309
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,970
Oops.

310
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,740
The Maltese Liquor
done destroyed their brains.

311
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,770
Fools should have
known it's fatal

312
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,840
for anyone but robots
and Billy Dee Williams.

313
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,020
So, if I don't shoot Bender,
all my other friends will die?

314
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,820
Fate is a freaky mistress.

315
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,280
Much like the chief.

316
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,690
Look out!

317
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,990
Something's not right.

318
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,320
I refuse to believe it.

319
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,020
Rewind.

320
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,100
Ooh.

321
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,270
Are you the calloused
working man I ordered?

322
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,110
Uh, sure.

323
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,780
In order to fix
your leaky roof,

324
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,480
I'll need to spend
two or three hours

325
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,040
down here in the wine cellar.

326
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,150
I'll be upstairs
putting batteries in things.

327
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,150
Whoa!

328
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,050
The Maltese Liquor.

329
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,020
40 ounces of heaven!

330
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,430
Here, boy.

331
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,230
This is for you.

332
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,930
Ah.

333
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,900
Hmm.

334
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,980
Invisible safe, eh?

335
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,380
Aah!

336
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,380
Ah, yeah, baby!

337
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,450
210 proof.

338
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,720
That's all
the proof I need.

339
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,060
Put the bottle back.

340
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,690
We both know I won't do that.

341
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,190
Either you're going
to shoot me,

342
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,230
or I'm going to spray
whip cream in your eyes

343
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,100
and walk out of here
like a big shot.

344
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,160
Bender, no!
You don't have to do something

345
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,770
just 'cause it's going
to happen.

346
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,140
The future's making a chump
out of you.

347
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,210
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm going to
make a chump out of the future.

348
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,070
I'm not stealing anything!

349
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,840
Yes! I stopped the crime
without shooting you.

350
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,380
The Oracle was wrong.

351
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,450
Was I?

352
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,650
Pickles?
Yes.

353
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,950
It is I, Pickles.

354
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,650
I set the whole thing up.

355
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,390
Everyone will think
Bender's the thief

356
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,360
while I make off
with that glorious brew.

357
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,190
Seriously? Why?

358
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,960
So I can kill
my human brain cells.

359
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,100
Do you have any idea
what a burden it is

360
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,430
to know everything
that will ever happen?

361
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,170
To never be surprised.

362
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,100
To know the punch line
of every joke hours in advance.

363
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,270
Like watching Leno.

364
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,110
And that is why I faked

365
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,080
the prediction of this crime.

366
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,180
Nevertheless--
stay with me here--

367
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,050
things will now happen
just as I fake predicted.

368
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,420
Bender, you're going
to hand me that bottle.

369
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,090
Not that one!

370
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,860
The real one,
which you switched

371
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,790
when Fry stupidly looked away.

372
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,890
Hey.

373
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,100
Ah, man.

374
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,430
Why you got to be
so Oracle-y?

375
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,300
Fry, you are going
to shoot Bender,

376
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,700
killing him and shattering
the fake bottle,

377
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,240
just as I predicted.

378
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,670
Do it!

379
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,940
It is your destiny!

380
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,180
Funny thing about destiny.

381
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,380
Sometimes fate has other plans.

382
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,880
Oh, nuts.

383
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,090
You shot me!

384
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,160
You miserable dingus!

385
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:22,360
And now the part
I didn't show you.

386
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,660
Everyone will think
Bender killed you,

387
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,400
and I walk away
with the goofy juice!

388
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,810
Finally, blissful ignorance.

389
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,410
I have no idea
what's going to happen next.

390
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,450
Did you get that, Chief?
Huh?

391
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,680
We got it all from behind
this prediction-proof glass.

392
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,150
But how could you know
my prediction was fake?

393
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,360
I knew something was wrong,

394
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,160
but I couldn't put
my finger on it.

395
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,160
Then it hit me.

396
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,790
You showed Bender

397
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,700
sharing the deadly booze
with our friends.

398
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,030
Bender would never share.

399
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,370
The very idea!

400
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,900
So we set up
this little charade

401
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,970
based on an episode
of <i>Speed Buggy.</i>

402
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,310
With the added benefit
of me and the chief

403
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,910
being locked in a small room.

404
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,450
Shall we adjourn
to the dungeon?

405
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,860
Well, I got my shield
for stopping Bender.

406
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,360
But then I got fired
for tipping off Bender.

407
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,730
Fry, we have no idea
what you do around here,

408
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,870
but we desperately
need you back.

409
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,810
Really? Um, I don't suppose
there's any chance

410
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,440
I could get a promotion.

411
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,840
Sure. What the heck?

412
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:50,430
I hear by promotion,
executive delivery boy.

413
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,730
Executive?

414
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,420
It's a meaning less title.

415
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,370
But it helps insecure people
feel better about themselves.

416
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,820
I feel better about myself!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
