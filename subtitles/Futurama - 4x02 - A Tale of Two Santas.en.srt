00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:09,403  X1:231 X2:485 Y1:061 Y2:082
Tale of Two Santas

2
00:00:32,413 --> 00:00:36,531  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:061 Y2:121
<i>In true winter tradition, members</i>
<i>of the Zarlon 7 Polar Bear Club...</i>

3
00:00:36,693 --> 00:00:40,527  X1:162 X2:551 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>... today took the plunge</i>
<i>into a river of liquid ammonia.</i>

4
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:48,168  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:061 Y2:121
<i>- There were no survivors.</i>
<i>- It takes all kinds.</i>

5
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:53,202  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>Now, with his annual message, here's</i>
<i>the head of the Xmas Safety Council:</i>

6
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:57,844  X1:164 X2:549 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>- The head of Walter Cronkite.</i>
<i>- Season 's warnings.</i>

7
00:00:58,013 --> 00:01:00,732  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:061 Y2:127
This guy's too trustworthy.
What's his angle?

8
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:04,568  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>In all the tinsel and terror</i>
<i>of the holiday season...</i>

9
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:10,205  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:061 Y2:121
<i>... we underestimate that murderous</i>
<i>brute known as Santa Claus.</i>

10
00:01:10,373 --> 00:01:15,811  X1:108 X2:615 Y1:061 Y2:121
<i>With images of last year's Gingerbread</i>
<i>Massacre baked into our memories...</i>

11
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:20,205  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>... I remind you to bolt your doors,</i>
<i>say goodbye to your pets...</i>

12
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:22,807  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:061 Y2:121
<i>... and lock your children</i>
<i>in the closet.</i>

13
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:26,761  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>This is Walter Cronkite saying,</i>
<i>"I told you so."</i>

14
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:34,929  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:456 Y2:516
Sacred boar of Western Samoa!
We must secure for Santa's arrival!

15
00:01:35,693 --> 00:01:38,526  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:061 Y2:122
Fine. I'm getting tired
of this wood show.

16
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:42,366  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:490 Y2:516
Cover that fireplace!

17
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:46,685  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:516
I've only a few years to live.
I don't want to spend them dead.

18
00:01:46,853 --> 00:01:51,210  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:450 Y2:516
- We're pushing as hard as we can.
- Oh! Pushing.

19
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:56,285  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:450 Y2:516
We're doomed.
Every year we're doomed.

20
00:01:56,493 --> 00:02:00,327  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:451 Y2:516
Thanks be I had these
bulletproof shutters installed.

21
00:02:09,413 --> 00:02:13,804  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:451 Y2:516
Bring it on, Santa. That vicious
cadaver-junkie can't touch us...

22
00:02:13,973 --> 00:02:18,125  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:450 Y2:516
...as long as we're not stupid enough
to leave this building.

23
00:02:18,893 --> 00:02:22,772  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:061 Y2:126
In a related matter,
you'll deliver this sack of letters...

24
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:26,403  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:061 Y2:126
...directly to Santa
at his death fortress on Neptune.

25
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:42,525  X1:134 X2:580 Y1:061 Y2:121
These letters are real butt-nutters.
Listen to this. "Dear Santa..."

26
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:45,651  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Please, please don 't bring me</i>
<i>any gifts.</i>

27
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:50,523  X1:105 X2:609 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>The bicycle you fired at me last year</i>
<i>from your bike gun tore up my insides.</i>

28
00:02:50,693 --> 00:02:54,003  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:455 Y2:516
Awful! Let's read some more.
"Dear Santa..."

29
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,607  X1:113 X2:599 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>Please bring me a coffin for Grandpa.</i>

30
00:02:56,773 --> 00:03:02,882  X1:122 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>You choked him with a chestnut last</i>
<i>year, and he's beginning to smell.</i>

31
00:03:05,013 --> 00:03:09,689  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:451 Y2:516
In my day, Xmas was supposed to bring
people together, not blow them apart.

32
00:03:09,853 --> 00:03:13,926  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:453 Y2:516
Sure, but who's gonna do anything
about it? Not us. No, sir.

33
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:19,008  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:455 Y2:516
Yes, us. We've got to bring back
the kind of Xmas I remember.

34
00:03:19,173 --> 00:03:23,371  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:516
Fry's right. It's time
to sit on Santa's lap, and hard!

35
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:40,728  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:490 Y2:516
Look, a cute little welcoming party.

36
00:03:42,693 --> 00:03:46,925  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Want to buy a tiny kidney?
- I'll let you punch me for a buck.

37
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,324  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:450 Y2:516
Look, we've got mail for Santa.
Are you his elves?

38
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:54,287  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:450 Y2:516
- No, we're Neptunians.
- We're tiny because he won't feed us.

39
00:03:55,253 --> 00:03:57,369  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:495 Y2:516
You hit me. You owe me a dollar.

40
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:08,885  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:451 Y2:516
Got any food? Old tea bags,
chewed gum, apple cores?

41
00:04:09,053 --> 00:04:12,329  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:450 Y2:516
- We're starving here!
- You live in a gingerbread house.

42
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:18,045  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:516
- It's food or shelter, not both.
- Don't you get paid for making toys?

43
00:04:18,213 --> 00:04:20,807  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Who said toys?
- Toys?

44
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,281  X1:240 X2:475 Y1:493 Y2:516
False alarm, folks.

45
00:04:22,453 --> 00:04:26,002  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:516
There's no toys made.
Santa says everyone is naughty.

46
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:31,728  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's it! I'm delivering my boot
up Santa's chimney.

47
00:04:31,893 --> 00:04:35,522  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:454 Y2:516
- Where is he?
- There, in his ice fortress.

48
00:04:39,973 --> 00:04:43,283  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:516
We'll need help getting in.
Any volunteers?

49
00:04:46,213 --> 00:04:48,966  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I'll help you.
- Oh, phooey!

50
00:05:07,493 --> 00:05:10,007  X1:289 X2:428 Y1:456 Y2:516
- An omen?
- Dinner.

51
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:20,445  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:516
Let's see who's been naughty
and who's been naughty.

52
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:25,882  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:451 Y2:516
Mobsters beating up a shopkeeper
for protection money.

53
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:28,009  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:490 Y2:516
Very naughty.

54
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:34,285  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:451 Y2:516
Shopkeepers not paying protection
money. Exactly as naughty.

55
00:05:37,173 --> 00:05:39,403  X1:289 X2:427 Y1:495 Y2:516
I saw that!

56
00:05:41,013 --> 00:05:42,128  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:490 Y2:516
We brought your mail.

57
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:44,571  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:489 Y2:516
Don't you ever knock?

58
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:47,406  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:451 Y2:516
Who knows what naughty things
I could be watching?

59
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:51,805  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:456 Y2:516
- I get New Orleans on this thing.
- Don't kill us!

60
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:57,484  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:450 Y2:516
Santa's a robot. We should be able
to destroy him with a logical paradox.

61
00:05:57,653 --> 00:06:01,089  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:490 Y2:516
Bender, you better cover your ears.

62
00:06:01,253 --> 00:06:04,643  X1:221 X2:495 Y1:490 Y2:516
Holy night! Intruders!

63
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:07,202  X1:265 X2:451 Y1:059 Y2:082
Hold it, Santa.

64
00:06:08,373 --> 00:06:12,048  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:451 Y2:516
Consider this: You are programmed
to destroy the naughty.

65
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:15,250  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:456 Y2:516
But many of those you destroy
are in fact nice.

66
00:06:15,413 --> 00:06:20,203  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:451 Y2:516
I submit that you are naughty. So,
logically, you must destroy yourself.

67
00:06:27,973 --> 00:06:33,605  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:451 Y2:516
Nice try, but my head was built with
paradox-absorbing crumple zones.

68
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:58,050  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:489 Y2:516
Wait! This is what we're running from.

69
00:07:02,373 --> 00:07:03,601  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:495 Y2:516
Faster! Faster!

70
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:29,687  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:455 Y2:516
- Why aren't we moving?
- I don't know.

71
00:07:29,853 --> 00:07:32,845  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:451 Y2:516
Usually when I do stuff like this
the ship moves.

72
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:39,330  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:493 Y2:516
Ho, ho... Huh?

73
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:51,532  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:450 Y2:516
- He's trapped.
- Hooray!

74
00:07:51,693 --> 00:07:56,289  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Now we can make toys again!
- Toys! Toys! Toys!

75
00:07:56,453 --> 00:07:59,923  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:451 Y2:516
And I can deliver them.
Billions and billions in one night.

76
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:03,881  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:456 Y2:516
- No human could do all that.
- Evel Knievel could.

77
00:08:05,173 --> 00:08:08,768  X1:170 X2:544 Y1:455 Y2:516
Santa's right.
We need some sort of robot.

78
00:08:10,093 --> 00:08:12,323  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:489 Y2:516
Crap! I'm some sort of robot.

79
00:08:14,253 --> 00:08:15,572  X1:309 X2:407 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hooray!

80
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:17,325  X1:309 X2:407 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hooray!

81
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:19,643  X1:309 X2:407 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hooray!

82
00:08:23,813 --> 00:08:28,762  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:450 Y2:516
Bender can't be Santa. He wasn't
built to Yuletide specifications.

83
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:33,563  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:450 Y2:516
I wasn't built to steal Leela's purse
either, but that didn't stop me.

84
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:37,009  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Bender!
- Bow before your new Santa.

85
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:38,925  X1:298 X2:418 Y1:495 Y2:516
Our hero!

86
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:43,406  X1:179 X2:543 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>We are free and fairly sober</i>
<i>With so many toys to build</i>

87
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:47,646  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>The machines are kind of tricky</i>
<i>Probably someone will be killed</i>

88
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:49,565  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>But we gladly work for nothing</i>

89
00:08:49,773 --> 00:08:54,085  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Which is good</i>
<i>Because we don 't intend to pay</i>

90
00:08:54,693 --> 00:08:57,924  X1:143 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>The elves are back to work today</i>
<i>Hooray</i>

91
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:03,801  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>We have just a couple hours</i>
<i>To make several billion gifts</i>

92
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:08,172  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>- And the labor isn 't easy</i>
<i>- Then you'll all work triple shifts</i>

93
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:14,329  X1:105 X2:614 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>You can make the job go quicker</i>
<i>If you turn the controls to super speed</i>

94
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:17,844  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>- It's back to work on Xmas Eve</i>
<i>- Hooray</i>

95
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:24,602  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>And though you're cold, sore and ugly</i>
<i>Your pride will mask the pain</i>

96
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:31,042  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>- Let my happy smile warm your hearts</i>
<i>- There's a toy lodged in my brain</i>

97
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:35,008  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>We are getting awfully tired</i>
<i>And we can 't work any faster</i>

98
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:36,652  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:061 Y2:087
<i>We're very, very sorry</i>

99
00:09:36,813 --> 00:09:42,524  X1:144 X2:577 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>You selfish little bastards</i>
<i>The kids will think Santa is a jerk</i>

100
00:09:43,773 --> 00:09:46,845  X1:109 X2:612 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>Then shut your yaps and back to work</i>

101
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:51,562  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:456 Y2:516
<i>Now it's very nearly Xmas</i>
<i>And we've done the best we could</i>

102
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:54,611  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:456 Y2:516
<i>- These are poorly painted</i>
<i>- And made from inferior wood</i>

103
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:58,084  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>I should give you all a beating</i>
<i>But I have to fly</i>

104
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,370  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>If I weren 't stuck here</i>
<i>I'd harpoon you in the eye</i>

105
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:04,923  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Now it's back to our tenements</i>
<i>To drown ourselves in rye</i>

106
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:08,842  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>You did the best you could</i>
<i>Some of these gorillas are okay</i>

107
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:10,372  X1:247 X2:469 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Hooray!
- We're adequate!

108
00:10:10,573 --> 00:10:14,725  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>The elves have rescued Xmas Day</i>
<i>Hooray</i>

109
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:33,091  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:456 Y2:516
Gee, how are you gonna get through
these bars?

110
00:10:33,253 --> 00:10:35,892  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:450 Y2:516
I don't know, moron.
Suppose I bend them?

111
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,486  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:490 Y2:516
Okay.

112
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:41,687  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:489 Y2:516
Mommy! Santa's through the perimeter!

113
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:45,169  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:451 Y2:516
Kids, take your suicide pills
so you won't suffer!

114
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:50,322  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:450 Y2:516
No, wait! I'm the good Santa.
I've got toys at reasonable prices.

115
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:54,043  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:455 Y2:516
He's the father of all lies
and the uncle of all tricks!

116
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:57,370  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:455 Y2:516
- I've come bearing Tri-Ominos.
- Go for the shins!

117
00:11:05,413 --> 00:11:07,608  X1:273 X2:442 Y1:061 Y2:082
One down...

118
00:11:13,053 --> 00:11:18,366  X1:171 X2:543 Y1:451 Y2:516
Well, hello there, handsome.
Won't you have a cookie?

119
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:21,201  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:494 Y2:516
Don't mind if I do.

120
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:22,931  X1:204 X2:512 Y1:489 Y2:516
What's in these things?

121
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:26,682  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:516
Why don't you slip into something
more fiery?

122
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:41,693  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:451 Y2:516
Yo, Kringle,
what happened to you, dog?

123
00:11:41,973 --> 00:11:45,010  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's awful, Kwanza-Bot.
Everyone hates me.

124
00:11:45,533 --> 00:11:49,765  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516
At least they understand you.
Nobody's down with this Kwanza tip.

125
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:54,171  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Hey, maybe you can lend me a hand.
- No time.

126
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,688  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:490 Y2:516
I gotta hand out the Kwanza book.

127
00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:02,485  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:516
I've been giving these out
for 647 years.

128
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:16,206  X1:118 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
Bathtub eggnog,
just the way Grandma used to drink.

129
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:22,370  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:451 Y2:516
- It went sour!
- Can't I have a scented bath in peace?

130
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:27,328  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:451 Y2:516
Remember, professor, Bender is Santa.
So we don't need to hurt him, right?

131
00:12:27,493 --> 00:12:30,690  X1:162 X2:552 Y1:456 Y2:516
Yes, yes, yes.
You sound like a broken MP3.

132
00:12:31,653 --> 00:12:32,881  X1:306 X2:412 Y1:493 Y2:516
Ho, ho...

133
00:12:33,893 --> 00:12:36,965  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:516
Professor, don't you remember
what I told you?

134
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:38,691  X1:337 X2:379 Y1:495 Y2:516
No!

135
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:46,242  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:489 Y2:516
There's gotta be a better way.

136
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:54,282  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:489 Y2:516
Bender, you're a genius.

137
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:58,361  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:451 Y2:516
This creates an unrealistic
standard of beauty.

138
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:02,765  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:516
Now it's time for Santa
to screw open his present.

139
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:07,203  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:061 Y2:127
It's Santa!
We've got him cornered.

140
00:13:07,373 --> 00:13:12,208  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:061 Y2:126
- I smell a juicy promotion for me.
- And a juicy rehiring for me.

141
00:13:20,653 --> 00:13:23,963  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:456 Y2:516
This Xmas Day session of court
will come to order.

142
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:27,443  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:490 Y2:516
Honorable Judge Whitey presiding.

143
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:32,966  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:451 Y2:516
Santa, you stand accused of crimes
against humanity. How do you plead?

144
00:13:33,173 --> 00:13:36,722  X1:237 X2:478 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Not Santa.
- There he is again!

145
00:13:37,373 --> 00:13:42,242  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:455 Y2:516
Now, Pramala, I know it's scary
in the witness box.

146
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,525  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:494 Y2:516
But there ain't no need to fear me.

147
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:49,206  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:489 Y2:516
I'm sorry. I thought you was corn.

148
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:53,651  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:456 Y2:516
Now, would you please point
at that robot over there?

149
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:58,691  X1:221 X2:494 Y1:490 Y2:516
No further questions.

150
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:02,892  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:490 Y2:516
Daddy done good, huh?

151
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:09,481  X1:101 X2:615 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Haven't you been paid to testify?
- You gave me a dollar and some candy.

152
00:14:09,773 --> 00:14:14,085  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:450 Y2:516
Yet you haven't said what I told you
to say. How can we trust you?

153
00:14:16,373 --> 00:14:20,366  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Quit badgering the witness.
- Badger? Where?

154
00:14:22,173 --> 00:14:27,167  X1:149 X2:565 Y1:451 Y2:516
Whereas I have a ham dinner
waiting for me at my mansion...

155
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,006  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:490 Y2:516
...I find the defendant guilty.

156
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:35,811  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:456 Y2:516
Santa Claus, I hereby sentence you
to be executed at sundown.

157
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:41,405  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:455 Y2:516
It's not fair. I hope that dumb chicken
is ashamed of himself.

158
00:14:50,293 --> 00:14:54,923  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:451 Y2:516
Deactivated robot walking!
Deactivated robot walking here!

159
00:14:57,893 --> 00:15:02,444  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:451 Y2:516
Santa, when you see the robot devil,
tell him I'm coming.

160
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,166  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:456 Y2:516
- That guy said to tell you...
- I heard him.

161
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:19,926  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:451 Y2:516
Greetings, masters.
My companion and I made lots of toys.

162
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:24,132  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:516
Out of my way. We're taking Santa
to prove Bender's innocence.

163
00:15:28,453 --> 00:15:32,366  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:455 Y2:516
Do what you will, but we'll see
who has the last ho.

164
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:38,088  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:451 Y2:516
- There.
- Oh, no! The ice is melting!

165
00:15:38,253 --> 00:15:41,484  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:516
The factory's pollution
caused a greenhouse effect.

166
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:44,486  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:451 Y2:516
- That would explain this heat.
- And your shorts.

167
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,843  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:490 Y2:516
Yeah, that would explain it.

168
00:16:20,253 --> 00:16:24,405  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:453 Y2:516
We've got to think of a way to save
Bender, or Xmas will be ruined!

169
00:16:24,573 --> 00:16:26,450  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:490 Y2:516
Especially for Bender.

170
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:35,285  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:451 Y2:516
Look out, Earth.
I'm dreaming of a red Xmas.

171
00:16:43,893 --> 00:16:46,327  X1:243 X2:471 Y1:490 Y2:516
Good old Maggie.

172
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:51,525  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:451 Y2:516
When I pull the switch, these
electromagnets will tear you apart.

173
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:56,403  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:456 Y2:516
- A most humane death.
- But that doesn't sound humane!

174
00:16:56,613 --> 00:17:00,003  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:451 Y2:516
It is for the witnesses
because it's not boring.

175
00:17:03,413 --> 00:17:07,691  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:451 Y2:516
When this random-number generator
reaches zero, you'll be executed.

176
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:15,127  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:489 Y2:516
"Ten. Three. Twelve. Three" again.

177
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,370  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Stop the execution!
- Leela!

178
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:19,125  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:489 Y2:516
"Fifteen. Negative eight."

179
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:24,321  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:455 Y2:516
- I'll prove you've got the wrong Santa.
- I'm Santa Claus!

180
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:27,809  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:453 Y2:516
- What? "Twenty-seven."
- No, I'm Santa Claus.

181
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,686  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:455 Y2:516
- "Six"!
- We're also Santa Claus.

182
00:17:30,893 --> 00:17:32,770  X1:189 X2:525 Y1:492 Y2:516
And I'm his friend, Jesus.

183
00:17:32,973 --> 00:17:36,727  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:451 Y2:516
If you execute him,
you have to execute all of us.

184
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:40,812  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:450 Y2:516
You people aren't Santa.
You're not even robots. "Ninety-one."

185
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:45,728  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:451 Y2:516
How dare you lie in front of Jesus!
Hey, "zero"!

186
00:17:47,973 --> 00:17:49,406  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:490 Y2:516
No! Not the magnet!

187
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:02,772  X1:231 X2:485 Y1:451 Y2:516
- This is horrible.
- But it's not boring.

188
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:06,728  X1:285 X2:431 Y1:493 Y2:516
Ho, ho, ho.

189
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:14,733  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:454 Y2:516
My God! The real Santa!
Get him, Jesus!

190
00:18:14,973 --> 00:18:17,692  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:490 Y2:516
I help those who help themselves.

191
00:18:19,173 --> 00:18:22,290  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:456 Y2:516
Santa, you saved my life.
Please don't kill me!

192
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:29,492  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm not here to kill you, Bender.
I need you to help me save Xmas.

193
00:18:31,213 --> 00:18:35,445  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:451 Y2:516
Gee whiz, Santa,
you want me to help you?

194
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:39,646  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:453 Y2:516
- Don't do it! He's evil!
- I know he is, but I have no choice.

195
00:18:39,813 --> 00:18:46,207  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm late. If I don't complete my brutal
rampage, it just wouldn't be Xmas.

196
00:18:46,373 --> 00:18:48,125  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:489 Y2:516
I guess what I'm asking is:

197
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:52,212  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:450 Y2:516
Bender, won't you join
my slaying tonight?

198
00:18:52,413 --> 00:18:55,689  X1:219 X2:495 Y1:492 Y2:516
Well, 'tis the season.

199
00:19:16,493 --> 00:19:19,053  X1:235 X2:480 Y1:451 Y2:516
- My hair!
- My wedding cake!

200
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:21,844  X1:281 X2:434 Y1:495 Y2:516
Let it snow!

201
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:26,686  X1:241 X2:475 Y1:490 Y2:516
Merry Xmas, kids.

202
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:38,166  X1:235 X2:480 Y1:490 Y2:516
This wangs chung.

203
00:19:38,373 --> 00:19:42,048  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:456 Y2:516
After all the good we tried to do,
Xmas turned out rotten.

204
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:43,566  X1:287 X2:429 Y1:451 Y2:516
- No heat.
- No power.

205
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:47,442  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:451 Y2:516
Huddled together in fear
like lice in a burning wig.

206
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:51,248  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:456 Y2:516
Maybe your futuristic Xmas
isn't so rotten after all.

207
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:54,610  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:451 Y2:516
What are you talking about?
You said it yourself:

208
00:19:54,773 --> 00:19:58,368  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:451 Y2:516
Xmas should bring people together,
not blow them apart.

209
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:03,124  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:516
Don't you see? Fear has brought us
together. That's the magic of Xmas.

210
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,642  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:489 Y2:516
That's a big crock of...

211
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:07,691  X1:301 X2:414 Y1:495 Y2:516
Hold me!

212
00:20:14,853 --> 00:20:17,970  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:493 Y2:516
On, Trasher! On, Smasher!

213
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:21,205  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Kwanza-Bot, where you off to?
- Didn't you hear?

214
00:20:21,373 --> 00:20:24,763  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:451 Y2:516
Chanukah Zombie is having a luau.
You coming?

215
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,645  X1:319 X2:396 Y1:495 Y2:516
Word!

216
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:33,609  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:450 Y2:516
Here's a small token of my appreciation
for being Santa while I was trapped.

217
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:38,852  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:451 Y2:516
Chief, you screwed up.
There's nothing here.

218
00:20:39,053 --> 00:20:42,568  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:451 Y2:516
Oh, it might appear empty
but the message is clear:

219
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:47,682  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:451 Y2:516
Play Santa again,
and I'll kill you next year!

220
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:57,170  X1:285 X2:431 Y1:493 Y2:516
Ho, ho, ho!
