How do you plead?

166
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:05,034
Not inno-guilty-cent.

167
00:07:07,037 --> 00:07:10,139
BENDER:
<i>And then the Donbot said,</i>
<i>"Sorry, Calculon,"

168
00:07:10,174 --> 00:07:11,341
and then Calculon said,

169
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:16,145
"No...!"

170
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:17,580
I think we've heard enough.

171
00:07:17,614 --> 00:07:18,981
Wait, I'm not finished.

172
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:20,650
...o!
Now I'm finished.

173
00:07:20,684 --> 00:07:23,420
Your Honor,
the prosecution roosts.

174
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:26,255
(clucks)

175
00:07:30,294 --> 00:07:32,129
Have you reached a verdict?

176
00:07:32,163 --> 00:07:33,330
Indeed.

177
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:36,033
After a steamy
12-way deliberation,

178
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:37,635
we find the accused guilty as...

179
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:39,036
(door opens)
CALCULON:
Wait.

180
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,605
The Donbot is innocent.

181
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,139
(gasping)

182
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:45,075
Calculon,
who is that escorting you?

183
00:07:45,109 --> 00:07:47,011
Yes, who?

184
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:49,380
My personal trainer,
and he's trained me

185
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:52,416
to say that my wounds
were self-inflicted,

186
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:56,086
for you see I am
a big Hollywood idiot dumb guy

187
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:57,788
what does dat sort of ting.

188
00:07:57,822 --> 00:07:59,623
Poifect.

189
00:07:59,657 --> 00:08:01,959
(indistinct whispering)

190
00:08:01,993 --> 00:08:04,494
We find the Donbot...

191
00:08:04,528 --> 00:08:05,995
Dramatic pause.

192
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,430
...not guilty.

193
00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:09,365
(gasping)

194
00:08:13,404 --> 00:08:15,338
Honey, if you're
marrying Bender,

195
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:18,041
you might want to get
a black dress for the wedding.

196
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:19,776
That's going
to look hot.

197
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:27,316
(sobbing)

198
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,018
Don't be scared, Bender.

199
00:08:29,052 --> 00:08:31,286
We're putting you in the
Witness Relocation Program.

200
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:32,488
You'll be given
a new identity,

201
00:08:32,522 --> 00:08:35,157
a new place to live,
and this iPod.

202
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:36,592
I don't want it
anymore.

203
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:38,527
So I got to hide forever?

204
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:41,564
No, just until the Robot
Mafia finds and kills you.

205
00:08:41,598 --> 00:08:43,599
They're pretty good
at that.

206
00:08:46,137 --> 00:08:47,538
Good-bye, Professor.

207
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:50,040
Before I leave,
I just want you to know

208
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:53,010
I've never done
any work whatsoever.

209
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:57,783
Zoidberg, I know it seems
like I can't stand you.

210
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:01,220
(voice cracking):
Leela, you'll have
to watch out for Fry now.

211
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:02,722
Oh, Lord.

212
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:05,358
(sobbing):
I wish I could go
with you, pal.

213
00:09:05,393 --> 00:09:06,560
Me, too.

214
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:08,094
I'll need a butler.

215
00:09:08,128 --> 00:09:10,597
Bender, we have to go.

216
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:27,379
There'll never be
another like him.

217
00:09:27,414 --> 00:09:29,682
Let's hire
someone better.

218
00:09:32,552 --> 00:09:34,519
Clamps.

219
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:36,120
Clamps!
Huh?

220
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:38,189
Listen to my boss words.

221
00:09:38,223 --> 00:09:40,991
I would like you to apply
for Bender's old job

222
00:09:41,026 --> 00:09:44,127
and cozy up to this Fry,
his best friend.

223
00:09:44,162 --> 00:09:47,564
Yeah, and then I'll introduce
him to my best friend--

224
00:09:47,598 --> 00:09:49,533
clamp number one!

225
00:09:49,568 --> 00:09:51,001
Sorry, toots.

226
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:53,169
No, Clamps.
No clamps.

227
00:09:53,204 --> 00:09:56,039
Sooner or later
Bender will contact Fry,

228
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:58,675
as relocated squealers
always do.

229
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:01,612
Then with the clamps, Francis.

230
00:10:01,646 --> 00:10:04,481
Francis... Francis?

231
00:10:04,515 --> 00:10:06,116
I'll clamp you
with the Francis!

232
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,585
(grunting angrily)
Hey, oh,
take it ease.

233
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,421
(doorbell rings)

234
00:10:10,455 --> 00:10:13,290
Hey there, slick,
I'm here about the job.

235
00:10:13,325 --> 00:10:14,625
Take a seat.

236
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:16,794
We'll begin the
interviews shortly.

237
00:10:21,132 --> 00:10:22,700
We'll start with Andrew.
(gasps)

238
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:25,669
Yeah, they all
kind of broke.

239
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:28,071
So, when do I start?

240
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:30,074
Everyone, this is Francis.

241
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:31,275
Hey, Francis.
Hello, Francis.

242
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:33,043
Hello.
Cute name.

243
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:35,078
Look what he can do.

244
00:10:36,814 --> 00:10:38,648
Wow!
Whoa!
Oh!

245
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:42,652
Yeah, I do it all-- clamping,
crimping, occasional snipping.

246
00:10:42,686 --> 00:10:44,720
Snipping?
(laughs)

247
00:10:44,755 --> 00:10:48,057
Looks like you may be
out of a job, Zoidberg.

248
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:50,059
Ha, ha, ha, that's all good fun,

249
00:10:50,094 --> 00:10:52,128
but of course a clamp
is no substitute

250
00:10:52,163 --> 00:10:54,364
for the precision
of a genuine...

251
00:10:54,398 --> 00:10:56,198
Francis, would you do
the honors?

252
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:58,568
(crying)

253
00:10:58,602 --> 00:10:59,769
Stay off my turf!

254
00:10:59,803 --> 00:11:01,170
Yeesh.

255
00:11:01,204 --> 00:11:03,571
That guy can bite
my shiny metal clamps.

256
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:05,073
(laughs)

257
00:11:05,107 --> 00:11:07,508
You remind me of my
old friend Bender.

258
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:10,277
Oh, yeah?
Where does he safely live?

259
00:11:10,312 --> 00:11:13,347
I don't know. Hey, you want
to come to my house and play?

260
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,116
Yeah, sounds like freakin' fun.

261
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,686
♪ ♪

262
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:32,598
(exhaust hissing)

263
00:11:35,336 --> 00:11:37,738
♪ ♪

264
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:46,048
Eh, four stinking years
of clamping school for this?!

265
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:48,316
Greetings, Francis.

266
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,653
Sorry if I was
a little hostile before,

267
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:54,557
but snipping is the only reason
I'm even tolerated around here.

268
00:11:54,591 --> 00:11:59,262
Not like you, with those
magnificent squeezers.

269
00:11:59,296 --> 00:12:01,998
Squeezers? Squeezers?!

270
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:03,266
They're clamps,
you (bleep)!

271
00:12:03,301 --> 00:12:06,003
If I want to (bleep)
snip with these clamps,

272
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:08,439
I will snip with these
(bleep) clamps!

273
00:12:08,473 --> 00:12:10,608
Why do you think
they call me...

274
00:12:10,642 --> 00:12:12,310
Francis?

275
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:15,614
Francis,
I have good news!

276
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:17,783
It's time
for your first delivery...

277
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:19,752
to the moon!

278
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:23,122
Fan (bleep) tastic!

279
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,604
Here's the 200 feet of rope
you ordered, Sheriff Furley.

280
00:12:40,638 --> 00:12:42,372
Hot diggity!

281
00:12:42,407 --> 00:12:45,141
You fellers want to stick around
for the hanging tomorrow?

282
00:12:45,176 --> 00:12:46,643
It's gonna be a doozy.

283
00:12:48,145 --> 00:12:49,713
I sure do love
hanging people.

284
00:12:49,747 --> 00:12:51,214
(laughs)

285
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:53,083
Well, I best start
cutting the nooses.

286
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:55,084
Oh, you know
who could help with that?

287
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:56,419
(claws clicking)

288
00:12:56,454 --> 00:12:58,621
Francis!

289
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:04,360
Nice job, Francis.

290
00:13:04,394 --> 00:13:05,995
I like how
you didn't get drunk

291
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:07,563
and steal anyone's organs,
like our old robot.

292
00:13:07,597 --> 00:13:09,131
Bender?!

293
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:15,136
Bender, it's me Fry!

294
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,804
Hee-yah!

295
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:29,959
I knew Bender would turn up
purely by coincidence.

296
00:13:29,993 --> 00:13:32,495
Take care of him,
but do it quietly.

297
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,963
Don't worry.

298
00:13:33,998 --> 00:13:36,533
We're in space,
where no one can hear you clamp.

299
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,635
(laughs)

300
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,304
What do you know?

301
00:13:40,338 --> 00:13:42,806
The Feds gave Bender
a new identity as a moon farmer.

302
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,775
He must be afraid
to break character,

303
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:46,910
in case there's any robot mafia
scuzzballs around.

304
00:13:46,945 --> 00:13:48,312
Huh?

305
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:50,481
Come on, let's
go check on him.

306
00:13:50,515 --> 00:13:52,382
I checked on a guy once.

307
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:55,052
I checked him into tiny pieces!

308
00:13:55,086 --> 00:13:56,487
Bender?

309
00:13:56,521 --> 00:13:57,788
Nope, don't recollect

310
00:13:57,822 --> 00:13:59,523
nobody by that name.

311
00:13:59,557 --> 00:14:01,991
But let me ask my
son-in-law. Billy?

312
00:14:02,026 --> 00:14:03,560
Yes, Moon-Pa?

313
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,896
These nice big-city
hillbillies are looking

314
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,698
for someone named Bender.

315
00:14:07,732 --> 00:14:09,433
You know him?

316
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:12,837
Nope. He ain't any
of the eight people I ever met.

317
00:14:12,871 --> 00:14:14,639
Bender, it's us,
your friends.

318
00:14:14,673 --> 00:14:17,008
You can drop
the hillbilly moron act.

319
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:18,876
Sorry, mister,
but I'm no Bender.

320
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:21,246
I'm just a simple farmer.

321
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,981
Name's Billy West.

322
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:24,449
(laughs)
Billy West?

323
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:27,352
What a stupid, phony,
made-up name.

324
00:14:27,386 --> 00:14:28,986
You city folk
are probably hungry

325
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:31,756
from premarital sex
and flag-burning.

326
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,825
Y'all want to stay
for supper?

327
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:36,528
Well, my boyfriend and I
were going to have sex

328
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:39,297
on a burning flag,
but I could have a bite.

329
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:45,604
May I present my beautiful
robot wife, the Crushinator.

330
00:14:45,638 --> 00:14:48,406
She's serving up the dinner
and the charm.

331
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,041
Mashed chicken,
Mr. Fry?

332
00:14:50,076 --> 00:14:51,676
Sure.

333
00:14:56,348 --> 00:14:58,917
So, uh, Billy,
where were you born?

334
00:14:58,951 --> 00:15:00,986
Right here in moon country.

335
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,255
And how long have
you been a farmer?

336
00:15:03,289 --> 00:15:05,356
Reckon I was born a farmer.

337
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:07,859
Folks say my mama was a hoe.

338
00:15:07,893 --> 00:15:11,596
Oh, dear, I seem
to have warped my fork.

339
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,332
Could you bend it back
for me, Billy?

340
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:16,835
Bend it?
I can't even lift it.

341
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:20,973
Which is weird, seeing as how
my daddy was a forklift.

342
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:23,242
(quietly):
Wow. Bender is
really committed

343
00:15:23,276 --> 00:15:25,578
to his new
Jethrovian identity.

344
00:15:25,646 --> 00:15:27,947
If y'all are finished,

345
00:15:27,982 --> 00:15:31,051
I'll drive y'all back to town
in the old clunker.

346
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:35,922
So, y'all flew here
in a spacey ship?

347
00:15:35,956 --> 00:15:37,457
Stop talking
like that!

348
00:15:37,491 --> 00:15:38,792
You live
on the moon!

349
00:15:38,826 --> 00:15:40,360
If that is Bender,

350
00:15:40,394 --> 00:15:42,395
I guess he's just happier
in his new life.

351
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,931
I refuse to believe
anyone is happy!

352
00:15:44,966 --> 00:15:48,635
Mr. West, would you mind
if I examined your brain?

353
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,003
Examine?

354
00:15:50,038 --> 00:15:52,906
Heck, if you
can find it,
you can keep it.

355
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:56,410

Gadzooks!

358
00:15:59,613 --> 00:16:01,247
Bender's hard drive

359
00:16:01,282 --> 00:16:03,583
no longer contains any
of his old memories!

360
00:16:03,618 --> 00:16:05,385
When the Feds
bumpkinized him,

361
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:08,388
they completely
wiped out his old identity!

362
00:16:08,422 --> 00:16:09,489
(all gasping)

363
00:16:09,524 --> 00:16:11,424
Well, I don't know about that,

364
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,861
but who am I to argue
with a man from the sky?

365
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:17,397
So long,
space heroes.

366
00:16:20,702 --> 00:16:24,337
You sure you don't
want to kill all humans?

367
00:16:24,372 --> 00:16:26,740
(splutters)
I love all humans.

368
00:16:26,774 --> 00:16:28,274
(sniffles)

369
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:30,743
He really is gone.

370
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:37,816
I guess
I'm happy for him.

371
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,918
And honestly,
Francis is a way better friend

372
00:16:39,952 --> 00:16:41,620
than Bender ever was.

373
00:16:41,654 --> 00:16:43,721
Hey, where is
Francis?

374
00:16:43,756 --> 00:16:46,624
(lively music and chatter)

375
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,828
One sarsapar-oil-la,
Sheriff.

376
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:52,330
I'm thirsty.

377
00:16:52,364 --> 00:16:53,698
Make it two.

378
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:55,433
I'm greedy.

379
00:16:55,468 --> 00:16:57,836
You got the rest fooled,
but not me.

380
00:16:57,871 --> 00:17:01,975
Now let's take this outside,
so's no one else gets clamped.

381
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:05,012
You're the
boss, stranger.

382
00:17:07,415 --> 00:17:11,252
I'm gonna clamp your
body parts off one by one.

383
00:17:11,286 --> 00:17:13,420
But then I'm gonna clamp
your wounds shut

384
00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:16,023
so you stay alive...
while I clamp you some more!

385
00:17:16,057 --> 00:17:18,558
Say your prayers, stoolie.

386
00:17:18,593 --> 00:17:20,293
Okay.

387
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:23,296
God bless Grandma
and Grandpa...
They're next!

388
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,598
Right now I'm gonna cut
your damn head off!

why?!

Because our friend Francis here
is in reality a bad murderer.

Yup. He was fixin'
to kill me.

I put off my singing career

Bender was a hell of a squealer.

Maybe the best there ever was.

A wise man once said
he was a hell of a squealer.

I'm-a no Bender.

You're probably right.

Pizza's here.
Whoo!

00:20:45,904 --> 00:20:48,175
I'll just cut that...

You do, and I'll (bleep)
gut you like a fish.
