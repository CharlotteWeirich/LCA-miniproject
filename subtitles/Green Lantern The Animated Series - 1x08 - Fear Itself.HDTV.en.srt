I'll pick you up
after work. I promise.

00:00:09,104 --> 00:00:13,040
Maybe we'll be back in time for
your date with Carol after all.

5
00:00:13,108 --> 00:00:15,943
Dinner will have to wait.
We're here now.

6
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:18,880
We fight them.
We stop them.

7
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:28,840
Is that all it takes
to stop a Green Lantern...

8
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:31,175
a broken heart?

00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:34,879
You want to talk about it,
Sir Mopes-a-lot?

10
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:38,283
No.
I miss Galia, ok?

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,118
Hey, I know.
You're not the only one

Thank you, Aya. That's
exactly what I'm talking about.

17
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:57,602
So, Kilowog, you're in charge.
What's your move?

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,972
Look, Jordan, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

So you're, what, Pink Lanterns?

37
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,945
Not precisely, Green Lantern.

Where you value willpower,

39
00:02:16,014 --> 00:02:20,518
the Star Sapphires channel the power

How do you happen to be
in this neck of the woods?

This sector of space is ours.

But pardon my manners.
I am Aga'po.

This is my niece Gieta.

You're mighty handy
with those power rings.

47
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:52,483
We sure could use your help
fighting the Red Lantern corps.

48
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:55,553
I would enjoy allying
myself with you, Hal Jordan.

49
00:02:56,622 --> 00:02:58,256
We are close to our home planet.

50
00:02:58,323 --> 00:03:01,459
Perhaps you'd accompany us
for rest and repair

51
00:03:01,527 --> 00:03:03,094
before you resume your mission?

52

[chuckles]
I don't mind if I do.

Course plotted for Zamaron.

54
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:20,111
Kilowog, you seem so bereft.

55
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:22,613
I'd rather not talk about it.

56
00:03:23,982 --> 00:03:28,052
You suffer from a great loss.
A broken heart.

57
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:09,160
Razer, you sure
you don't want to come out?

58
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:10,695
They're throwing us a party.

59
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:14,031
How delightful for you.
I'll pass.

00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,301
Not a people person yet,
but we're working on him.

61
00:04:19,905 --> 00:04:22,507
Aga'po, you weren't surprised
when you saw us.

62
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:24,642
How do you know about
the Green Lanterns?

63
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,579
Long ago, we were of one race
with your masters.

64
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:32,717
You and the guardians?
Thanks for putting that in my head.

65
00:04:32,784 --> 00:04:35,052
And usually, hot girls
don't go for the nerds.

66
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,090
It was long ago.
We took very different paths.

67
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:42,960
They refused to allow any emotion
to influence their judgment.

68
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:46,230
We found this insufferable
and foolish.

69
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:48,399
Sounds like our guardians, all right.

70
00:04:51,103 --> 00:04:54,772
My people believe that only
love can save the universe.

71
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,310
Love fuels our rings.
Its power is unfathomable.

72
00:05:03,181 --> 00:05:05,950
<i>Hail, Queen Aga'po.</i>

73
00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:12,290
We will celebrate
with a feast this evening.

74
00:05:12,357 --> 00:05:16,561
Gieta, entertain them
until then, yes?

75
00:05:16,628 --> 00:05:19,130
So, not that I'm complaining,

76
00:05:19,197 --> 00:05:22,233
but are we going to be
the only men folk at this party?

77
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:26,137
We of Zamaron have found that
life is more peaceful and loving

78
00:05:26,204 --> 00:05:28,306
when women are in charge.

79
00:05:28,373 --> 00:05:30,641
I don't know.
I've had some female bosses

80
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:32,109
who could be a real pain in the...

81
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:34,045
We have some time
before the feast, Hal Jordan.

82
00:05:34,112 --> 00:05:36,714
May I show you some sights?

83
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:38,950
[sighs]

84
00:05:51,496 --> 00:05:56,300
Well, Hal Jordan? Is it not
the most wondrous of places?

85
00:05:56,368 --> 00:05:58,002
Yes.

86
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,372
Uh, but let's not be late
for the banquet.

87
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,375
We shouldn't keep your aunt,
the Queen, waiting.

88
00:06:17,055 --> 00:06:20,257
Galia?
Is it really you?

89
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:22,660
Hello, my love.

90
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:24,195
What are you doing here?

91
00:06:24,262 --> 00:06:26,864
And in one of them
Star Sapphire outfits?

92
00:06:26,932 --> 00:06:28,366
Don't you like it?

93
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:31,702
Baby, you'd look good
in a gorlian sand sack.

94
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,872
But I don't understand.
How is this possible?

95
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,874
- How did you...
- Hush.

96
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:39,043
I have something to show you,

97
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:43,714
something to keep our love
alive and thriving forever.

98
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,189
Repairs from the attack
are complete,

99
00:06:52,257 --> 00:06:54,725
but Green Lantern Kilowog
is not responding.

100
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:58,529
- His energy level has gone flat.
- He's dead?

101
00:06:58,597 --> 00:07:01,899
No. He seems to be
in stasis.

102
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:06,538
I knew this planet was going to
be more trouble than it was worth.

103
00:07:07,606 --> 00:07:09,073
<i>Interceptor to Hal Jordan.</i>

104
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:12,243
<i>Kilowog's not answering hails.
Is he with you?</i>

105
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,814
Kilowog's a big boy, Razer.
[chuckles] I'm sure he's fine.

106
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:29,656
What is taking so long?

107
00:07:29,724 --> 00:07:32,492
These Lanterns can help us
much more than ordinary males.

108
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,594
The Bolovaxian came willingly.

109
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,730
The earthling should be
as easily persuaded.

110
00:07:36,798 --> 00:07:41,101
<i>My Queen, Hal Jordan is different
from any other male I've met.</i>

111
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,604
<i>I've never felt like this,
never experienced the...</i>

112
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,774
Remember who is supposed to
fall in love with whom, Gieta.

113
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:51,278
Take stronger actions, or I will.

114

[gasps]

115
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:04,491
Delicious.
What is it?

116
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:07,027
The juice of the Kavleen fruit.

117
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:11,298
It's said to replenish the
spirit and enhance the senses.

118
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:14,468
This is my favorite place
in the palace.

119
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,204
- Is the view not wonderful?
- Yes.

120
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:21,041
It's... romantic, don't you think?

121
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:23,910
Very.

122
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:36,590
Of course.
He already has a true love.

123
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:39,359
How else could he resist Gieta?

<i>At this point, we'd advise you</i>

130

I don't wish to harm you,
but know that I will.

140
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:50,363
- Now, stand aside.
- Stop.

141
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:52,032
This is an honored guest,

142
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,635
one of the heroes who rescued me
so valiantly today.

143
00:09:55,703 --> 00:09:59,239
Now, tell me,
what's bothering you?

144
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,909
What have you done to Kilowog?
Where is he?

145
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,312
I do not know where he is
at the moment,

146
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:07,647
but I am certain he has come
to no harm.

147
00:10:07,715 --> 00:10:11,518
Come. We'll find
your comrade together.

148
00:10:11,586 --> 00:10:13,987
Kilowog's life force signal
is nearby,

149
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:16,623
but his vital signs are too weak
for me to pinpoint.

150
00:10:16,691 --> 00:10:18,658
Robot, you are not welcome.

151
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:20,393
But I must. I am...

152
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:23,263
We have no use
for emotionless machines.

153
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,565
Your presence is tolerated
on my planet

154
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:28,068
only because of
the heroes you serve.

155
00:10:28,136 --> 00:10:30,137
Wait here, Aya.

156
00:10:33,307 --> 00:10:35,809
I will conduct my own search.

157
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,917
I wonder how Kilowog's doing.
Maybe we should look for him.

158
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:45,952
You seem tense, Hal Jordan.

00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,788
Look, you shouldn't...
Ahh. Ha.

160
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,625
That does feel pretty good.

161
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:55,395
Ah. Let's... let's give him a few
more minutes to turn up on his own.

162
00:10:55,463 --> 00:11:00,300
And you should really stop that.
In 4 or 5 hours.

163
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,336
[beeping]

164
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,051
[beeps]
Razer, I must speak with you immediately.

165
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,865
[grunts]

166
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:35,869
Ahh!

167
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,711
Ohh!

168
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,982
Stop!

169
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:31,591
What a shock.
Kilowog's not here, either.

170
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:34,561
Worry not.
We'll find him.

171
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:40,066
I always get what I want.
I am the Queen.

172
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,636
[both grunt]

173
00:12:42,703 --> 00:12:46,606
Razer,
they have imprisoned Kilowog.

174
00:12:51,712 --> 00:12:54,948
Let me get you a refill,
Hal Jordan.

175
00:13:08,062 --> 00:13:11,731
- Green Lantern?
- Carol?

176
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:14,034
The ring said
it'd take me to my love, but...

177
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:19,506
It's you.
You're Hal.

178
00:13:19,573 --> 00:13:21,574
Oh, Hal. Oh.

179
00:13:21,642 --> 00:13:24,311
I can't believe I was
ever fooled by this stupid mask.

180
00:13:24,378 --> 00:13:26,513
Carol, I don't understand.

181
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,382
How... how can you be here?
How on...

182
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,451
I thought you were dead. I...

183
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,121
Oh, Hal, I thought
I'd never see you again.

184
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,826
I see I've interrupted something.

185
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:42,395
No, no. Carol, I...

186
00:13:42,463 --> 00:13:44,197
Ahh! [grunts]

187
00:13:44,265 --> 00:13:47,133
[grunts]

188
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,836
All this time,
I thought you were dead.

189
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:52,272
Well, now you're going
to wish you were dead.

190
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:58,917
You've got it all wrong, baby.
She's just a friend.

191
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:03,621
Don't worry, sister. I won't
forget your part in this.

192
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:06,091
You're suffering delirium
from the transformation.

193
00:14:06,158 --> 00:14:08,293
We Star Sapphires are
beings of love.

194
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,229
Carol, stop.
I don't know how you got here,

195
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:14,132
or into that outfit, which you
look great in, by the way, but...

196
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,769
Oh, I do, because your little
tramp here is in the same outfit.

197
00:14:17,837 --> 00:14:20,271
You've got to shake this off.
Whatever they've done to you...

198
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,707
What they did is give me power.

199
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:24,309
[grunts]

200
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:27,746
You let me think you were dead.

201
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:31,249
And all the while, it was just
party time for old Hal, wasn't it?

202
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:34,219
First of all, nothing happened
between me and Gieta.

203
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:38,256
And second, this is nuts.
Let's just talk.

204
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:40,492
You want to talk?
Talk to the hand.

205
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,960
Oh!

206
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:44,996
Do not believe
the soulless automaton.

207
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:49,000
I have ample reason
to trust her over any of you.

208
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:51,536
Guards, take them.

209
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:01,679
[grunts]

210
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:04,082
[grunts]

211
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:11,322
- Let me go!
- I won't.

212
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,225
Letting go of you the first time
was the hardest thing I've ever done.

213
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:17,996
- You're lying again!
- Carol...

214
00:15:20,032 --> 00:15:21,533
If that's what you think...

215
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:47,859
Hal?

216
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:50,862
What's going on?
Where on Earth are we?

217
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,532
We're not on Earth, Carol.
It may sound crazy,

218
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,001
but we're on the other side
of the galaxy

219
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:59,103
on the front lines of a war.

220
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:02,140
If my friends and I can't stop
this Red Lantern invasion,

221
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,742
we lose everything.

222
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,246
And that's why I'm out here
and not with you.

223
00:16:08,314 --> 00:16:12,150
Hal, I don't understand
all of this.

224
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:15,286
But if Earth needs someone
fighting for us out here,

225
00:16:15,354 --> 00:16:18,556
they couldn't have chosen a braver
or more resourceful champion.

226
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:20,725
Handsome.
You forgot handsome.

227
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:22,227
Carol Farris,

228
00:16:22,294 --> 00:16:25,196
you can keep him here
safe from harm,

229
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:26,831
safe from the war.

230
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:29,767
The power of your love
can hold him here.

231
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:32,837
Oh, honey, that's not love.
That's selfishness.

232
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:34,839
Real love is sacrifice,

233
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:36,641
putting another's needs
before your own,

234
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:41,646
doing what's best
for the person you love. Here.

235
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:43,114
You can have this ring back.

236
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:45,350
Pink's not really my color.

237
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:47,218
Though I will miss the boots.

238
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:52,323
But... no one has ever rejected
the Star Sapphire power ring.

239
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:54,759
No one has ever had
the strength.

240
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:57,095
You look pretty strong to me.

241
00:16:57,162 --> 00:17:00,265
You shame me,
Carol Farris of Earth.

242
00:17:00,332 --> 00:17:03,668
I did not truly
understand love until now.

243
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:06,437
You will be returned
to your home planet.

244
00:17:10,175 --> 00:17:11,209
Carol, I...

245
00:17:11,277 --> 00:17:14,612
Do whatever you have to do,
then come home to me.

246
00:17:29,828 --> 00:17:31,362
[distant explosion]

247
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,965
<i>Green Lantern Hal, you are needed.</i>

248
00:17:38,837 --> 00:17:41,172
Just where Aya said he'd be.

249
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,114
Galia.

250
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:52,050
Oh. You.

251
00:17:52,117 --> 00:17:55,053
What'd you do that for?
I was so happy!

252
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,923
Yeah, I'm the bad guy for not
letting you stay a lawn ornament.

253
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:01,793
Snap out of it, sergeant.
We have a war to fight.

254
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,229
[all grunting]

255
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:13,137
[grunting]

256
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:14,806
[groans]

257
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:21,646
You will surrender Kilowog, witch.

258
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:27,018
Child, your friend is happy,
like you soon will be.

259
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:31,356
Aga'po, please listen.
We must release the men.

260
00:18:31,423 --> 00:18:35,226
We've been laboring under an
imperfect understanding of love.

261
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:37,195
Earthling Carol Farris
rejected the ring

262
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:39,664
and put her love's needs
ahead of her own.

263
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:42,266
- That is true...
- Silence!

264
00:18:42,334 --> 00:18:44,268
Men spread war.

265
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:47,138
The Star Sapphires bring
the gift of love.

266
00:18:47,206 --> 00:18:50,875
The galaxy will know peace only
when all men have been gentled

267
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:53,177
by love's violet light.

268
00:19:01,236 --> 00:19:03,771
<i>So, you did have a true love.</i>

269
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:07,408
<i>One who died...</i>

270
00:19:07,476 --> 00:19:11,179
<i>but whose form lives again.</i>

271
00:19:11,246 --> 00:19:13,314
In this robot.

272
00:19:15,258 --> 00:19:19,253
It's true. You.
You were in my mind.

273
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:22,823
You stole the image of Alanna
from my memories.

274
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:24,425
I meant no harm.

275
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:25,993
I simply based
my mechanical form

276
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:28,262
on the last imprint I had
in my database.

277
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,465
Enough talk.
This Red Lantern is dead inside.

278
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:35,603
He has nothing to fuel us.
It is a mercy to destroy him.

279
00:19:37,272 --> 00:19:38,706
Aah!

280
00:19:38,774 --> 00:19:40,708
By the way,
is that a "no" on the whole

281
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:44,145
teaming up against the threat
to the galaxy question?

282
00:19:50,852 --> 00:19:53,421
Summon the Cephalon!

[all grunting]

00:20:19,097 --> 00:20:22,533
Go, Hal Jordan.
Go while you can.

287
00:20:23,735 --> 00:20:25,603
I owe you one.

288
00:20:31,276 --> 00:20:34,211
- Galia?
- Kilowog, we have to leave.

289
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:36,714
Galia!

290
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:56,767
I am disappointed in you, Gieta.
You have much to learn.

291
00:20:57,085 --> 00:21:00,854
No, my Queen.

292
00:21:00,922 --> 00:21:03,057
I have much to teach.
