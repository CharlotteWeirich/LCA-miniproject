It's up to us now.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,853
We have to return this egg.

7
00:00:23,932 --> 00:00:27,159
We have to keep it safe
and carry it to Xadia.

8
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,656
And find its mother.

9
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:32,457

[Viren] Though it is a heavy burden,

13
00:00:41,136 --> 00:00:45,423
I will humbly take up the battle

00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:54,401
Ugh. I don't think a boat...

18
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:55,805

This doesn't end well for you.

Last night, you thought
the cube was just a worthless toy.

It's a glow toy.

Exactly.

00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:23,905
I'm going to find some food.

00:03:23,992 --> 00:03:25,610
Wait, we've got food.

39
00:03:25,697 --> 00:03:28,841
We grabbed a sack of bread
at the Banther Lodge.

Yeah, I... I only saw her
do the first half.

60
00:05:33,872 --> 00:05:35,912
But I'm very good at the first half.

61
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:39,577
Seriously? That sounds
like a really good and safe idea.

62
00:05:39,664 --> 00:05:42,830
Okay, lecture well-deserved,
but what do I do now?

63
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:44,921
When you release a spell,
there's usually a word

64
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:47,715
or a phrase or something
in ancient draconic.

65
00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:51,798
Okay. Uh, anybody speak dragon?
I don't speak dragon.

66
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,175
- You didn't hear Claudia say anything?
- No.

67
00:05:54,262 --> 00:05:56,661
[stammers] I mean, I think
right when I grabbed her hand away,

68
00:05:56,728 --> 00:05:58,393
she might have called me a fool.

69
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,452
Yeah, fool seems about right.

70
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,356
Okay, give me a second.

71
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:06,916
I know some draconic words.
Just let me think.

72
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:11,322
Know what? I'm just gonna throw it.

73
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:12,777
What? No!

74
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:14,868
Yeah, I'm gonna
throw you the Primal Stone.

75
00:06:14,955 --> 00:06:16,989
- That's a good plan.
- [croaks]

76
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,826
No, that's not a good plan.
Throwing is bad.

77
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:22,500
I won't throw it.
I'll just gently toss it.

78
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:25,768
No, no, no! No throwing. No tossing.

79
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:28,479
Tossing it.

80
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:34,652
Ha! Ah! It worked. I'm okay.

81
00:06:37,388 --> 00:06:40,351
You're kind of making a sizzling sound.

82
00:06:40,438 --> 00:06:41,597
[croaks]

83
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:43,224
[Callum sighs] Sorry about that.

84
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:45,523
I guess I'm just so excited
to be learning magic,

85
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,145
and I got a little carried away.

86
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:50,523
Okay, enough almost-killing me.

87
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,407
The sooner we return this egg,
the sooner, maybe, this war can end.

88
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:56,257
It's time to hit the road.

89
00:06:56,658 --> 00:07:00,366
Road? Why wear ourselves out
walking on a road

90
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,139
when we can let the river do the walking?

91
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:07,582
Nope. Say goodbye to the boat.
We go by land from here.

92
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:10,251
But why?
The river's going the right direction,

93
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:12,926
and moves much faster
than we ever could on foot.

94
00:07:13,013 --> 00:07:14,775
I mean, look at those legs.

95
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:17,778
What? I have nice legs.

96
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:20,489
We're walking. That's final.

97
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:27,315
Is there maybe another reason
you don't wanna take the boat?

98
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:29,248
Something you're not telling us?

99
00:07:29,357 --> 00:07:31,584
No. There's no secret reason.

100
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:33,753
So, wait. [chuckles]

101
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:36,366
Are you, like, this back-flippin',

102
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:40,281
tree-climbin',
sword-stabbin' elven warrior,

103
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:43,429
but scared of a little splish-splashin'?

104
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:44,914
[inhales]

105
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:47,516
Aw, that's cute.

106
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:50,186
Fine, we'll take the stupid boat.

107
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:55,363
[Gren interpreting]
How could you let it come to this?

108
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,778
You speak as if I invited these assassins.

109
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:02,156
I had to leave our stronghold
at the Breach.

110
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,433
Do you have any idea the dangerous forces
gathered at our border?

111
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,400
I did everything in my power
to protect King Harrow.

112
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:12,485
I was willing to give my own life.

113
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:14,815
- Then what went wrong?
- He did.

114
00:08:14,902 --> 00:08:18,116
His own stubborn ways
stopped me from helping him.

115
00:08:18,203 --> 00:08:20,076
You know him as well as I do.

116
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:23,594
His pride was more important to him
than his life!

117
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,623
You wanted this outcome.

118
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,890
How dare you suggest...

119
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:30,503
His death creates opportunity for you.

120
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,917
His death breaks my heart.

121
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:35,920
Then honor him. Find his children.

122
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:39,429
They're gone, Amaya.
Captured by a Moonshadow elf.

123
00:08:39,516 --> 00:08:42,905
If they're not already dead,
they will be soon.

124
00:08:42,992 --> 00:08:45,658
This is a time of crisis.

125
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:52,832
An empty throne is a beacon of weakness,
an invitation to destroy us.

126
00:08:54,942 --> 00:08:57,942
[sighs] We must defend Katolis

127
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:01,632
and all of the human kingdoms
against what's coming.

128
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:04,969
I can help us from there.

129
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:08,619
You think I am being an opportunist.

130
00:09:08,706 --> 00:09:11,878
But I couldn't be more selfless
in my motivation.

131
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:16,313
I am a servant of Katolis. I am a servant!

132
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:21,026
Those are awfully nice clothes
for a humble servant, Viren.

133
00:09:22,303 --> 00:09:24,446
You don't believe me.

134
00:09:24,722 --> 00:09:28,222
Then you take it. Go ahead, sit down.

135
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:30,911
I'll support you as queen regent.

136
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,523
I'll gather the High Council,

137
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,709
and we'll send word to the other crowns
of the Pentarchy immediately.

138
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,672
The throne stays empty
until we find the boys.

139
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,300
[sighs, grunts]

140
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:58,689
Bait, you know
you're not supposed to do that.

141
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,010
- No playing in the water.
- [croaks]

142
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:04,528
Bait loves the water,
but he should be afraid of it.

143
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:05,993
You wanna know why he's named Bait?

144
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,928
[groans] Not really.

145
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:11,145
Well, I'm gonna tell you anyway.
It's kind of a sick joke, I guess.

146
00:10:11,232 --> 00:10:15,789
Glow toads?
They're apparently... delicious.

147
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:17,774
Gross.

148
00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:21,155
Deep-sea fishermen use them
to catch giant fish, stuff like that.

149
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:24,173
That's why he's named "Bait."
[chuckles] Get it?

150
00:10:24,532 --> 00:10:26,364
That's my stepdad's sense of humor.

151
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:28,266
But, yeah, that's why
we have to be extra careful

152
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,684
about him not getting in the water.

153
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:33,543
Guys, he doesn't know
how delicious he is, so shh.

154
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,768
[croaks suspiciously]

155
00:10:35,877 --> 00:10:38,771
And that's how the noodle got its name.

156
00:11:27,845 --> 00:11:30,030
[horse whinnies]

157
00:11:39,273 --> 00:11:42,292
May I light a candle?

158
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:56,181
You doing all right?

159
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,211
I'm doing great. [groans]

160
00:11:58,298 --> 00:12:00,875
I just love boats so much.

161
00:12:00,962 --> 00:12:03,961
That's why I'm down here. [gags]

162
00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:06,108
To be close to the boat.

163
00:12:07,802 --> 00:12:10,571
Tell you what.
I'm gonna ask you five questions.

164
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,635
Please don't.

165
00:12:11,722 --> 00:12:15,409
Come on! It'll be a fun distraction,
help take your mind off things.

166
00:12:15,496 --> 00:12:18,522
[sighs] Five questions,
that's all you get.

167
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:20,436
Okay, question one.

168
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:23,569
We always heard all these crazy things
about Xadia.

169
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:27,651
Like, it was this place
with just... magic everywhere.

170
00:12:27,738 --> 00:12:29,840
Is that really what it's like?

171
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,573
Yes. Next question.

172
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,286
It must be so weird
that everywhere you look there's magic.

173
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:41,498
It's not weird. In Xadia,
magic is pretty much in everything.

174
00:12:41,585 --> 00:12:45,299
It's no different from saying,
"Everywhere you look, there's nature."

175
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:49,595
It's just part of the vibrance
or spirit of things, you know?

176
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:53,030
I can't wait to see that.
It sounds incredible.

177
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:55,846
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

178
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:58,660
See, it's working, right?
Don't you feel a little better?

179
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:01,357
Maybe so. Ask your next question.

180
00:13:01,444 --> 00:13:04,104
Okay, question two.

181
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:06,043
What are your parents like?

182
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:08,754
- They're dead.
- Oh.

183
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,048
Rayla, I didn't mean to...

184
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,492
It's fine.

185
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:18,369
So, this might not be the best time
to bring this up,

186
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:20,955
but are you sure
you're not scared of the water?

187
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:22,253
I'm done with questions.

188
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,687
[stammering] I know, it's just...
the water's about to... Look!

189
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:29,713
Pull the boat over!

190
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,928
I don't think there's time.

191
00:13:31,015 --> 00:13:32,132
Pull it over!

192
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:33,723
I admit it, I hate the water.

193
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:37,407
I'm afraid of it. It makes me sick.
All of the bad feelings.

194
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:40,702
It's too late, hang on!

195
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,541
[Rayla screaming]

196
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:50,109
[Callum] Hold tight!

197
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,755
[Ezran laughing]

198
00:13:58,454 --> 00:14:00,973
[Viren] Your sister made him better.

199
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,832
Harrow told me
he was never as strong or brave

200
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,922
as Queen Sarai believed him to be,

201
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:10,504
but he tried every day
to be stronger and braver

202
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:13,569
so he could live up
to what she saw in him.

203
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,323
She was compassionate and patient.

204
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,994
Unless, of course,
you took the last jelly tart.

205
00:14:22,081 --> 00:14:23,104
[laughs]

206
00:14:23,854 --> 00:14:26,484
I only made that mistake once.

207
00:14:26,571 --> 00:14:28,458
[both laughing]

208
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,962
A sweet tooth and an iron fist.

209
00:14:32,613 --> 00:14:36,967
General Amaya, I am sorry
for what happened in the throne room.

210
00:14:37,118 --> 00:14:39,386
You helped me see the truth.

211
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:42,431
[Gren interpreting]
And why was that so hard?

212
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:48,729
I was blinded by my abiding love
of our kingdom and humanity itself.

213
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:53,088
Guard, fetch a stable boy, quickly.

214
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:56,528
I've encountered a giant pile of bull...

215
00:14:57,471 --> 00:14:58,472
droppings.

216
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,724
[chuckles]

217
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,930
The princes come first.

218
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:04,855
Finding them
is absolutely the top priority

219
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:08,207
- of the kingdom of Katolis.
- [Gren] Good.

220
00:15:08,294 --> 00:15:10,125
You see it my way.

221
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,004
I'll be departing at sundown
with a rescue party.

222
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:16,784
Of course. But allow me to ask...

223
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:18,842
what happens to the Breach?

224
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:22,534
You said yourself
how precarious the situation is.

225
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,209
Without you there commanding the fortress,

226
00:15:25,296 --> 00:15:28,894
do you believe, in your heart,
that the border will hold?

227
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,355
Make your point.

228
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:34,927
If the Breach falls,
the enemy will surge into Katolis,

229
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:40,113
and I can hardly imagine the death
and destruction that will follow.

230
00:15:40,514 --> 00:15:42,226
Then what are you suggesting?

231
00:15:42,313 --> 00:15:46,642
You return to the border, hold it fast.
It's where you're needed most.

232
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:49,525
A party of our best
will be dispatched immediately

233
00:15:49,612 --> 00:15:51,068
to find the princes.

234
00:15:51,155 --> 00:15:54,920
And in case you still doubt my intentions,

235
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:58,529
I will task my own children,
Soren and Claudia,

236
00:15:58,616 --> 00:16:01,009
with leading the rescue expedition.

237
00:16:01,096 --> 00:16:03,845
I do doubt your intentions.

238
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,558
I will return to the Breach,
but your children won't lead the rescue.

239
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:11,061
The mission will be assigned to...

240
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,563
Commander Gren.

241
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:17,567
That's... that's me. I am Commander Gren.

242
00:16:21,138 --> 00:16:23,490
[Callum and Ezran laughing]

243
00:16:27,144 --> 00:16:30,441
You faced your fear.
Do you feel better about water now?

244
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:33,313
I have never felt worse about water.

245
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,988
Hmm. Well, anyway,
we're making great time.

246
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:40,007
Hey, guys? Does anyone else see Bait?

247
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:44,553
- [Bait croaks]
- [gasps]

248
00:16:50,251 --> 00:16:54,048
Bait! Come back here!
Do your froggy paddle.

249
00:16:54,135 --> 00:16:55,814
[croaking softly]

250
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,615
You know you're not supposed to
get in the water.

251
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,222
What a disaster.

252
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:11,899
I know, right? My socks are all soggy.
A disaster!

253
00:17:11,986 --> 00:17:14,124
A soggy disaster!

254
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,086
- Uh, Callum...
- [Ocean Rune pulsating]

255
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:28,055
Hey, Ocean Rune.
I've never seen it light up before.

256
00:17:30,124 --> 00:17:32,559
Wait, why would the Ocean Rune be...

257
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:37,633
[all screaming]

258
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,358
[Callum] Oh, I get it!

259
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:45,677
[grunts]

260
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,182
[roars]

261
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,871
Ah, sweet, solid land, we meet again.

262
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,459
[Callum gasps]

263
00:17:58,611 --> 00:17:59,695
[croaks]

264
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:06,328
- Guys, behind you! Bait is in trouble!
- [Ezran] What?

265
00:18:06,415 --> 00:18:08,408
Bait needs help!

266
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:09,790
Bait sneezed kelp?

267
00:18:09,877 --> 00:18:13,497
No. She says, "Bait's knees smell."

268
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:14,879
Well, that's just mean.

269
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:15,966
No!

270
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:18,422
[croaks]

271
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,930
It's down to me, isn't it?

272
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:27,239
Of course it is.

273
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:31,576
Goodbye, sweet, solid land.
I barely knew you.

274
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,112
Come on, Rayla, do it for the frog.

275
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:42,671
The grumpy frog that hates you.

276
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:43,989
Here goes.

277
00:18:49,203 --> 00:18:50,621
[croaking]

278
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,626
[exclaims]

279
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,530
I have an idea. Rayla, jump!

280
00:19:28,617 --> 00:19:30,772
- But you don't know how to...
- Just jump!

281
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,542
[roars]

282
00:19:40,504 --> 00:19:41,505
[cheers]

283
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:58,163
I've sent word to Corvus
that King Harrow has passed.

284
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:02,167
Is Lord Viren aware
that Corvus has been tracking the princes?

285
00:20:02,526 --> 00:20:03,736
No.

286
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:06,109
Do not trust Viren.

287
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:09,159
It may be a month from now,
it may be a year,

288
00:20:09,246 --> 00:20:12,219
but he will stab you in the back.

289
00:20:13,537 --> 00:20:15,096
I'll be careful.

290
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:41,108
I expect to be notified
when the princes are found. And safe.

291
00:20:41,195 --> 00:20:42,195
Of course.

292
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:47,003
I'll send word to the Breach immediately.

293
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:53,991
Oh, Gren, bad news.

294
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:55,951
There's been a change of plans.

295
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:59,084
What are you talking about?
What is he talking about?

296
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:03,714
Oh, I've decided you're off the mission.
Soren will lead the rescue expedition.

297
00:21:03,801 --> 00:21:08,302
What? General Amaya was very specific
that I was to lead this.

298
00:21:08,389 --> 00:21:11,341
Oh, perhaps there was a misunderstanding?

299
00:21:11,428 --> 00:21:14,433
Soren, set up a meeting
for Commander Gren and I

300
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,784
to discuss his concerns.

301
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:19,563
Somewhere quiet.

302
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,080
Say, around 9:00?

303
00:21:22,523 --> 00:21:26,585
Yes, very good. 9:00 suits my schedule.

304
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:27,778
Very good.

305
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:37,429
Rayla, you saved Bait!
Without you, he would have been...

306
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,724
- fish food.
- [groans]

307
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,211
That was brave, Rayla.

308
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:45,167
No, I already told you,
I'm afraid of water.

309
00:21:45,254 --> 00:21:48,008
I know. That's why doing what you did
was so heroic.

310
00:21:48,095 --> 00:21:49,671
Oh, thanks.

311
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:52,346
Why wouldn't you just tell us
about your fear before?

312
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:54,863
It's okay to be afraid of things.

313
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,307
I guess I was afraid of being afraid.

314
00:22:00,394 --> 00:22:01,939
Well, that's kind of circular.

315
00:22:02,026 --> 00:22:07,208
But, hey, worth noting: you're not afraid
of being afraid of being afraid.

316
00:22:07,317 --> 00:22:08,487
That's deep.

317
00:22:08,574 --> 00:22:10,211
But stupid.

318
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,160
The thing is, Moonshadow elves
aren't supposed to show fear. Ever.

319
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:16,453
That's sad.

320
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,428
It's our way.

321
00:22:18,996 --> 00:22:22,913
My parents aren't really dead,
but I wish they were.

322
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,169
They're cowards.

323
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,624
What do you mean?

324
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:29,419
My parents were part of an elite force,
the Dragon Guard,

325
00:22:29,506 --> 00:22:33,762
eight elven warriors chosen to protect
the egg of the Dragon Prince.

326
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:37,474
Storm dragons only lay an egg
every thousand years.

327
00:22:37,561 --> 00:22:40,784
So that egg is so rare and precious.

328
00:22:41,268 --> 00:22:43,939
But when the humans came
and killed the Dragon King,

329
00:22:44,026 --> 00:22:48,569
the Dragon Guard, my parents,
failed in their duty.

330
00:22:48,656 --> 00:22:52,504
They ran away. I'm so ashamed.

331
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,216
Rayla, I'm so sorry for what humans did.

332
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:59,162
So, you see, that's why
I have to make things right.

333
00:22:59,249 --> 00:23:02,332
When I first came here,
I was on a quest for revenge.

334
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:05,836
But the moment I saw that egg,
everything changed.

335
00:23:05,923 --> 00:23:08,478
Now, this is a journey of redemption.

336
00:23:09,212 --> 00:23:11,383
- We're in this together.
- [croaks]

337
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,801
[water splashing]

338
00:23:12,888 --> 00:23:14,089
Oh, no.

339
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,597
Our boat seems to be drifting away.

340
00:23:16,684 --> 00:23:20,949
It slipped just out of my reach.
What will we do now?

341
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:29,874
- [sighs] Goodbye, boat.
- Thank you.

342
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:34,281
So, what's the deal
with your wrist ribbon thing?

343
00:23:34,368 --> 00:23:35,616
Does it mean something?

344
00:23:35,703 --> 00:23:37,074
Oh, uh...

345
00:23:37,658 --> 00:23:40,078
Nah. It's just decorative.

346
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:41,199
Decorative?

347
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:44,625
Yeah. Moonshadow elf thing, I guess.

348
00:23:44,712 --> 00:23:46,708
Mmm. Okay.

349
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:59,571
[sighs] Five past 9:00.
I apologize for my tardiness.

350
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,573
It was only five minutes.

351
00:24:01,932 --> 00:24:04,347
So, what are your concerns?

352
00:24:04,434 --> 00:24:05,682
Well... [clears throat]

353
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:07,189
You took me off the mission.

354
00:24:07,276 --> 00:24:09,811
Hmm, noted. Go on.

355
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:13,793
And you threw me in this dungeon.

356
00:24:13,944 --> 00:24:17,527
Ah, I see. Anything else?

357
00:24:17,614 --> 00:24:21,536
Uh, no. But... No.
I guess those are the main two.

358
00:24:21,623 --> 00:24:24,498
Thank you. Your feedback is a gift.

359
00:24:24,585 --> 00:24:28,224
Father, it's about our other prisoner...

360
00:24:32,876 --> 00:24:35,228
He's still refusing to eat.

361
00:24:35,924 --> 00:24:40,361
[sighs] Then let him be hungry.

362
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:50,616
