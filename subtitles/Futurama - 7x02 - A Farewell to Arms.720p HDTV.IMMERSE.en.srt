<i>Oh, my hair!</i>

5
00:00:32,596 --> 00:00:33,995
Lot of weather we're having.

6
00:00:34,029 --> 00:00:35,829
Allow me, m'lady.

7
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:40,131
Shall we go a-trousering?

8
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,631
Fry, I appreciate the gallantry,
but isn't this a bit much?

9
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:46,572
You're right. I'm sorry
for showing my love.

10
00:00:46,607 --> 00:00:49,310
Okay. Fine.

11
00:00:49,344 --> 00:00:51,249
Here, take my hand.

12
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,098
News and weather, everyone!

13
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,733
I'm sure you've all noticed

14
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,568
the bizarre atmospheric
conditions of late.

15
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,370
Come to mention it, yes.

16
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,172
It seems something ain't
right in the magnetosphere,

17
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:17,908
so I'm launching this
high-altitude weather balloon

18
00:01:17,942 --> 00:01:20,443
to gather more data.

19
00:01:23,046 --> 00:01:24,880
My pants!
My lucky pants!

20
00:01:24,914 --> 00:01:27,115
They don't look so lucky to me.

21
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:29,117
They are, too!

22
00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:31,085
I was wearing them that time
I found a dime in my ear.

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,457
I was wearing them when I
won a subscription to Redbook.

24
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:35,627
And I was wearing them
when I first met Leela,

25
00:01:35,661 --> 00:01:37,696
so yeah, they're lucky.

26
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,368
Aw...
also, oh, Lord.

27
00:01:40,402 --> 00:01:42,037
Plus, they're my only pants.

28
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:44,739
You've worn the same
pants for a thousand years?

29
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:46,375
No wonder they made a run for it.

30
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:02,996
Soon your trousers will
slip the surly bonds of Earth

31
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,332
and ascend to the heavens.

32
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:07,802
I'm gonna blast that balloon!

33
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:11,006
No way will I let
God get my pants!

34
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,242
Nobody messes with my pants!

35
00:02:13,276 --> 00:02:16,211
Not even the holy one, blessed be he.

36
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:36,199
Look out!
A Central Park badger!

37
00:02:40,504 --> 00:02:41,805
I'll save you, pants!

38
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:43,540
Scruffy, do you have any varmint grease?

39
00:02:43,575 --> 00:02:45,276
What viscosity you need?

40
00:02:55,056 --> 00:02:57,457
Whoa, there's writing in here!

41
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,396
Also, this grease is flammable.

42
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:13,140
Incredible! Who could have
done this, the sewer mutants?

43
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:14,842
No, this isn't Mutant language.

44
00:03:14,876 --> 00:03:18,745
We use a lot more profanity.
Son of a bitch...!

45
00:03:20,281 --> 00:03:22,315
Leela, take my hand!

46
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,319
I'm slipping!

47
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:28,422
The one time your hands
aren't sticky, they're greasy!

48
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:31,392
Oh, sorry. Normally I would've
wiped them on my pants, but...

49
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:38,266
Are you okay?

50
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,871
I... ow!
My leg, it's broken.

51
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:43,539
How'd you get down here?

52
00:03:43,574 --> 00:03:45,692
We made a rope from my shirt and jacket

53
00:03:45,785 --> 00:03:48,345
and an expedition flag
from my underpants.

54
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:50,948
I'll help you up.
Here, take my hand.

55
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:52,717
Stop telling me to take your hand.

56
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:55,620
Look, Fry, your noble gestures
keep making things worse.

57
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:59,024
Can't you just be a rude,
unhelpful jerk like Bender?

58
00:03:59,058 --> 00:04:02,394
When I use up the toilet paper,
I don't put on a new roll.

59
00:04:02,428 --> 00:04:05,263
Fry, my friend, I found your pants.

60
00:04:05,298 --> 00:04:08,299
And no sign of that crafty badger.

61
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:09,934
All right! Lucky pants!

62
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:19,877
Oh, my God! Look what
my flashlight found!

63
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,247
A huge pyramid under New New York?

64
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:26,083
What badger could've built this?

65
00:04:26,117 --> 00:04:29,086
And look at this
intricately carved disk.

66
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:31,289
It merits years of study.

67
00:04:31,324 --> 00:04:34,826
But how can we move such
a fragile, precious...

68
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,931
Ancient history coming through!

69
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:41,401
No, no, no, no, no!

70
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,805
Amazing!

71
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:48,742
It appears to be some kind
of extremely ancient calendar,

72
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:52,078
predating even
the "Girls of Sumeria."

73
00:04:52,113 --> 00:04:54,848
Of course.
It's a Mayan calendar.

74
00:04:54,883 --> 00:04:58,586
No, wait. There's some
dried-up old stew on the screen.

75
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,755
Sorry. I was eatin' a can of
breakfast and lookin' at porn.

76
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:07,428
It's not Mayan, it's Martian!

77
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:09,430
Amy, you grew up on Mars, right?

78
00:05:09,464 --> 00:05:11,532
- Can you read Martian?
- A little.

79
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:15,203
I only learned enough to
yell at my nanny. Let's see.

80
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:20,541
I think it means...
"The sun will erupt...

81
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:23,044
all shall perish,"
blah-blah-blah.

82
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:26,514
Get to the point!
What does it say about me, Bender?

83
00:05:26,549 --> 00:05:28,550
Nothing! But it does say

84
00:05:28,584 --> 00:05:31,319
a great cataclysm will destroy
the world in the year 3012!

85
00:05:31,353 --> 00:05:34,689
The world?
That's where I live!

86
00:05:34,723 --> 00:05:36,691
Told you it'd say something about me.

87
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:39,293
So the world will end in 3012.

88
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:41,361
Why does that year sound so familiar?!

89
00:05:41,396 --> 00:05:45,032
Because that's the year
that's this year! See?

90
00:05:52,741 --> 00:05:55,309
So, uh, you all done with the computer?

91
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:04,165
Is it just me, or is the world
ending more often these days?

92
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,268
The calendar predicts
fires, earthquakes,

93
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:10,204
sharksplosions, then it just ends!

94
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:13,007
Exactly as the weather balloon foretold.

95
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:15,376
Before Fry blew his
pants out of the sky,

96
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:20,147
it detected the onset of
a catastrophic sunspot cycle.

97
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:30,189
It's starting.
This is the end of the world.

98
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,294
Coward Man away!

99
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:44,136
Some of us were crazy
before it was cool.

100
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:51,177
Evacuating the planet in three, two...

101
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:54,147
So long, Earth. Thanks for nothing.

102
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:57,717
It's not starting.

103
00:06:59,187 --> 00:07:01,921
Come ons, comes on!

104
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:08,427
Let me try,
Headless Clone of Agnew.

105
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,397
Damn thing just won't turn over.

106
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:14,499
It's like Pat on a Sunday morning.

107
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:18,503
Oh, the Marconi is on the fritz, too!

108
00:07:18,537 --> 00:07:23,841
The electromagnetic storm is
disabling all electronics on Earth.

109
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:27,511
Hi, there.

110
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:32,916
Well, it wasn't a bad life.

111
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:36,352
If only I could get back that time
I spent watching TRON: Legacy.

112
00:07:36,386 --> 00:07:38,288
Leela, I've made up my mind.

113
00:07:38,322 --> 00:07:40,757
Before we die, I'm
gonna find and destroy

114
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:43,427
every remaining copy of TRON: Legacy.

115
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:45,295
It may take a couple of hours, but...

116
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,198
Fry, stop trying to do things for me.

117
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:51,635
Whatever time we have
left, just live it with me.

118
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:55,473
So... you wanna
join the Balcony Club?

119
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:59,144
The Balcony Club?
I have an individual membership.

120
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:03,782
- Zoidberg, get lost.
- I am lost. So long.

121
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,789
Stop the end-of-the-world sex.
We might survive after all.

122
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:16,928
All right, Amy, what's so important
that you interrupted my embalming?

123
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:21,232
I translated more Martian symbols.
There's a way off this planet.

124
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:24,302
That underground pyramid
isn't a pyramid...

125
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,671
<i>it's a rocket ship!</i>

126
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:30,776
It was worth waiting five hours
to hear you finish that sentence.

127
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:35,782
A spaceship made of stone?
With no electronics, it just might work!

128
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:38,518
I'll stick with wind-up
power, thank you very much.

129
00:08:38,553 --> 00:08:41,020
Hmm, I've never flown a pyramid before,

130
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:43,956
but I used to drive
around town in a mausoleum.

131
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,524
How many people can this thing carry?

132
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:49,924
Well, the mausoleum
held ten horny teenagers, so...

133
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:51,430
maybe 30,000.

134
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:55,667
It's our moral duty
to save as many lives as possible.

135
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,272
They had their chance.
Let's go!

136
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,574
Mind if I appear?

137
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,318
Welcome to the Hidey House.

138
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:14,822
Brannigan, tell me about this
freaky-deaky escape pyramid.

139
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:18,493
I can fly it, sir.
I just need to know where, and how.

140
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:20,395
The obvious destination is Mars.

141
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:24,299
It's close, with lots of open space
and no Woodward or Bernstein.

142
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,633
That's a plus.

143
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:29,971
But we can only save 30,000 people.
How do we choose who goes?

144
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:32,974
Well, let's see now.
We'll need leaders...

145
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,713
...scientists, doctors,
bureaucrats, pilots,

146
00:09:38,747 --> 00:09:41,750
valuable appliances...
even janitors.

147
00:09:41,784 --> 00:09:44,419
But that's it.
No one else.

148
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:47,222
I'll miss you, Leela.

149
00:09:47,256 --> 00:09:49,991
But it's okay, 'cause then I'll die.

150
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:51,425
Cut the waterworks, hippie!

151
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,528
The final decision
will be made not by me,

152
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:57,031
but by a cold, logical machine.

153
00:09:57,065 --> 00:10:00,000
<i>Who shall live and who shall die?</i>

154
00:10:00,035 --> 00:10:03,203
<i>Step right up to the
contrabulous choose-matron!</i>

155
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:05,772
I hate waiting in line to die.

156
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:07,106
Move it along, grandma.

157
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:10,242
Stick your hand in

<i>Female, crotchety.
Needed to keep others in their place.</i>

<i>Accepted!</i>

160
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,582
Damn straight, kajigger!

161
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,117
Ooh, me next!

162
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,854
<i>We just got one of these. Rejected!</i>

163

- Sigma Beta, see you latah!

168

<i>Male, medical doctor,
delicious with butter and lemon.</i>

<i>Accepted!</i>

170
00:10:44,146 --> 00:10:45,613
I wish they'd hurry.

171
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:47,715
I want to get out of here
before the mayhem starts.

172
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:50,718
Mayhem?!
There's gonna be mayhem?

173
00:10:50,752 --> 00:10:52,786
I'm stayin'!
Hoo-ee!

174
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,521
Well, might as well
get it over with.

175
00:10:56,991 --> 00:11:00,159
<i>Delivery boy, no discernible skills.</i>

<i>'Cause I like his pants.</i>

178
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:05,633
Yes! My lucky pants!

179
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:08,336
Leela, we can go together
after all. Come on.

180
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,405
Get your badge.
Take my hand.

181
00:11:11,707 --> 00:11:14,009
<i>Top gun pilot, natural leader,</i>

182

<i>extreme combat training.
Rejected!</i>

183
00:11:16,446 --> 00:11:17,646
What?!

184
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:21,584
<i>With all spaceships inoperable,
we only need one spaceship pilot.</i>

185
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:25,355
Wonder what this doo-cracky does?

186
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,093
Snake door. Roger.

187
00:11:30,128 --> 00:11:34,365
You can't reject Leela!
Give her a badge, you stupid box!

188
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,867
<i>Male, filthy hand, violent temper.</i>

189
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:38,135
<i>Accepted again!</i>

190
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,438
Nooo!

191
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:45,343
Fry, the box has spoken.
Go to Mars.

192
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:48,379
Okay.

193
00:11:48,413 --> 00:11:50,114
Will you at least keep this photo?

194
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:54,885
Remember how Bender dumped
all that pig's blood on me?

195
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,956
You keep it.
I'll remember you in here. 

196
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,992
I wish I could remember
with my boobs.

197
00:12:04,562 --> 00:12:06,796
Leela, we're off to Mars.

198
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:09,966
We'll see ourselves out.

199
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:12,802
Wait, I did it.
I got Leela a ticket.

200
00:12:14,071 --> 00:12:15,572
How did you do that?

201
00:12:16,874 --> 00:12:20,376
A magician never reveals his secrets.
Except the Great Revealo.

202
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:21,811
That guy stinks.

203
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:41,865
I still don't see why
you get the window seat.

204
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,736
Folks, this is your captain.
Our snake tanks are fully loaded,

205
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,671
<i>so once I figure out which
button launches this...</i>

206
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,173
<i>I figured it out!</i>

207
00:13:06,257 --> 00:13:09,025
Boo!
Don't come back!

208
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,428
Well, let's get lootin'!

209
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:15,966
Fry, this is the most noble thing
anyone has ever done for me.

210
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,601
Wait, Fry?

211
00:13:17,635 --> 00:13:19,803
I'm a lot of people, but I'm not Fry.

212
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:24,875
Oh, no!

213
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:54,673
Welcome to Mars!
It is with heavy heart and open arms 

214
00:13:54,707 --> 00:13:57,142
that we receive Earth's only survivors.

215
00:13:57,177 --> 00:14:00,513
- Admission, $20.
- Dad! Gleesh.

216
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,048
Greetings, Mars men.

217
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,718
We come to your planet to
construct a gleaming city,

218
00:14:04,752 --> 00:14:07,554
a second Earth on which to begin anew.

219
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:09,390
Okay. Admission, $20.

220
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:13,060
I can't believe it.
Fry sacrificed his spot for me,

221
00:14:13,095 --> 00:14:15,496
and I never even had
a chance to thank him.

222
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:21,335
Don't worry, Leela. Earth is still
there, peaceful and serene as ever.

223
00:14:44,363 --> 00:14:45,860
Bender!
You're stealing your own stuff!

224
00:14:45,894 --> 00:14:48,729
I am?
Geez, I better slow down.

225
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:50,431
I'm stealing stuff I don't even need.

226
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:53,434
- You want a Torah?
- Nah, I'm not hungry.

227
00:14:53,469 --> 00:14:55,703
Aw, what's the matter?
Scared of dying?

228
00:14:55,738 --> 00:15:00,609
No. 'Cause as long as Leela lives,
I'll be alive, too, in her heart.

229
00:15:00,643 --> 00:15:02,710
But really I'll be dead.

230
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,986
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
our new Martian city is complete.</i>

231
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,156
<i>I give you...
Dickfrancisco!</i>

232
00:15:18,596 --> 00:15:21,999
The doves didn't magically
spring from my hand,

233
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:24,735
but rather were crammed into
this netting sewn into my sleeve!

234
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:28,073
Thank you, Great Revealo.

235
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:31,443
And now, as a solemn testicle
to those left behind on Earth,

236
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:35,547
I present this monument,
titled simply, "Heroes."

237
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:43,522
That frightened little girl in
the statue reminds me of Fry.

238
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:46,624
Stop the ceremony.

239
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:51,294
Who is this non-Washington redskin?

240
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:55,365
I am Singing Wind, chief
of the native Martian tribe.

241
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:57,634
But I thought your people
abandoned this planet.

242
00:15:57,668 --> 00:16:00,804
We did.
I just came back for my stuff.

243
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:03,940
- What're you guys doing here?
- Fleeing Earth, of course.

244
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:06,810
We flew here in your
great stone pyramid.

245
00:16:06,844 --> 00:16:08,845
Seriously? That thing flies?

246
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,382
Of course.
Your people left it so we could escape.

247
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:15,185
I translated your warning
that the world was doomed.

248
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,137
Not your world.
Our world.

249
00:16:18,258 --> 00:16:20,792
We put calendar there to
warn you not to visit Mars.

250
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:22,874
It Mars that gonna be destroyed.

251
00:16:24,598 --> 00:16:27,500
Why you think we so eager
to abandon this dump?

252
00:16:27,534 --> 00:16:32,705
You guys got ten, 15 minutes max.
Well, so long.

253
00:16:36,743 --> 00:16:39,811
Hey, Ancient Martian's
a very hard language.

254
00:16:39,846 --> 00:16:42,914
A........ looks just like a ......... .

255
00:16:47,052 --> 00:16:49,720
- To the spaceship!
- There is no spaceship.

256
00:16:49,754 --> 00:16:52,256
You had it dismantled
to build that statue.

257
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,657
To the statue.

258
00:16:57,396 --> 00:17:02,167
Oh, what an idiot I was.
And by "I", I mean "you."

259
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:06,938
The final solar flare is going
to bypass Earth and strike Mars.

260
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:28,725
My God, one of the hundreds of
contradictory prophecies is coming true.

261
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,962
I should've known better than to
trust one of Fry's romantic gestures.

262
00:17:31,996 --> 00:17:34,131
Every time he says he
loves me, I get killed.

263
00:17:36,935 --> 00:17:39,103
It's just as I only now began to fear.

264
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:42,740
The solar flares are igniting
subsurface gas pockets.

265
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:50,882
Mars is being blasted out of its orbit.

266
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:53,218
<i>Fry, you noble idiot.</i>

267
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:05,562
You're right, Bender,
grave robbing is fun.

268
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:08,064
And these Pinias Skulladas are fantastic.

269
00:18:08,098 --> 00:18:11,333
The crazy weather cleared
up, too, for whatever reason.

270
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:14,736
All in all, it's a fine
day for an apocalypse.

271
00:18:14,771 --> 00:18:16,772
So you don't miss
what's-her-name?

272
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:18,441
Of course I do.

273
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:20,843
But even though we're
millions of miles apart,

274
00:18:20,878 --> 00:18:23,613
somehow, I feel she's near me.

275
00:18:23,648 --> 00:18:24,915
Very near!

276
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:32,857
Oh no!
The Kajigger of Gibraltar!

277
00:18:44,237 --> 00:18:47,339
I have got to quit drinking.

278
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:49,475
Thanks, friend!

279
00:18:52,913 --> 00:18:57,283
Another great thing was
she always had room for dessert.

280
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:01,554
We're passing surprisingly
close to Earth!

281
00:19:01,588 --> 00:19:04,423
When we reach 72nd Street, jump!

282
00:19:11,097 --> 00:19:12,831
Ah. Cushiony.

283
00:19:14,434 --> 00:19:16,701
We made it. We're back home.

284
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:18,636
Okay, today is still a workday, so...

285
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,137
<i> Wait! Help!</i>

286
00:19:20,172 --> 00:19:23,039
<i>I'm still on Mars, and I can't jump!</i>

287
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:26,242
Hang on, Leela!
I'll save you again!

288
00:19:26,277 --> 00:19:28,311
Or somebody else could do it!

289
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:35,418
Quick, take my hand.

290
00:19:35,452 --> 00:19:38,488
I don't know.
Bad things happen when you say that.

291
00:19:45,463 --> 00:19:47,230
- I got her!
- Ow!

292
00:19:47,265 --> 00:19:51,368
- Oops. Try again!
- We're too far apart.

293
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:54,771
No, we're not. Grab your
severed arm with your other arm.

294
00:19:54,806 --> 00:19:57,908
Ew... kay...

295
00:19:57,942 --> 00:19:59,876
Hurray!

296
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:10,552
Good thing Scruffy rescued Leela.

297
00:20:10,587 --> 00:20:12,854
Don't thank me, thank the ladder.

298
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:16,291
Your cloned arms should be
fully grown in a month or so.

299
00:20:16,325 --> 00:20:17,960
But for right now,

300
00:20:17,994 --> 00:20:21,396
enjoy the sounds of the
world's smallest violin.

301
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:28,538
I hope you're not too mad at me,
Leela, for tearing your arm off and all.

302
00:20:28,572 --> 00:20:31,975
I can't be mad.
I'm on way too many painkillers.

303
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:36,247
Plus, you were willing to
sacrifice yourself so I could live.

304
00:20:36,281 --> 00:20:39,451
I mean, you failed,
miserably,

305
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:42,955
but you're the only person
who loves me enough to try.

306
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:45,324
One last foolish gesture?

307
00:20:46,426 --> 00:20:48,560
- Uh...
- Mm.

308
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:53,567
Mmm...

309
00:20:57,417 --> 00:21:00,246
