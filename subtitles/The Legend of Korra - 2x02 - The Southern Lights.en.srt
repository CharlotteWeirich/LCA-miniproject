Ah, perhaps you'd like
to re-center yourself

00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:37,341

I'm fine.

And you must be the honorable Pema.

Please, accept these gifts.

00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:46,717
This is an ancient air-bender head shaver

507
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:49,053
we've refurbished just for you.

Oh... okay.

509
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:56,026
And, Pema, these flowers
once filled the mountainside.

510
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:58,496
Now they can brighten up your room.

That's... sweet?

You didn't have to.

Nonsense.

Whatever you need is yours.

No! That gift is mine.

I'm gonna name him Poki.

Poki, come back!

Excuse me, a little help here.

00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:36,734
Sorry, I thought you were the servants.

We're Tenzin's brother and sister.

The world is filled with more air-benders?

We're not air-benders.

533
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:47,378
Oh. I'm so sorry.

534

I thought you said Bolin was coming.

535

He said he'd be here, but
I can't worry about it.

536
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:00,558
I have to make sure you
have everything you need

537
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,892
for a safe trip.

Thanks, captain expedition,

Tonraq, what do you want?

00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,740
I heard you're taking
Korra to the South Pole.

Absolutely not.

544
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:20,744
You're a distraction to Korra

545
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,680
and a hindrance to what needs to be done.

546

My daughter is not going without me.

547

She needs someone to watch after her.

Dad, why do you always think
you know what's best for me?

549
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:32,623
Because he's misguided.

550
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,825
The sad truth is it's men like your father

551
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:37,161
who have put the spirit
world out of balance.

He's ignored my warnings in the past

It doesn't matter.

What matters is the everstorm.

The everstorm?

558
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:50,341
It's a massive blizzard that's
battered the South Pole for decades.

I'm coming, unless you
think you can stop me.

He also gave me this fancy snowsuit.

It's inflatable with an internal heater,

So once we get to the South Pole,

00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,312
then what happens?

587
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:04,581
You will open an ancient spirit portal.

I'm sorry. What now?

589
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:08,719
At the South Pole, there is a portal

00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:11,321
that connects our world
to the spirit world.

But it has long been closed.

592

And that's why the evil
spirits are attacking?

593
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:17,428
There are no evil spirits. [Thunder]

There is light and dark in them all.

But when they're unbalanced,
the darkness takes over.

00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,503
If you can open the portal in time,

597
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:29,039

There's a reason the

ends on the winter solstice.

That's when the spirit world

602
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,749
and the physical world are close together.

603
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:42,319
Only then can the Avatar open the portal.

00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:31,601
- You never cease to amaze me.
- Thanks.

834
00:44:31,603 --> 00:44:34,771
By the way, I'm really
sorry for being a total pain.

835
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:36,906
Things were really stressful and confusing.

836
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:39,142
It's hard being the Avatar.

837
00:44:39,144 --> 00:44:40,910
It's harder being the Avatar's boyfriend.

838
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:43,079
[Laughs]

839
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:10,606
What are all your
northern troops doing here?

840
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:13,209
Opening the spirit portal
was only the first step

841
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:14,610
in getting the Southern Water Tribe

842
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:16,512
back on its righteous path.

843
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:18,948
There's more difficult work to be done

844
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:21,951
before our two tribes are truly united.
