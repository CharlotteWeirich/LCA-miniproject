<i>Air.</i>

00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:13,596
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:17,675
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:21,988
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,148
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:29,310
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:31,150
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:33,356
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:37,089
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,712
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

15
00:00:55,328 --> 00:01:00,730
I'm not one to complain, but can't Appa fly any higher?

16
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:06,584
I have an idea, why don't we all get on your back and you can fly us to the North Pole?

17
00:01:06,647 --> 00:01:13,152
I'd love to! Climb on everyone, Sokka's ready for takeoff!

18
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:16,398
Look, we're all just a little tired and cranky...

19
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,863
...because we've been flying for two days straight.

20
00:01:18,927 --> 00:01:22,190
And for what? We can't even find the Northern Water Tribe.

21
00:01:22,247 --> 00:01:24,927
There's nothing up here.

22
00:01:41,744 --> 00:01:45,839
They're waterbenders! We found the Water Tribe!

23
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,020
He's heading north. The Northern Water Tribe.

24
00:01:53,084 --> 00:01:57,987
The Avatar needs to master waterbending. He's looking for a teacher.

25
00:01:58,007 --> 00:02:00,872
Then what are we waiting for? Let's go get him!

26
00:02:00,935 --> 00:02:06,580
Patience, Captain Li. This isn't some little Earth village we can just march into.

27
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:08,884
The Water Tribe is a great nation.

28
00:02:08,937 --> 00:02:12,246
There's a reason they've survived a hundred years of war.

29
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:17,171
The frozen tundra is treacherous. The landscape itself is an icy fortress.

30
00:02:17,247 --> 00:02:21,458
We'll need a massive invasion force.

31
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:25,897
There it is!

32
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:28,783
The Northern Water Tribe...

33
00:02:28,843 --> 00:02:31,534
We're finally here...

34
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,222
I can't believe how many waterbenders live up here!

35
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:58,269
We'll find a master to teach us, no problem!

36
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:40,123
This place is beautiful.

37
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:43,164
Yeh, she is.

38
00:03:55,181 --> 00:04:06,107
♫ Winter, spring, summer and fall. Winter, spring, summer and fall. ♫

39
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:18,502
♫ Four seasons, four loves. Four seasons, four loves. ♫

40
00:04:39,183 --> 00:04:45,918
Tonight, we celebrate the arrival of our brother and sister from the Southern Tribe,...

41
00:04:45,973 --> 00:04:49,317
...and they have brought with them someone very special,...

42
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:54,963
...someone whom many of us believed disappeared from the world until now.

43
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:57,552
The Avatar!

44
00:05:00,284 --> 00:05:05,048
We also celebrate my daughter's 16th birthday.

45
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:09,522
Princess Yue is now of marrying age.

46
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:10,573
Thank you, father.

47
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:15,702
May the great Ocean and Moon Spirits watch over us during these troubled times.

48
00:05:15,754 --> 00:05:20,910
Now, Master Pakku and his students will perform!

49
00:05:40,195 --> 00:05:42,953
Hi, there. Sokka, Southern Water Tribe.

50
00:05:42,992 --> 00:05:45,814
Very nice to meet you.

51
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,789
So... uh... you're a Princess, huh?!

52
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:55,381
You know, back in my tribe, I'm kinda like a Prince myself!

53
00:05:55,435 --> 00:05:57,290
Ha! Prince of what?

54
00:05:57,345 --> 00:06:01,153
A lot of things! Uh, do you mind? I'm trying to have a conversation here!

55
00:06:01,204 --> 00:06:04,316
My apologies, Prince Sokka.

56
00:06:05,052 --> 00:06:07,941
So it looks like I'm gonna be in town for awhile.

57
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:12,105
I'm thinking maybe we could... do an activity together?

58
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:14,959
Do an "activity"?

59
00:06:18,784 --> 00:06:20,662
Very smooth.

60
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:25,352
Master Pakku, meet your newest student, the Avatar.

61
00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:31,655
Just because you're destined to save the world, don't expect any special treatment.

62
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:34,514
My friend and I can't wait to start training with you...

63
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:36,692
...after we relax for a couple days.

64
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,759
If you want to relax, then I suggest visiting a tropical island.

65
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:46,718
If not, I'll see you both at sunrise. Good night.

66
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,731
For the last time, I'm not playing the sumki horn.

67
00:06:53,783 --> 00:06:59,883
No, it's about our plans. There's a bit of a problem.

68
00:07:01,718 --> 00:07:02,967
I'm taking your crew.

69
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,092
What!?

70
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,679
I've recruited them for a little expedition to the North Pole.

71
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:09,390
Uncle, is that true?

72
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:14,634
I'm afraid so. He's taking everyone. Even the cook!

73
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:18,155
Sorry you won't be there to watch me capture the Avatar.

74
00:07:18,224 --> 00:07:22,987
But I can't have you getting in my way again.

75
00:07:39,954 --> 00:07:43,581
I didn't know you were skilled with broadswords, Prince Zuko.

76
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,912
I'm not. They're antiques. Just decorative.

77
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:51,197
Have you heard of the Blue Spirit, General Iroh?

78
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:54,734
Just rumors. I don't think he is real.

79
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:59,877
He's real all right. He's a criminal, an enemy of the Fire Nation.

80
00:07:59,923 --> 00:08:03,363
But I have a feeling that justice will catch up with him soon.

81
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:09,888
General Iroh, the offer to join my mission still stands if you change your mind.

82
00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:15,904
I've waited for this day my whole life!

83
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:21,022
I finally get to learn from a real waterbending master!

84
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:24,289
Good morning, Master Pakku!

85
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:28,417
No, please, march right in, I'm not concentrating or anything.

86
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:33,754
Uhh... this is my friend, Katara, the one I told you about?

87
00:08:33,797 --> 00:08:37,121
I'm sorry. I think there's been a misunderstanding.

88
00:08:37,203 --> 00:08:39,488
You didn't tell me your friend was a girl.

89
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:46,246
In our tribe, it is forbidden for women to learn waterbending.

90
00:08:52,036 --> 00:08:54,319
What do you mean you won't teach me?

91
00:08:54,355 --> 00:08:58,371
I didn't travel across the entire world so you could tell me "no"!

92
00:08:58,418 --> 00:08:59,319
No.

93
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:02,417
But there must be other female waterbenders in your tribe!

94
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:06,803
Here the women learn from Yugoda to use their waterbending to heal.

95
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:11,463
I'm sure she would be happy to take you as her student despite your bad attitude.

96
00:09:11,523 --> 00:09:13,587
I don't want to heal, I want to fight!

97
00:09:13,644 --> 00:09:17,902
I can see that. But our tribe has customs, rules.

98
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:19,553
Well your rules stink!

99
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:23,761
Yeh! They're not fair. If you won't teach Katara, then...

100
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:24,934
Then what?

101
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,969
Then I won't learn from you!

102
00:09:27,022 --> 00:09:30,942
Well have fun teaching yourself. I'm sure you'll do a great job.

103
00:09:30,994 --> 00:09:34,629
Wait! Aang didn't mean that.

104
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,855
You can't risk your training for me.

105
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:42,599
You have to learn from Master Pakku. Even if he is a big jerk.

106
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:47,537
Why don't we get started then?

107
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:52,898
Princess Yue! Good morning!

108
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:55,300
Hey, how about that picnic last night?

109
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:57,782
Boy, your Dad sure knows how to throw a party.

110
00:09:57,836 --> 00:09:59,861
I'm happy you enjoyed yourself.

111
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,872
Well, it wasn't as much fun after you left.

112
00:10:04,557 --> 00:10:07,536
So, I'm still hoping we can see more of each other.

113
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,749
Do an "activity", you mean?

114
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:13,729
Yes! At... a place! For... some time!

115
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:17,220
I'd love to! I'll meet you on that bridge tonight.

116
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,488
Great! I'll see you... aahh!

117
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:23,028
Sorry!

118
00:10:23,384 --> 00:10:27,819
That's okay, it was worth it. See you tonight.

119
00:10:28,488 --> 00:10:30,781
I'm very impressed.

120
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:36,366
You all seem highly qualified for the mission I have in mind.

121
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,382
That's some tasty gold!

122
00:10:40,434 --> 00:10:42,390
What do you need us to do?

123
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:46,600
I believe you're acquainted with Prince Zuko?

124
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:56,415
Um, hi. Are you Yugoda?

125
00:10:56,485 --> 00:11:00,234
Are you here for the healing lesson?

126
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:04,110
I guess I am.

127
00:11:04,186 --> 00:11:08,536
Welcome! Welcome!

128
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:17,938
You're moving the water around, but you're not feeling the push and pull.

129
00:11:17,987 --> 00:11:20,851
I'm trying!

130
00:11:22,617 --> 00:11:29,492
Maybe that move is too advanced for you. Why don't you try an easier one?

131
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:34,395
Thanks for the lesson.

132
00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:36,276
So, who's the lucky boy?

133
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:36,951
Huh?

134
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:40,936
Your betrothal necklace. You're getting married, right?

135
00:11:40,963 --> 00:11:44,370
Ah, no, I don't think I'm ready for that yet.

136
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,654
My grandmother gave my mother this necklace,...

137
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:49,643
...and my mother passed it down to me.

138
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:55,122
I recognize this carving! I don't know why I didn't realize sooner!

139
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,587
You're the spitting image of Kana!

140
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:00,727
Wait, how do you know my Gran Gran's name?

141
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:05,015
When I was about your age I was friends with Kana.

142
00:12:05,054 --> 00:12:08,155
She was born here, in the Northern Tribe.

143
00:12:08,198 --> 00:12:09,863
She never told me.

144
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:13,778
Your grandmother had an arranged marriage with a young waterbender.

145
00:12:13,826 --> 00:12:16,153
He carved that necklace for her.

146
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,362
If Gran Gran was engaged, why did she leave?

147
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:26,645
I don't know. That's always been a mystery to me. She left without saying goodbye.

148
00:12:26,665 --> 00:12:28,992
Good luck!

149
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,229
The crew wanted me to wish you safe travels.

150
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,278
Good riddance to those traitors.

151
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:39,095
It's a lovely night for a walk. Why don't you join me?

152
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:42,347
It would clear your head.

153
00:12:43,425 --> 00:12:47,310
Or, just stay in your room and sit in the dark.

154
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:51,425
Whatever makes you happy.

155
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,454
Careful with the blasting jelly!

156
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:28,361
Uncle? Uncle, is that you?

157
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:11,763
Zuko!

158
00:14:19,104 --> 00:14:21,773
Zuko...

159
00:14:31,634 --> 00:14:37,341
Hi, Princess Yue. I made you something. I carved it myself.

160
00:14:37,403 --> 00:14:38,475
It's a bear.

161
00:14:38,523 --> 00:14:43,664
Actually, it's suppose to be a fish, see it has a fin.

162
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:52,452
Oh. I'm sorry! I made a mistake. I shouldn't have asked you to come here!

163
00:14:58,557 --> 00:15:02,038
How's warrior training going?

164
00:15:02,071 --> 00:15:03,099
That bad?

165
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:05,952
No, it's Princess Yue. I don't get it.

166
00:15:05,998 --> 00:15:10,080
One minute she wants to go out with me and the next she's telling me to get lost!

167
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:12,385
So how's waterbending training?

168
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:16,436
Master Poophead won't teach her because she's a girl.

169
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,902
Why don't you just teach her, Aang?

170
00:15:18,962 --> 00:15:21,111
Why didn't I think of that?

171
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:24,682
At night, you can teach me whatever moves you learned from Master Pakku.

172
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:28,210
That way you have someone to practice with and I get to learn waterbending.

173
00:15:28,257 --> 00:15:29,777
Everyone's happy!

174
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,292
I'm not happy.

175
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:34,946
But you're never happy. Come on, Aang!

176
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:45,021
Master Pakku said this move is all about sinking and floating.

177
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:48,249
I got it!

178
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:49,902
That was amazing!

179
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:52,961
That wasn't me.

180
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:55,548
I... I was just showing Katara a few moves.

181
00:15:55,595 --> 00:16:00,033
You have disrespected me, my teachings, and my entire culture.

182
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:01,148
I'm sorry, I...

183
00:16:01,205 --> 00:16:05,945
You are no longer welcome as my student.

184
00:16:11,147 --> 00:16:16,710
What do you want me to do? Force Master Pakku to take Aang back as his student?

185
00:16:16,771 --> 00:16:18,690
Yes... please!

186
00:16:18,742 --> 00:16:27,699
I suspect he might change his mind if you swallow your pride and apologize to him.

187
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:30,565
Fine.

188
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:33,405
I'm waiting, little girl.

189
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:39,715
No! No way am I apologizing to a sour old man like you!

190
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,054
Uh, Katara...

191
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,864
I'll be outside... if you're man enough to fight me!

192
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:49,858
I'm sure she didn't mean that.

193
00:16:49,923 --> 00:16:52,805
Yeh, I think she did.

194
00:16:53,482 --> 00:16:59,648
I'm devastated to hear about Prince Zuko. Just devastated.

195
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:04,590
The Fire Lord will not be pleased when he learns who was responsible.

196
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:07,400
You know who... was behind the attack?

197
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:13,411
Yes... pirates! We had a run in with them awhile back.

198
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:16,242
They wanted revenge.

199
00:17:17,144 --> 00:17:20,335
So, have you reconsidered my offer?

200
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:28,172
Yes, I accept. It will be an honor to serve as your general. To the Fire Nation!

201
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:30,306
To victory!

202
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,340
Are you crazy, Katara? You're not gonna win this fight!

203
00:17:36,384 --> 00:17:38,164
I know! I don't care!

204
00:17:38,227 --> 00:17:41,542
You don't have to do this for me. I can find another teacher.

205
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:46,880
I'm not doing it for you! Someone needs to slap some sense into that guy!

206
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:50,645
So, you decided to show up?

207
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,621
Aren't you gonna fight?

208
00:17:53,696 --> 00:17:58,773
Go back to the healing huts with the other women where you belong.

209
00:18:01,537 --> 00:18:07,511
Fine. You want to learn to fight so bad, study closely!

210
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:19,533
Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you!

211
00:18:37,297 --> 00:18:39,416
You can't knock me down!

212
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,406
Go Katara!

213
00:19:22,123 --> 00:19:26,681
Well, I'm impressed. You are an excellent waterbender.

214
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:28,961
But you still won't teach me, will you?

215
00:19:29,021 --> 00:19:30,994
No.

216
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:56,664
This fight is over.

217
00:19:56,704 --> 00:19:58,914
Come back here! I'm not finished yet!

218
00:19:58,968 --> 00:20:02,128
Yes, you are.

219
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:05,952
This is my necklace!

220
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:08,634
No it's not, it's mine! Give it back!

221
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:15,483
I made this sixty years ago... for the love of my life. For Kana.

222
00:20:15,553 --> 00:20:19,825
My Gran Gran was supposed to marry you?

223
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:29,794
Our plan is working perfectly. Zhao doesn't suspect a thing.

224
00:20:29,857 --> 00:20:31,350
You didn't have to do this.

225
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,416
No nephew of mine is going to stow away on a ship without some backup!

226
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,329
Thank you, Uncle.

227
00:20:38,397 --> 00:20:40,485
Someone's coming!

228
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:48,460
Stay hidden until we get to the North Pole and the Avatar will be yours! Good luck!

229
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:53,804
I carved this necklace for your grandmother when we got engaged.

230
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:59,094
I thought we would have a long, happy life together. I loved her.

231
00:20:59,137 --> 00:21:04,337
But she didn't love you, did she? It was an arranged marriage.

232
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:08,315
Gran Gran wouldn't let your tribe's stupid customs run her life.

233
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:14,031
That's why she left. It must have taken a lot of courage.

234
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,362
Go get her.

235
00:21:23,312 --> 00:21:25,368
What do you want from me?

236
00:21:25,433 --> 00:21:29,337
Nothing. I just want you to know, I think you're beautiful...

237
00:21:29,383 --> 00:21:32,523
...and, I never thought a girl like you would even notice a guy like me.

238
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:34,195
You don't understand.

239
00:21:34,232 --> 00:21:38,741
No, no, see, that's the thing. I think I do understand now.

240
00:21:38,812 --> 00:21:43,096
You're a princess, and I... I'm just a southern peasant.

241
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:44,620
No, Sokka...

242
00:21:44,665 --> 00:21:51,383
It's okay. You don't have to say anything. I'll see ya around, okay?

243
00:21:53,092 --> 00:21:58,709
Okay, now I'm really confused! Happy... but confused!

244
00:21:58,771 --> 00:22:05,736
I do like you! A lot. But, we can't be together... and not for the reason you think.

245
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:10,317
It's because... I'm engaged.

246
00:22:11,418 --> 00:22:13,618
I'm sorry!

247
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:25,723
Not bad! Not bad! Heheh!

248
00:22:25,783 --> 00:22:31,047
Keep practicing and maybe you'll get it by the time you're my age!

249
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,272
Hey Katara!

250
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:39,362
What do you think you're doing? It's past sunrise. You're late.

251
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:40,597
Good to see ya here.

252
00:22:40,653 --> 00:22:42,778
You too.

253
00:22:50,195 --> 00:22:56,847
My fleet is ready. Set a course for the Northern Water Tribe.

254
00:23:04,688 --> 00:23:07,986
