revealed his ability to bloodbend</i>

11
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:43,790

Book one
Chapter nine:
Out of The Past

14
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:20,395
What are you doing?

15
00:01:21,262 --> 00:01:22,011
Tarrlok!

16
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,641
You can't keep me in
here forever!

17
00:01:54,102 --> 00:01:56,608
Who is this?,
It's six in the morning!

18
00:01:56,897 --> 00:01:58,244
This better be important!

19
00:01:59,957 --> 00:02:01,460
Councilman Tenzin here.

20
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:03,566
What?

21
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:16,446
What happened?

22
00:02:17,032 --> 00:02:18,572
What was Korra doing at City Hall?

23
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:20,808
As I told Chief Saikhan,

24
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,119
Korra came to my office last night.

25
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:25,928
She was upset that I arrested her friends.

26
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:27,894
She asked me to release them and-

27
00:02:28,913 --> 00:02:30,588
that's when the Equalist's attacked.

28
00:02:32,464 --> 00:02:33,864
I tried to protect Korra.

29
00:02:34,516 --> 00:02:35,612
We were outnumbered,

30
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:38,328
then, I was electrocuted.

31
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:44,675
When I came to, the police had arrived.

32
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,340
But Korra was gone.

33
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,755
I'm so sorry.

34
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:51,167
Chief Saikhan, mobilize
the entire police force.

35
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,031
We have to find the Avatar.

36
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:59,116
We interrupt your regularly scheduled
broadcast to bring you this special report.

37
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,785
Late last night, Equalists
attacked City Hall,

38
00:03:01,788 --> 00:03:04,718
subduing Councilman Tarrlok
and capturing Avatar Korra.

39
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,662
Details are still coming in, b-

40
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,422
Hope you got enough beauty rest.

41
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,196
Come on, I'm busting you out.

44
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,344
Cover your ears! I can't
go with you listening.

45
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:53,003
Asami!

46
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:55,941
A little privacy, please!

47
00:03:57,102 --> 00:03:57,866
Are you allright?

48
00:03:58,012 --> 00:04:00,100
I'm fine! It's so good to see you.

49
00:04:00,242 --> 00:04:01,979
Hate to break up your lovers' reunion,

50
00:04:02,323 --> 00:04:03,516
but Korra's in trouble.

51
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:05,096
Amon captured her.

52
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,548
No.

53
00:04:07,619 --> 00:04:09,170
No, she can't be gone!

54
00:04:09,772 --> 00:04:11,841
Come on, we have an Avatar to rescue.

55
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:17,047
Your fly was down.

56
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:18,792
Thanks for watching that.

57
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:27,549
Somebody!

58
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:29,361
Help!

59
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:31,205
Please!

60
00:04:34,534 --> 00:04:35,264
Please.

61
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:39,685
I urge you to meditate on these visions.

62
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,072
I believe Aang's spirit is
trying to tell you something.

63
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:58,168
What are you doing here, Aang?

64
00:04:58,186 --> 00:05:00,650
I told you, I have this under control.

65
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:03,480
Under normal circumstances,
I wouldn't get involved,

66
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:06,878
but if what those victims said is true,
we're not dealing with a normal criminal.

67
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,631
Fine. Follow me, Twinkletoes.

68
00:05:09,972 --> 00:05:13,915
Toph, I'm forty years old. Do you think
you could stop with the nicknames?

69
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:14,917
'Fraid not.

70
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:22,514
It's over! You're under
arrest, Yakone!

71
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:25,240
What is Republic City coming to?

72
00:05:25,644 --> 00:05:28,631
Used to be, a man could
enjoy his lunch in peace.

73
00:05:32,728 --> 00:05:34,104
What's the big idea?

74
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,575
We have dozens of witnesses, Yakone.

75
00:05:37,134 --> 00:05:38,436
We know what you are.

76
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:39,458
Take him away.

77
00:05:39,602 --> 00:05:43,278
I've beaten every trumped-up charge
you yahoos have brought against me.

78
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,634
And I'll beat this one, too!

79
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:48,967
Woow.

80
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,577
I finally connected with you, Aang.

81
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:54,398
But- what are you trying to tell me?

82
00:05:55,142 --> 00:05:57,054
A way out of this box would be nice.

83
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,726
I have to go.

84
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:07,240
Call me back the minute you hear anything.

85
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:09,907
Lin? Wh-wh-what, What are you-

86
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:11,430
You should be in the hospital!

87
00:06:11,743 --> 00:06:13,328
And you three! You should be in prison!

88
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:15,570
I figured you could use
our help finding Korra.

89
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:16,786
Do you have any leads?

90
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:19,972
I've been on the phone all
morning, but...nothing yet.

91
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:21,316
We need Naga!

92
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,726
She can track Korra.

93
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:25,442
I'm afraid her polar bear
dog is missing as well.

94
00:06:25,577 --> 00:06:26,651
Then where do we start?

95
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:29,392
My guess is the Equalists
are hiding underground,

96
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:31,714
in the maze of tunnels beneath the city.

97
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:33,194
Underground...

98
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:35,461
just like my father's secret factory.

99
00:06:36,135 --> 00:06:36,786
Figures.

100
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:38,837
Yeah! Yeah, that makes sense!

101
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:42,496
When those chi-blockers had me in their truck,
it sounded like we drove into a tunnel!

102
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:45,225
I know where to start looking!
Come on!

103
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,686
Wherever Amon is keeping Korra,

104
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:49,965
I bet that's where my officers are too.

105
00:06:50,474 --> 00:06:52,073
Let's bring them all home, Lin.

106
00:07:03,358 --> 00:07:05,492
The truck with Bolin took
off down this alley.

107
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:10,789
Which way?

108
00:07:11,543 --> 00:07:14,980
Hmm. This way kinda...
smells familiar.

109
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,686
There's a tunnel nearby.

110
00:07:23,947 --> 00:07:24,520
There!

111
00:07:28,788 --> 00:07:30,011
Motorcycle tracks.

112
00:07:30,364 --> 00:07:31,921
Korra has to be in there...

113
00:07:32,673 --> 00:07:33,653
somewhere.

114
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:44,625
Let's try this way.

115
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,361
And what if Korra's not down there?

116
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,377
Then we pick another
tunnel until we find her!

117
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,702
Hey, is Mako all right?

118
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,233
He seems
really worried about Korra.

119
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:01,008
Yeah, we all are!

120
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,489
I know, but,

121
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,876
he's your brother. Do you think that he
likes Korra as more than just a friend?

122
00:08:07,616 --> 00:08:11,712
W-What!? No! That's, just
gossip, where'd you hear that?

123
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:14,969
Crazy talk is coming out a
your mouth right now. Heh...

124
00:08:15,815 --> 00:08:18,789
What do you know, Bolin?
Come on, spill it.

125
00:08:18,892 --> 00:08:20,472
Nothing!, I mean.

126
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:24,694
there was this one time during the
tournament when Mako and Korra kissed, but...

127
00:08:24,696 --> 00:08:25,758
They...kissed?

128
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:30,696
Believe me, I was upset too, but- I'm over it.
I don't think it meant anything.

129
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:32,042
I doubt that.

130
00:08:37,677 --> 00:08:38,405
Hide!

131
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,288
That tram goes to the training camp.

132
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,779
Everything was delivered
to the prison, sir.

133
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,641
That's where they must be keeping Korra.

134
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:22,251
We need to get down that tunnel.

135
00:09:44,489 --> 00:09:47,134
- It's empty?!
- Yeah, I can see that.

136
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:54,562
You two, keep an eye on them.

137
00:10:00,838 --> 00:10:02,236
My officers are inside.

138
00:10:02,576 --> 00:10:03,461
What about Korra?

139
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:05,308
I don't see her yet.

140
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:24,176
Avatar Korra. Where
are you keeping her?

141
00:10:30,702 --> 00:10:31,811
Chief Beifong?

142
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:34,230
I'm too late.

143
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,417
That monster already took
your bending, didn't he?

144
00:10:39,617 --> 00:10:40,860
I'm so sorry.

145
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,115
Come on, let's gets you out of here.

146
00:10:45,524 --> 00:10:47,107
I'll ask you one more time;

147
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:48,605
where is she?

148
00:10:48,944 --> 00:10:52,463
We don't have the Avatar, and the
Equalists didn't attack City Hall.

149
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:53,720
Tarrlok's lying.

150
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:54,417
What?

151
00:10:54,773 --> 00:10:57,606
I scanned the entire prison.
Korra's not here.

152
00:10:58,046 --> 00:11:00,888
Why would Tarrlok make up a
story about getting attacked?

153
00:11:01,172 --> 00:11:02,984
Because he has Korra.

154
00:11:03,213 --> 00:11:04,314
He fooled us all!

155
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:09,409
Let's go, people!

156
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:31,637
Try to chi-block that, fools!

157
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:38,657
We got more company!

158
00:11:43,058 --> 00:11:43,738
Stick out!.

159
00:12:04,002 --> 00:12:08,142
Yakone has ruled Republic City's
criminal empire for years.

160
00:12:08,448 --> 00:12:11,560
Yet he has always managed to stay
out of the law's reach,

161
00:12:11,573 --> 00:12:13,008
until now.

162
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:18,669
You will hear testimony from dozens
of his victims and they will tell you,

163
00:12:18,713 --> 00:12:26,029
Yakone has maintained his grip on the underworld
by using an ability that has been illegal for decades.

164
00:12:26,943 --> 00:12:28,163
Bloodbending.

165
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,533
The prosecution's entire case,

166
00:12:33,592 --> 00:12:39,830
is built upon the make-believe notion that
my client is able to bloodbend at will,

167
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:42,282
at any time on any day.

168
00:12:42,723 --> 00:12:47,356
I remind to council that bloodbending
is an incredibly rare skill

169
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:50,528
and it can only be performed
during a full moon.

170
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:56,904
Yet, the witnesses will claim that my client
used bloodbending at every other time,

171
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:59,329
except during a full moon.

172
00:12:59,575 --> 00:13:06,620
It would be a mockery of justice to convict a
man of a crime that is impossible to commit.

173
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,392
Councilman Sokka will now
deliver the verdict.

174
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:23,145
In my years, I've encountered people born
with rare and unique bending abilities.

175
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,635
I once bested a man with my trusty boomerang
who was able to firebend with his mind.

176
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:32,719
Why, even metalbending was considered
impossible for all of history

177
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:38,453
until our esteemed Chief of Police, Toph
Beifong, singlehandedly developed the skill.

178
00:13:39,498 --> 00:13:43,648
The overwhelming amount of testimony
and evidence has convinced this council

179
00:13:43,918 --> 00:13:50,798
that Yakone is one of these unique benders and he
exploited his ability to commit these heinous crimes.

180
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:57,647
We find Yakone guilty of all charges
and sentence him to life in prison.

181
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:37,454
Thank you all for meeting
us on such short notice.

182
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,503
Chief.

183
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:39,275
Lin.

184
00:14:40,706 --> 00:14:42,230
Have you got any news on Avatar Korra?

185
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,180
We do.
You kidnapped her, Tarrlok!

186
00:14:45,462 --> 00:14:48,925
I am shocked you would accuse
me of such an evil act!

187
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:52,479
I'd already explained, Equalists
attacked and took her!

188
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,893
But there were no Chi
blockers here last night.

189
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:57,017
You planted the evidence, didn't you?

190
00:14:57,052 --> 00:14:59,475
That is a ridiculous accusation!

191
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,627
It's true!, He took her!

192
00:15:02,364 --> 00:15:05,111
I was here when Avatar Korra
arrived last night, but

193
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,333
Councilman Tarrlok ordered me to leave.

194
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,426
I was on my way out when I saw Tarrlok
bring her down to the garage.

195
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:14,042
Say goodbye to Republic City, Avatar Korra.

196
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,896
You'll never see it again.

197
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:24,230
That's nonsense,

198
00:15:24,331 --> 00:15:26,926
Everyone know you're nothing but
a scrawny squeaky-voiced liar!

199
00:15:26,987 --> 00:15:28,814
Why did you wait until now to 'fess up?

200
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:30,831
I was terrified to tell because...

201
00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:33,304
Because Tarrlok is a Bloodbender!

202
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:35,325
He bloodbent Avatar Korra!

203
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:39,722
Don't make this worse for yourself.
Tell us where you have Korra.

204
00:16:07,492 --> 00:16:08,121
Wake up!

205
00:16:11,075 --> 00:16:17,493
Urgh! Man! I had this awful dream that Korra
was taken by this evil bloodbender. So weird.

206
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:20,381
Bolin, that really happened.
He knocked us out.

207
00:16:20,977 --> 00:16:23,444
Are you serious?! Where is he?
Is he here right now?

208
00:16:23,457 --> 00:16:26,699
Tarrlok is long gone.
I'll alert the whole force.

209
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,094
We've only been out for a little while.

210
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:31,317
Maybe we can still pick up Tarrlok's trail.

211
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:33,718
It could lead us to Korra!, Let's go.

212
00:17:04,894 --> 00:17:08,248
Yakone. You won't get away with this!

213
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:15,464
Republic City's mine, Avatar. I'll
be back one day to claim it.

214
00:17:58,889 --> 00:18:01,986
This time I'm gonna put
you to sleep for good!

215
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:25,545
I'm taking away your bending...for good.

216
00:18:35,778 --> 00:18:36,576
It's over.

217
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:40,223
Aang,

218
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:44,714
this whole time. You were trying
to warn me about Tarrlok.

219
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:51,281
My life is a disaster
now, thanks to you.

220
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:53,724
So your little
bloodbending secret's out?

221
00:18:55,876 --> 00:18:58,474
And I know how you bloodbent
me without a full moon,

222
00:18:58,981 --> 00:19:00,426
You're Yakone's son.

223
00:19:01,603 --> 00:19:03,122
I was his son,

224
00:19:03,671 --> 00:19:05,669
but in order to win Republic City,

225
00:19:05,922 --> 00:19:07,573
I had to become someone else.

226
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:13,386
My father failed because he tried to rule
the city from its rotten underbelly.

227
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:15,502
My plan was perfect.

228
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:19,552
I was to be the city's savior.
But you-

229
00:19:20,353 --> 00:19:22,693
you ruined everything!

230
00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:25,727
Tarrlok, the jig is up and
you have nowhere to go.

231
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:30,568
Oh no. No, I'll escape
and start a new life.

232
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:34,064
And you are coming as my hostage.

233
00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:36,089
You'll never get away with this!

234
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:43,121
Amon!

235
00:19:44,912 --> 00:19:47,339
It is time for you to be equalized.

236
00:19:48,346 --> 00:19:52,064
You fool!, You've never
faced bending like mine.

237
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:07,301
What?

238
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,652
What are you?

239
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,053
I'm a solution.

240
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:31,157
I'll take care of him. You
four retrieve the Avatar.

241
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:32,945
Do not underestimate her.

242
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,438
Electrocute the box to knock
her out before you open it.

243
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:37,393
My pleasure.

244
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:46,601
It's payback time.

245
00:21:03,591 --> 00:21:04,683
Open the box.

246
00:21:08,195 --> 00:21:08,954
Tie her up.

247
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,412
I thought I told you not
to underestimate her.

248
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:17,155
Naga.

249
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:18,917
You came looking for me.

250
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:20,469
Good girl.

251
00:22:37,892 --> 00:22:39,049
That sounds like Naga!

252
00:22:42,136 --> 00:22:42,851
Down there!

253
00:22:45,735 --> 00:22:46,420
Korra!

254
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,162
Oh, thank goodness.

255
00:22:49,165 --> 00:22:50,158
Where's Tarrlok?

256
00:22:50,461 --> 00:22:51,569
How did you get away?

257
00:22:51,715 --> 00:22:52,977
Give her some space!

258
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:00,895
I was so worried.

259
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:02,570
Are you all right?

260
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,570
I'm fine.

261
00:23:04,788 --> 00:23:05,908
I'm glad you're here.

262
00:23:11,951 --> 00:23:13,162
You're safe now.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
