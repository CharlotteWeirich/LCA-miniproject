1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,900
Earth

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,850
Fire

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,500
Air

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,300
Water

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Only the Avatar can master all four elements
...

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,200
And bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,925
Korra returned to Republic City

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,100
But Bolin and Varrick
are still at large.

9
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,800
For weeks ago
Korra removed the poison that remained in his body,

10
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,425
But the memory of the attack of Zaheer
still haunts her.

11
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:38,025
And after being defeated by Kuvira
,

12
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,350
Does not believe in his full recovery.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,000
Meanwhile, Kuvira was spoon
spiritual vines in the swamp.

14
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:47,125
But how close is finished
their spiritual energy weapon?

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,800
BOOK 4 BALANCE CHAPTER 9
"WILD BEYOND"

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,000
All, mother,
we can stay close, please?

17
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:57,475
The tour is about to begin
.

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,250
This is my boy, Ryu.

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,700
He lived in the basement

20
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:02,275
But then
received command of the air,

21
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,100
And has done important things
by the Air Nation.

22
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,050
His father and I
are here to visit you,

23
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:10,675
And we are really enjoying
the big city.

24
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:13,075
We are so proud,
is not, dear?

25
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,200
At least now I have a job.

26
00:01:15,225 --> 00:01:17,375
Mom, Dad,
I'm trying to work.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,500
A curiosity, personal:

28
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,800
All these vines
were created by Unavaatu

29
00:01:23,825 --> 00:01:26,125
When he fought the giant spirit of Korra

30
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,750
The fate of the world.

31
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,150
Excuse me, we are
in the spirit world?

32
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
No.

33
00:01:34,825 --> 00:01:37,975
The Spirit World
is on the ground beneath us?

34
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,450
No, can I just read
my guides?

35
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,900
- Honey, do not be nervous.
- I'm not nervous!

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,250
Why
vine that is coming in our direction?

37
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,900
I do not see anything about it
in my guides.

38
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,450
I will mess you
with a stick.

39
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:56,475
Do not!
Why did you do that?

40
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,750
Return all back!

41
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,150
This tour is exciting!

42
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,550
Is not he the best air domineering
all?

43
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,500
Is everything okay?

44
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,200
No, Kuvira has
my family

45
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:37,225
And no one but me
seem to care.

46
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,650
All we care.

47
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,050
Do not worry.
Let's get them back.

48
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,900
There I am.

49
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,375
I felt a strange surge of spiritual energy

50
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,200
To come from spiritual jungles.

51
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,950
Something's wrong.

52
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,950
Are you sure you felt
a disturbance?

53
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,450
Perhaps you sense you've barely
with something you ate.

54
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,450
I'm telling you.
I felt.

55
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,150
Maybe something happened
with Ryu group.

56
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,050
We should have found them.

57
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:06,125
Yes, but it's Ryu.

58
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,400
Can be at the mall,
for all we know.

59
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,200
Korra, you can not feel
how strange is energy?

60
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,050
No, but...

61
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,850
Maybe you can make a reading
.

62
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,050
Korra, what was it?
You are fine?

63
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:37,475
It is the Kuvira.

64
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,600
I saw her spoon vines
swamp.

65
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,950
Must be affecting our spiritual
jungles.

66
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:44,000
I bet that's
you were feeling.

67
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:46,075
Why she's the scoop
vines?

68
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,800
Whatever the reason,
I am sure that is not good.

69
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:50,225
We have to tell the Raiko.

70
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,500
This can help convince other leaders

71
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:54,025
Finally do away with it.

72
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,950
I will continue to look for
Ryu and others.

73
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,050
I think we should deal with
Kuvira immediately.

74
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,450
Yes! I agree!

75
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,975
I know how get rid of it,

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,300
Tell you who won
vacation with all expenses paid

77
00:04:06,325 --> 00:04:07,625
A tropical island.

78
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,350
So when you get there,
reveal it was a trick.

79
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,525
The island is a prison!
Ready! We caught her!

80
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,500
Or, okay...

81
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,250
I'm only advise.

82
00:04:17,275 --> 00:04:20,575
Marched with an army of moles
-badger.

83
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,900
Does anyone know if the Kuvira
have any allergies?

84
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:28,475
I think we all know
what should be done.

85
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,100
We take the fight
to her.

86
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,225
I do not think that attacking
is the right move,

87
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,100
Since she has not done anything aggressive


88
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,625
- For the United Republic.
- Not yet.

89
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:38,525
But we can not rely on
Kuvira.

90
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,500
She told us that gave
power and did not.

91
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:42,925
I agree with the Raiko.

92
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,050
We must take the offensive and begin
to resume Zaofu.

93
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,500
President Raiko,
sorry to interrupt, but...

94
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,950
- What is happening here?
- Hello, Avatar Korra.

95
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:53,925
We're just having a meeting of world leaders
,

96
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,100
To find out what to do with the Kuvira.

97
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,925
For the record, I told Raiko
I should have invited you.

98
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,050
Invited him to it,
but not me?

99
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:04,475
Please Korra,
is not personal.

100
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,900
Just think, perhaps, have we called

101
00:05:06,925 --> 00:05:08,625
Too early to return to active.

102
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,300
Again...
Him, I do not?

103
00:05:11,325 --> 00:05:12,825
We are half
a meeting

104
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,350
Can not have people
to appear when they want!

105
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Personal!

106
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:18,075
Perfect!
They're all here!

107
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,450
Bolin?

108
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:21,775
What are you doing here?

109
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,750
Guards,
remove these intruders.

110
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,150
Do not!

111
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:28,425
We fled the Kuvira Army.
We're back at your side.

112
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,900
We have intelligence
for you!

113
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,100
I believe we should have started
by the way.

114
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,700
Listen to me. The Kuvira
is doing this thing going...

115
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,950
I do not know how it works,
but has this...

116
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,550
It is a super weapon.

117
00:05:48,575 --> 00:05:50,375
As a normal weapon,
except it's super!

118
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,600
And let me guess.

119
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,675
It has something to do with the spiritual
vines.

120
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,300
Yes! How did you know?

121
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:58,325
I saw her spoon vines
swamp.

122
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,100
If she finds out how to use that power,

123
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,725
We are all doomed.

124
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,000
It can use the weapon to attack
Republic City.

125
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:08,325
The only way to protect ourselves is
with a preemptive strike.

126
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,450
The rulers of mine air will not make
part of an unprovoked attack.

127
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,300
Not the Fire Nation.

128
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,900
But
Lady Fire Izumi

129
00:06:14,925 --> 00:06:16,725
The Kuvira is a threat
to the world.

130
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,150
It needs to be stopped!

131
00:06:18,175 --> 00:06:20,975
The Fire Nation
spent too much in its history

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,700
Fighting wars
meaningless.

133
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,650
And I refuse to drag
my nation to another,

134
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:27,675
Unless there is no other choice
.

135
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,850
If they attack Kuvira,
will be without my army.

136
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,050
Okay.
I will postpone any attack plans.

137
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,450
Let's get defensive

138
00:06:36,475 --> 00:06:38,325
And increase security at the borders.

139
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,900
This,
will my help.

140
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,800
Opal, wait!
Please...

141
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:47,675
I just want to say
I regret so much for everything.

142
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,300
I'm glad you are doing well,

143
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,275
But it's a little late
to repent.

144
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,300
I know. I know.
I did not hear you.

145
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:54,625
I was on the side of Kuvira,

146
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,400
Helped her to win
the Earth Kingdom,

147
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:58,625
Taking your house,
and capturing your mother,

148
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,350
Of your brothers and your father...

149
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,250
Wow! That sounds really bad
when I say aloud.

150
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:04,675
But I will try to change everything
for you.

151
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,350
Forgive me, lovebirds,
but I need to talk to Opal.

152
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,200
In particular.

153
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,950
I'm sorry, kid. But Raiko
failed to convince

154
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,725
The other leaders to attack the Kuvira.

155
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,350
So our family...

156
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,875
It seems ourselves
have to save them.

157
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,450
Do you think other people

158
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:24,575
- Agree to go with us?
- This was not allowed.

159
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,100
It is a dangerous mission into enemy territory
.

160
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,500
We can not ask others to
risk their lives for our family.

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,750
If we want to rescue them,
we will have to act alone.

162
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Bolin,
am glad that you have come back.

163
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,100
- I was worried about you.
- We all were.

164
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,850
Thank you, friends.

165
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,775
Mako, I'm sorry for the way
as we left things.

166
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,600
I'm such a fool.

167
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,375
You tried to warn me about the Kuvira
,

168
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:51,375
And I was on her side,
like a fool.

169
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,150
You were right,
'm just an idiot.

170
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,400
I hope to be able
to earn your trust again.

171
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,650
If anyone has lost confidence
in people, I went.

172
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,600
Since Kuvira defeated me,
no one wants me around.

173
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,300
We want you around.

174
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:08,475
And Bolin,
I am not a fool.

175
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,050
I was just doing what
You thought right.

176
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,350
I love you.

177
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,250
I embrace them again.

178
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,950
Korra! The vines!
They are taking me!

179
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:02,975
Help!

180
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,050
Get all here!
Take a barrier.

181
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:13,575
Cancels all tours.
Someone call Tenzin.

182
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,200
We have to go in there and find
Jinora.

183
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,600
I think nobody
should go there now.

184
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,850
I know I'm not the Avatar
it used to be

185
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,175
But I can do this.

186
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,500
Be careful.

187
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,050
- Jinora!
- Hello! Anyone here?

188
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,000
Expected.
Did you hear that?

189
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,500
Let's go.

190
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,700
Korra, look.

191
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,400
What are those things?

192
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,100
It is the Jinora and the rest of them.

193
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,650
Their spirits are trapped
in the Spirit World.

194
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,150
- Let's get out of here.
- No!

195
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,900
It will cause the vines.
Let me try.

196
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,400
They will not open.

197
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,900
Perhaps meditate
in the spirit world,

198
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:45,225
Can free them.

199
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,650
Wait...

200
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,350
This is not
the spiritual world.

201
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,200
Zaheer! No!

202
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,150
You can not fight me
and against the poison.

203
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,800
- No, I removed it.
- You shall never remove it.

204
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:35,601
Korra, what's the problem?

205
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,800
- It Zaheer.
- What are you talking about?

206
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:41,275
It has haunted me since
fought him.

207
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,950
I can not be at peace.

208
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,100
It's like you're preventing me

209
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,975
Meditating
in the Spirit World.

210
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm here to help you.
What do you need?

211
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,350
- I face Zaheer.
- Korra, it is very dangerous.

212
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,000
Even arrested,
it is not reliable.

213
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:58,725
Need if you want to save
Jinora and others.

214
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,150
- There is another way.
- There is another way.

215
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,900
I'll call your father,
it can make an expedition

216
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:06,125
To the Spirit World
the South Portal.

217
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:08,375
Also lost faith in me,
not lost?

218
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,700
Everyone thinks that I am unable to do anything
.

219
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:14,825
- This is not it.
- I know I can do this.

220
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,225
I'm so worried
with Jinora.

221
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,800
I can not imagine anything happening to you.

222
00:12:19,825 --> 00:12:21,375
Tenzin, please.

223
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,050
I'll be fine.

224
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,800
The Zaheer is stuck in the depths
the mountains outside the city.

225
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,900
I'll call Raiko
and get his approval.

226
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:31,225
Thank you.

227
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,450
Pa-baps, where are you?

228
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,650
Pabu!

229
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,600
I felt you so much.

230
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,700
So, I do not know if you heard, but the
Opal is angry with me.

231
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,650
He was waiting for me
ajudasses to win her back.

232
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,000
Amazing!
Yes, I had an idea.

233
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,300
Hello, Pabu.

234
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,900
Yes, it's also good to see you.
What do you have there?

235
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,350
- Opal, got it.
- What is this?

236
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,275
A picnic,
just for the two of us.

237
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,050
I mean three.
Sorry, Pabs.

238
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:22,975
So this ticket that brought me Pabu

239
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Saying
broke his legs, was a trick?

240
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:30,525
Perhaps. But now you're here,
do not want to sit down, relax...

241
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,250
Try my cookies.
It is a recipe Pema.

242
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:35,725
And see the Pabu
to make their performances

243
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,650
Most famous for entertainment.

244
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,550
Homemade cookies.
Preferred mine.

245
00:13:42,575 --> 00:13:45,675
This will make me forget
which worked for Kuvira,

246
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,550
The person arrested
my family.

247
00:13:47,575 --> 00:13:49,875
And that probably is
the torture this time.

248
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,150
So, yes. Let's sit down
and make a great picnic

249
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:55,175
Because we are so in love!

250
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,350
I'm sorry that you saw this,
Pabu.

251
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,800
Thank you for coming.

252
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,150
It's nice to be welcomed back with open arms
.

253
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,050
In fact, I called him here
necessity.

254
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,300
It is no secret
I do not like you.

255
00:14:13,325 --> 00:14:15,425
Especially after trying
kidnap me.

256
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,950
Supposedly.

257
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,125
For. Everything you do
is "supposedly".

258
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,100
Like when you took possession
my company

259
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,825
Bombardeaste and the cultural center
of the Southern Water Tribe.

260
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,150
I built it!

261
00:14:27,175 --> 00:14:29,575
A man is entitled
to blow up your property!

262
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,200
Right now, I need you put
your differences aside.

263
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,075
If Kuvira is really
to create a super weapon

264
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,200
We need the brightest minds

265
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:39,125
Working together to prevent it.

266
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:41,675
What do you say, Asami?
Partner again?

267
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,600
Okay.
I will help.

268
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,200
But you dare not even think
in fool me again.

269
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,400
You sure you're ready
for this?

270
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,250
I have. I think if you see the chained Zaheer
,

271
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:12,700
Will recognize that it is no longer a threat.

272
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,100
Get closer to the wall.

273
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,350
No.
I need to do this alone.

274
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,800
I thought you were appearing,
sooner or later.

275
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,050
So...

276
00:16:14,075 --> 00:16:17,675
You should really be in trouble
if you came here to see me.

277
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,450
I came here to look in your eyes

278
00:16:20,475 --> 00:16:23,025
And tell you that you no longer have
no more power over me.

279
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,450
I will not be afraid
you.

280
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,900
I think it's not true.

281
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,000
Yet seem scared.

282
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,250
- This was a mistake.
- I know why you're here.

283
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:42,025
You know nothing about me!

284
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,300
Can not you come
in the Spirit World.

285
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,850
I spend most of my time there,

286
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,975
And everyone knows that the spirit of Avatar

287
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,900
Is not seen there a few years.

288
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:55,725
You can meditate there
from here?

289
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,850
Do you feel spiritually
distressed?

290
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,250
Is this your problem.

291
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,150
Republic City is taking
of spiritual energy

292
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,050
And I do not even
can you feel it.

293
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:07,275
No, my problem is you!

294
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:11,250
You poisoned me!
You ruined me!

295
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,300
People thought me
unstoppable

296
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,625
But now I find that I am not capable of anything.

297
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,500
Blaming me is a crutch
you feel better to you,

298
00:17:18,525 --> 00:17:20,275
But it is not helping
anything.

299
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:23,575
I thought personally see you
would put an end to all this.

300
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,850
Maybe it's time to give me account

301
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,275
Would never be the same.

302
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
None of us will return to
the same as before.

303
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:31,675
I learned to fly,
but now I am in chains.

304
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,400
You have all the power in the world
and freedom to use it,

305
00:17:34,425 --> 00:17:36,325
But preferiste suppress you.

306
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,950
I'm not repress me,
but my powers have limits.

307
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,275
You're wrong.

308
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,000
That poison should have killed you.

309
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:44,925
But could you
to combat it.

310
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,000
Do you think that your powers have limits
,

311
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,075
I would say are unlimited.

312
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Any.

313
00:17:50,225 --> 00:17:53,025
Before, you spoke about always
chaos and freedom.

314
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,500
Then
killed the Queen of Earth

315
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:57,425
And have created the worst dictator
that the Kingdom has ever seen.

316
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,800
Thank you for that.

317
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,500
I heard rumors about it,

318
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:04,825
But I did not know
had achieved so much power.

319
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,750
It needs to be stopped.

320
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,900
I can not stop her,
unless they get over it.

321
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,700
I think I can help you.

322
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:14,025
Let me guide you
to the Spirit World.

323
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,450
Not at all.
I can not trust you.

324
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,200
Maybe not.
But if you had any other option

325
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:21,325
Would not be here,
is it?

326
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,200
We have been enemies
once, but now

327
00:18:24,225 --> 00:18:25,975
Our interests are the same.

328
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,300
I came here.
What do you have to lose?

329
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,850
Concentrate on the sound of my voice

330
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,700
And empty your mind.

331
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,400
- Let her go.
- I can not!

332
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,400
You can.
Accepted what happened to you.

333
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:06,325
Do not fear what could have happened
.

334
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:10,025
- I have no control.
- Do not be afraid. Hold on!

335
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,700
I got.

336
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,800
And you brought me
far.

337
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,350
Do you know where is the Jinora
and the others are?

338
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,950
No, but I know.

339
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,500
Raava, missed you.
Where were you?

340
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:40,275
Always been within
you.

341
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Can you help me find the
Jinora?

342
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,000
How do
freed their spirits?

343
00:19:58,025 --> 00:20:00,625
You must master your inner energy.

344
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,950
But I have powers
in the Spirit World.

345
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:05,475
No.
You are more powerful here.

346
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,650
In the spiritual world,

347
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:09,875
Are you connected with every spiritual energy.

348
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:55,651
I'm all in a spiritual way.

349
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,500
Father!

350
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,750
I'm so glad you are doing well.

351
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,900
What happened?
How did you escaped?

352
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,600
The Korra saved us.

353
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,750
So... How do you feel yourself?

354
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,250
I feel...
whole again.

355
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,000
I feel good.

356
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:21,125
Do you think you will be able
to forget what Zaheer did?

357
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,800
No.

358
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,000
But finally I can
to accept what happened,

359
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:28,325
And I think it will strengthen me.

360
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,550
Where are you going?

361
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,400
We have family business
to treat.

362
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,850
Okay, listen.
Before you left,

363
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,875
Just want to tell you that
understand how you feel.

364
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,600
I know there is nothing I can do

365
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,400
Or no action to correct my mistakes, but...

366
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,400
That does not mean I'll stop trying to recover
you when you return.

367
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Because...

368
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,800
I love you.

369
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
Thank you for saying all this.

370
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,400
There is one thing you can do to regain
me.

371
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,300
What is it?
Yes, do anything.

372
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
Come undercover
us.

373
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,950
- Where?
- Zaofu.

374
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
We will rescue my family.

375
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,100
