<i>And now "The transcredible
exploits of Zapp Brannigan"

3
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:27,377
<i>brought to you by
Bartley's rocket wax.

4
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:29,912
I wax my rocket every day!

5
00:00:34,963 --> 00:00:37,415
No one can save you
now, Leela.

6
00:00:37,483 --> 00:00:39,389
What about Zapp Brannigan?

7
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:42,704
Well, obviously, Zapp Brannigan
could save you, but...

8
00:00:42,772 --> 00:00:44,142
Zapp Brannigan?!

9
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:47,356
So, Emperor Chopchop,
once again, we meet at last.

10
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:50,368
Drop that space gun
or I'll shoot... like so.

11
00:00:50,436 --> 00:00:52,242
Ooh.

12
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,551
Oh! Oh, Zapp.

13
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:56,625
Tie me back up
and ravish me.

14
00:00:56,694 --> 00:00:59,069
I'd like to,
Leela, so I will.

15
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:07,871
Mmm, shake it, baby.

16
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,111
Shake it like...

17
00:01:09,178 --> 00:01:11,320
I surrender and
volunteer for treason.

18
00:01:11,387 --> 00:01:13,895
Emergency summons
from the president, Captain.

19
00:01:13,964 --> 00:01:15,268
Oh, it's you.

20
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:16,473
Just let me freshen up.

21
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,051
Computer, Captain's musk.

22
00:01:37,156 --> 00:01:39,601
The long, dramatic corridor.

23
00:01:39,668 --> 00:01:41,641
That's never a good sign.

24
00:01:43,885 --> 00:01:44,854
Glove recognized.

25
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:48,034
Proceed, Mrs. Eisenhower.

26
00:01:49,073 --> 00:01:51,079
Mr. President.
What the hell?

27
00:01:51,147 --> 00:01:52,752
At ease, Brannigan.

28
00:01:54,226 --> 00:01:57,170
What you're about to see
is highly classified.

29
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,410
Reptilicus,

30
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:00,116
hit the thingy.

31
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,664
At oh-zero-hundred hours,

32
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,479
planet X-3 was attacked by
a mysterious death-sphere.

33
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:09,789
Magnify that death-sphere.

34
00:02:11,062 --> 00:02:12,968
Why is it still blurry?

35
00:02:13,036 --> 00:02:15,177
That's all the
resolution we have.

36
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:17,452
Making it bigger
doesn't make it clearer.

37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,758
It does on CSI: Miami.

38
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:23,275
They fought back with
advanced military hardware,

39
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:27,862
but it was like shooting
bbs at Bebe Rebozo.

40
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:30,070
That poor, brave hardware.

41
00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:33,517
The sphere then fired some
kind of hellish blackout ray.

42
00:02:33,584 --> 00:02:38,704
Erased that planet like 18
minutes of incriminating tape.

43
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,027
Oh, I just wish
I understood why.

44
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:45,498
Why I should care.

45
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:48,478
Because the death-sphere
is now on course for Earth.

46
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:51,756
Aroo!

47
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:55,104
My God, we're defenseless,
like fish in a barrel.

48
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:56,243
Options?

49
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,883
My instinct is
to hide in this barrel

50
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:59,388
like the wily fish.

51
00:02:59,457 --> 00:03:01,530
Ah, then we're down
to our last hope:

52
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:05,146
A radical new weapon built
by a visionary scientist

53
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:07,755
I once dismissed as crazy.

54
00:03:10,534 --> 00:03:13,847
Let's see how crazy
I am now, Nixon.

55
00:03:13,915 --> 00:03:16,223
The correct answer is "very."

56
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,929
All right, Professor,

57
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,336
sock it to me.

58
00:03:19,403 --> 00:03:20,977
Top secret news, everyone.

59
00:03:21,043 --> 00:03:23,920
I've developed a tiny,
one-man stealth fighter

60
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:26,397
that's virtually undetectable.

61
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:27,869
How undetectable?

62
00:03:27,937 --> 00:03:29,342
It's right in front of you.

63
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,481
I find that...

64
00:03:30,548 --> 00:03:32,087
Ow! ...To believe.

65
00:03:33,762 --> 00:03:35,534
Hubba, hubba.

66
00:03:35,602 --> 00:03:37,575
But how exactly is this
happy meal toy going

67
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:39,785
to destroy a giant
death-sphere?

68
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,123
From within.

69
00:03:41,191 --> 00:03:43,198
This ship should be able
to sneak, undetected,

70
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:46,177
through the sphere's
one vulnerable opening.

71
00:03:46,244 --> 00:03:47,649
What vulnerable opening?

72
00:03:47,718 --> 00:03:50,428
All death-spheres have
one vulnerable opening.

73
00:03:50,495 --> 00:03:53,072
Well, sure, but who's brave
enough to fly into something

74
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,415
we all keep calling
a death-sphere?

75
00:03:55,483 --> 00:03:57,422
I say Brannigan.
I say no.

76
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:59,631
- I say me.
- I say Leela.

77
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,840
- I say yes.
- I say no.

78
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:03,212
I say Leela, too.

79
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,518
I say yes again.

80
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:06,057
I say I shall join her.

81
00:04:06,124 --> 00:04:07,964
But it's only a one-man craft.

82
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:09,103
I say.

83
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:12,015
There'll only be
one man... Me.

84
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:13,956
How would you feel
if I rode rear

85
00:04:14,023 --> 00:04:16,399
as your personal
tail gunner?

86
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:17,671
Creeped out.

87
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:19,110
Then it's decided.

88
00:04:19,876 --> 00:04:21,855
Cape Knievel
Flight Test Center

89
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,874
Are you sure I have
to sit in your lap?

90
00:04:26,943 --> 00:04:29,586
It'll help us achieve
maximum thrust.

91
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:33,267
I made you some trail mix
for the flight.

92
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:35,776
Also, this picture,
to remember me.

93
00:04:35,845 --> 00:04:37,418
You hold onto it.

94
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,458
I'll be back soon.

95
00:04:41,434 --> 00:04:42,604
Aah!

96
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:44,478
Activating stealth shielding.

97
00:04:47,827 --> 00:04:49,666
Liftoff!

98
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:50,805
I'll Roger that.

99
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:58,869
Does anybody else feel aroused
and jealous and worried?

100
00:04:58,938 --> 00:05:00,778
I haven't felt
much of anything

101
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:03,555
since my Guinea pig died.

102
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:13,563
Death-sphere in range.

103
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,574
Engaging holographic targeting.

104
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:18,983
Activating the force.

105
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:22,364
Male voice
Feel the entrance, Leela.

106
00:05:22,432 --> 00:05:27,385
Destination on your left
in 0.3 miles.

107
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,008
Zapp to Leela.

108
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:35,251
Look at all that
surveillance equipment.

109
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:36,588
We better whisper.

110
00:05:36,657 --> 00:05:39,232
Switching to pillow talk mode.

111
00:05:39,301 --> 00:05:41,976
Look! What are
those huge letters?

112
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:44,924
V-giny?

113
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:46,496
Doesn't ring a bell.

114
00:05:46,564 --> 00:05:50,612
Hmm, I don't like
the looks of this V-giny.

115
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:53,960
Does anyone recognize
those call letters?

116
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:55,465
Nope.

117
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:57,574
It's not in the
janeway's guide either.

118
00:05:57,641 --> 00:06:00,016
Deciphering that I.D. Code
is critical.

119
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:03,264
I'll be in the chamber
of understanding.

120
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:14,642
This is it... the moment we
should have trained for.

121
00:06:29,637 --> 00:06:32,047
Holy cr...

122
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,894
Incoming yucky.
Firing pocket-rocket!

123
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:42,989
Don't panic, Leela.
Go, go, go, go, go.

124
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:52,260
I hope this is
the control stick.

125
00:06:56,913 --> 00:06:59,490
Captain's log.

126
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:01,532
We've lost control.
Addendum...

127
00:07:10,661 --> 00:07:13,673
Chapter two:
"The heat thickens."

128
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:16,116
Leela, wake up.

129
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:18,426
I can't face this
mysterious planet alone

130
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:20,367
without you
or someone like you.

131
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,282
Zapp?
Zapp, wake up.

132
00:07:25,924 --> 00:07:27,897
Leela, where are we?

133
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:30,104
We crashed
on an uncharted planet.

134
00:07:30,174 --> 00:07:32,816
When I woke up,
I was pinned under this tree.

135
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:33,987
Can you help me?

136
00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:36,498
If anyone can
move it, I can.

137
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:39,878
No one can move it.

138
00:07:39,946 --> 00:07:41,083
Are you hurt?

139
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:43,425
No, but I'm so thirsty.

140
00:07:43,494 --> 00:07:46,137
This space suit is making me
sweat like a sow.

141
00:07:46,205 --> 00:07:48,044
Me, too.
We'd better strip them off

142
00:07:48,113 --> 00:07:50,888
and continue surviving
au naturel.

143
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:54,136
Uh... I suppose so.

144
00:07:56,346 --> 00:07:58,152
Here, we can
cover ourselves

145
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,629
with these sticky,
sap-covered leaves.

146
00:08:00,696 --> 00:08:03,238
I'll try to avert my eyes
from your nudery.

147
00:08:03,307 --> 00:08:04,445
You will?

148
00:08:04,513 --> 00:08:05,683
Eh, what's the point?

149
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,322
You'll have to look
sooner or later.

150
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,335
Well, I promise
not to abuse the privilege.

151
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:11,606
For now I'd better
scout ound

152
00:08:11,673 --> 00:08:13,415
for food and
water and help.

153
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:16,191
What a thoughtful
and considerate thing to say.

154
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,831
What the hell's wrong with you?

155
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:19,338
I'm not quite sure.

156
00:08:19,405 --> 00:08:22,552
Perhaps it's the fresh air
or a severe head injury.

157
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:24,692
In any case, I'm off.

158
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,206
If you see any steaks,
that'd be good!

159
00:08:30,316 --> 00:08:31,586
Why isn't Leela back yet?

160
00:08:31,655 --> 00:08:32,926
Do you think she's okay?

161
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:34,131
How should I know?

162
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,306
And how come you
never ask if I'm okay?

163
00:08:36,374 --> 00:08:38,247
I'm feeling
a little neglected here.

164
00:08:38,315 --> 00:08:40,523
Oh, sorry.
Are you okay, Bender?

165
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:41,662
Shut up.

166
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,899
What difference
does it make?

167
00:08:42,968 --> 00:08:44,305
When that death-sphere
gets here,

168
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:46,547
we'll all be blown
to manwich meat.

169
00:08:46,616 --> 00:08:48,656
Well, I guess
it's time to indulge

170
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:50,899
in some end-of-the-world
debauchery.

171
00:08:50,966 --> 00:08:53,074
Who's up for an orgy?

172
00:08:56,488 --> 00:08:58,361
Maybe a parcheesi
tournament.

173
00:08:58,429 --> 00:09:00,370
Belay that parcheesi tournament.

174
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,081
I've identified
the death-sphere.

175
00:09:03,148 --> 00:09:06,494
We may yet have
a faint hope of survival.

176
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:09,339
Still, a parcheesi tournament.

177
00:09:09,406 --> 00:09:13,322
This is a top secret
military satellite

178
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,267
launched by the
air force in 1998.

179
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:20,117
And this is a top
secret FCC  satellite

180
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,923
launched that same year

181
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:24,401
to censor indecent
TV programs.

182
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:26,910
Like The Pimpsons
and Ass-o-rama?

183
00:09:26,978 --> 00:09:28,315
Precisely.

184
00:09:28,383 --> 00:09:30,893
However, the satellites collided
shortly after launch

185
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,102
and were never heard from again.

186
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,473
I found the board!

187
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:36,247
Now I've simulated
that collision

188
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:38,323
using shrapnel-vision.

189
00:09:43,645 --> 00:09:45,485
V-giny!

190
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,427
Granted, all that makes
perfect sense.

191
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:50,171
But why is this death-sphere
destroying planets?

192
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:52,347
That makes
the most sense of all.

193
00:09:52,413 --> 00:09:55,157
Lookt the planets
it's destroyed so far.

194
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:59,240
First came X-3 the
nude beach planet,

195
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:01,416
then Poopiter,

196
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:03,992
and finally that world
that can't be mentioned

197
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,001
in polite company.

198
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:07,341
You mean...

199
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:08,913
How dare you.

200
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:11,087
So the death-sphere

201
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:14,133
is "censoring"
indecent planets?

202
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:15,607
Indeed, and we're next,

203
00:10:15,675 --> 00:10:18,284
if we can't keep it in
our collective pants.

204
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:21,397
Our sole hope is to persuade
the people of earth

205
00:10:21,465 --> 00:10:23,806
to abandon their
smutty ways.

206
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:27,488
So the orgy's off?

207
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,165
So thirsty.

208
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:33,613
Why couldn't a water fountain
have fallen on me?

209
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,654
I couldn't find any
water, but the moisture

210
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:38,432
in these fruit-nut-berries
should sustain you.

211
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:40,473
Thank you.

212
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:43,385
I climbed perilously high
into the trees to pick them,

213
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:46,466
yet I saw no sign
of intelligent life.

214
00:10:46,532 --> 00:10:47,670
Bummer.

215
00:10:47,738 --> 00:10:48,874
Moreover, the crash

216
00:10:48,942 --> 00:10:50,849
totally destroyed our ship.

217
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,259
So we're stuck here
until someone finds us?

218
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:55,066
Alas, that may
never happen.

219
00:10:55,135 --> 00:10:58,011
Stealth technology makes the
ship impossible to locate,

220
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,220
yet easy to stub
your crotch on.

221
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:03,098
Well, there's worse places
to be marooned.

222
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:05,375
Plenty of food, mild climate.

223
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:08,185
I's a veritable garden of eden.

224
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:10,127
It is?

225
00:11:15,282 --> 00:11:16,618
Hello.

226
00:11:16,688 --> 00:11:17,991
Did that snake say hello?

227
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:20,735
No. We're both delirious
from dehydration.

228
00:11:20,803 --> 00:11:23,313
Just like
Adam and Eve.

229
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,739
We can still save Earth.

230
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:31,948
People are sure
to clean up their act

231
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:34,157
when presented
with cold, hard facts

232
00:11:34,224 --> 00:11:36,500
by rational folks like us.

233
00:11:37,672 --> 00:11:39,244
The end is near!

234
00:11:39,311 --> 00:11:41,285
Repent thy sins!

235
00:11:41,354 --> 00:11:42,625
I'll thinks it overs

236
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:45,100
while I engages
is five-dollar hooker.

237
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:47,409
Don't do it!
It's not worth it!

238
00:11:47,478 --> 00:11:49,116
Okay, make it three dollars.

239
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:52,398
Yuck! I don't wants
no three-dollar hooker.

240
00:11:52,466 --> 00:11:55,476
I'm going backs
to the adults bookstore.

241
00:11:55,543 --> 00:11:56,714
Adult bookstore?

242
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,488
I thought this was
the public library.

243
00:11:58,555 --> 00:12:01,299
No. Pubic library.

244
00:12:01,368 --> 00:12:03,810
Zapp? Where are you?

245
00:12:03,878 --> 00:12:07,022
Oh, God, I'm actually
starting to miss him.

246
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:09,366
Maybe you two
belong together.

247
00:12:09,434 --> 00:12:11,775
We do not.
And you can't talk.

248
00:12:11,843 --> 00:12:12,846
Oh, come on.

249
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:15,423
It must be
an awful temptation.

250
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,335
Guess who just killed a
woodchuck with his bare feet?

251
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:22,418
I thought I'd whip
us up some shelter.

252
00:12:22,486 --> 00:12:24,226
Make this a little
more like home.

253
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:26,132
I do miss
the Earth terribly.

254
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:28,543
I wonder if it's
even still there?

255
00:12:28,612 --> 00:12:30,585
Let's find out together.
I'll brave

256
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:33,930
the ship's wreckage to
fetch you the telescope.

257
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,672
That's so sweet.

258
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:37,948
I'm just sayin', is all.

259
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,473
I know my new plan
is a long shot,

260
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,581
but it's the
only hope left.

261
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,958
Well, now
I've heard everything.

262
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:58,196
On my iPod.

263
00:12:58,264 --> 00:12:59,736
So, do you have a new plan,
Professor?

264
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:01,375
And is there any hope left?

265
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:05,526
Indeed. We're here on
Earth's last unspoiled acre

266
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:06,864
to show the death-sphere

267
00:13:06,932 --> 00:13:09,273
there's still purity
in the world.

268
00:13:09,342 --> 00:13:11,080
Begin transmitting.

269
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:14,997
Commence purity chant.

270
00:13:20,822 --> 00:13:22,761
Hey, I'm proud of you, Bender...

271
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,670
avoiding sin
for almost a full minute.

272
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:26,075
Bender?

273
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,489
Oh yeah, baby,
you're quite a dish.

274
00:13:31,663 --> 00:13:33,002
Oh, yeah.

275
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:35,178
Oh, no. Oh, yeah.
Ooh!

276
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,722
- Oh, no.
- Bender, stop!

277
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,960
Stop!

278
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,434
Eh, quiet your riot.

279
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,315
What's the worst
that could happen?

280
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:55,795
No... no!

281
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,108
Earth is gone!

282
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:02,489
We're the only two humans
left in the universe!

283
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:06,872
Oh, God, I'm sorry, Leela.

284
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,220
Maybe... maybe
this was meant to be.

285
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:13,600
Maybe you and I were meant
to build a new world here.

286
00:14:13,668 --> 00:14:15,841
We can avoid
humanity's mistakes.

287
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,013
Like the tuba.

288
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:18,219
Yes!

289
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:19,792
We'll be like
Adam and Eve.

290
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,097
Only without the tuba.

291
00:14:21,165 --> 00:14:22,937
And we'll beget
little Zapp junior.

292
00:14:23,005 --> 00:14:24,209
And Leela junior.

293
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:26,117
And they'll have kids
of their own.

294
00:14:26,184 --> 00:14:28,894
Yuck! Is that really
what happened in the Bible?

295
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:31,874
It's a sick and twisted book
of holiness, all right.

296
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:33,546
Then we'll write our own Bible.

297
00:14:33,615 --> 00:14:36,593
With less Sodom
and more Gomorrah.

298
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,864
Let's do it.

299
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:40,274
I shall become the
mother of a new world,

300
00:14:40,342 --> 00:14:42,149
trapped here,
under this tree.

301
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:43,855
The tree of knowledge.

302
00:14:43,922 --> 00:14:46,130
Look, it even has apples!

303
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:48,741
Ow! Wow!

304
00:14:50,383 --> 00:14:51,754
Come here, Adam.

305
00:14:51,822 --> 00:14:54,263
Partake of my
forbidden fruit.

306
00:14:54,331 --> 00:14:56,372
Thee will be done.

307
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:07,224
Wait. One more bite
before we begin the begetting.

308
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,436
Mmm. Juicy.

309
00:15:10,505 --> 00:15:12,613
Those nut-berries
you found were so salty,

310
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,821
I couldn't think straight.

311
00:15:16,494 --> 00:15:19,841
I mean, not to belabor it,
but they were as salty

312
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:22,485
as that bag of trail mix
Fry gave me.

313
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:24,526
Exactly as salty.

314
00:15:24,594 --> 00:15:26,937
Hey! Wait a second!

315
00:15:27,005 --> 00:15:28,376
Uh...

316
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:30,718
Oh...

317
00:15:32,827 --> 00:15:36,242
I have a terrible
confession to make.

318
00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:39,487
You see, when I first
went foraging,

319
00:15:39,555 --> 00:15:40,960
what I actually found

320
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:43,101
was the smoldering wreckage
of the ship.

321
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:45,109
Ignoring all danger, I charged

322
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:48,055
inside to liberate
our provisions.

323
00:15:48,123 --> 00:15:50,431
So this is the trail mix
Fry gave me!

324
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:54,883
Yes. I exaggerated when I said
I picked it from the treetops.

325
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:56,656
I just wanted
you to think...

326
00:15:56,725 --> 00:15:59,400
A little better of me.

327
00:15:59,469 --> 00:16:01,978
Well... your motives were good.

328
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,090
And we were both loopy
from dehydration.

329
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,530
Hey, wait.

330
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,772
You've been doing
an awful lot of urinating.

331
00:16:10,814 --> 00:16:12,286
There's plenty of water.

332
00:16:12,353 --> 00:16:14,093
You see,

333
00:16:14,161 --> 00:16:16,269
after I selflessly rescued
the trail mix,

334
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:19,816
i braved the flames once more,
in search of fluids.

335
00:16:26,344 --> 00:16:27,848
Then why didn't you give me any?

336
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,827
I thought it might
help you forget

337
00:16:30,896 --> 00:16:34,241
your intense hatred for me if
you were a teensy bit delirious.

338
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,384
So you let me dehydrate

339
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,157
while you washed down
the trail mix

340
00:16:38,225 --> 00:16:40,064
with imported mineral water?

341
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:43,044
Not exactly.

342
00:16:43,112 --> 00:16:44,952
You see, besides the trail mix,

343
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:47,628
the minibar also contained
doritos, beef jerky,

344
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:50,741
and a generous assortment
of fine chocolates.

345
00:16:52,115 --> 00:16:53,854
I wanted to offer you
the chocolates...

346
00:16:53,922 --> 00:16:57,569
I truly did... but I was
concerned about your waistline.

347
00:16:57,635 --> 00:16:58,873
Very concerned.

348
00:16:58,942 --> 00:17:00,915
It's because
I haven't been exercising.

349
00:17:00,984 --> 00:17:04,396
If only this tree hadn't
fallen on me by chance.

350
00:17:04,463 --> 00:17:06,671
Oh, dear God!

351
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:12,595
It was just after we crashed.

352
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,207
I awoke first,
to find you trapped.

353
00:17:15,274 --> 00:17:16,679
Leela!

354
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:18,821
Leela, wake up.

355
00:17:31,172 --> 00:17:33,681
You could've moved this
grub-infested log

356
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:35,154
any time you wanted?

357
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,860
Well, sure...

358
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:39,605
But then I wouldn't have been
able to provide the loving care

359
00:17:39,673 --> 00:17:41,412
you wouldn't have needed.

360
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,131
I'd leave you to rot
in this paradise,

361
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,039
if only the ship
weren't destroyed.

362
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:51,319
The ship's fully
functional, isn't it?

363
00:17:54,064 --> 00:17:55,971
You see, after re-trapping you

364
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:58,046
and before feigning
unconsciousness,

365
00:17:58,115 --> 00:17:59,652
i paused to enjoy a cigar.

366
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:02,965
Though mellow and satisfying,
it did parch me a bit,

367
00:18:03,034 --> 00:18:04,739
so I went in search of Brandy.

368
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:06,882
That's when my keen
senses detected

369
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,124
the still-invisible ship.

370
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:10,597
Ow!

371
00:18:12,002 --> 00:18:13,909
So we can go back to Earth?

372
00:18:13,978 --> 00:18:17,022
But there is no
Earth anymore!

373
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,662
Everyone I know is dead!

374
00:18:20,538 --> 00:18:23,213
Ah, this seems like a good
place to take a dump.

375
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:26,327
Leela?! You're alive!

376
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:28,067
Fry!

377
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:31,314
But how did you
find this planet?

378
00:18:31,382 --> 00:18:33,054
Well?

379
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:36,803
We're actually on Earth.

380
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:38,878
The ship's homing device
brought us back.

381
00:18:38,945 --> 00:18:40,718
But I saw Earth explode.

382
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,931
I'm actually kind of proud
of this one.

383
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,438
You see, what you saw

384
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:47,915
was merely a simulation
I rigged up,

385
00:18:47,981 --> 00:18:50,791
using the ship's holographic
targeting projector.

386
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:54,040
The alleged "telescope"
was a toilet paper tube.

387
00:18:54,106 --> 00:18:56,648
You said there wasn't
any toilet paper!

388
00:18:56,717 --> 00:18:58,858
And that humanity was
annihilated!

389
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:00,397
My motives were pure.

390
00:19:00,465 --> 00:19:03,007
I just wanted to you to think
we had to save humanity

391
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:04,616
so you'd be willing
to have sex.

392
00:19:04,682 --> 00:19:06,355
Please say you believe me.

393
00:19:06,422 --> 00:19:08,698
Yes, I believe you.

394
00:19:08,765 --> 00:19:10,103
Hee-ya!

395
00:19:11,544 --> 00:19:13,384
Yay!

396
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:16,397
There must be something to
steal on this island.

397
00:19:16,463 --> 00:19:17,768
Hey, it's Leela.

398
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:21,114
Let's go home, everybody.

399
00:19:21,182 --> 00:19:23,222
At least the world
wasn't destroyed.

400
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,101
Yet.

401
00:19:29,883 --> 00:19:31,221
People of Earth!

402
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:34,769
Hear the righteous word
of the mighty V-giny!

403
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:36,510
The mighty V-giny!

404
00:19:37,547 --> 00:19:38,652
Seeing you frolic

405
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:40,927
in this unspoiled garden

406
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:43,974
gives hope that this world
may yet be redeemed.

407
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:47,788
Huzzah!
The purity chant worked!

408
00:19:47,856 --> 00:19:50,935
Unacceptable wardrobe
malfunction!

409
00:19:51,004 --> 00:19:53,411
I was referring
to Adam and Eve!

410
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:54,782
We're not Adam and Eve.

411
00:19:54,851 --> 00:19:56,657
You see, due to a series of...

412
00:19:56,726 --> 00:20:00,407
Consummate your union,
or I shall destroy Earth.

413
00:20:02,683 --> 00:20:05,092
Well... if it's to
save Earth...

414
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,668
I guess I could
take one for the team.

415
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:09,778
Uh, what? Right now?!

416
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:11,819
But I need a romance first.

417
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:13,995
Maybe a vanilla candle
or something?

418
00:20:14,061 --> 00:20:15,835
Commence intercourse!

419
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:19,984
Those giant guns are
making me feel sort
of inadequate.

420
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:21,625
I'm not sure if I can...

421
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:24,268
Move it. I gotta get
home and do laundry.

422
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:30,461
For God's sake, censor it!
Censor it!

423
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:32,904
Approved for all audiences!

424
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:34,476
No!

425
00:20:41,305 --> 00:20:43,748
And now,
the spicy finale of...

426
00:20:47,363 --> 00:20:50,140
That was a close call,
but we saved Earth.

427
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,486
Was it as good for you as
it was for the human race?

428
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:54,792
Oh, Zapp.

429
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:58,307
Let's save another
planet right now!

430
00:21:02,824 --> 00:21:06,305
