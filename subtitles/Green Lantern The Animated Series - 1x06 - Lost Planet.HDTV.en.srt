<b>1x06 - Lost Planet</b>

2
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:08,383
<i>Previously on Green Lantern...</i>

3
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:10,677
Those power rings are
currently in search of new hosts

4
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,679
or en route back to Oa.

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,306
Once I found out Dulac was dead,

6
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,225
I knew his ring would go
to the most worthy person.

7
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,976
Now that you're a Green Lantern,

8
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:21,021
will you join us in our fight
against the Red Lanterns?

9
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,695
All right, you jackwagons,
sound off like you mean it.

10
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,989
- Aya.
- Present.

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,033
- Razer.
- Heh.

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,410
Jordan. Jordan!

13
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:39,706
Whoa. Kilowog, there are only
four of us, and we're all here.

14
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,125
We may be a half a universe
away from Oa,

15
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,628
but that doesn't mean we can't
maintain a little discipline.

16
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,171
Discipline's overrated.

17
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:49,758
And I called this meeting
so we could assess our situation.

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,219
Easy. We'll be dead
within a month.

19
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,639
How about we leave the tactical
analysis to sergeant Kilowog.

20
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,599
[sighs]
That's right.

21
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,602
We're in deep umtec splat.

22
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,062
Just when things look
a little hopeful,

23
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,356
we lose our newfound
Green Lantern Iolande,

24
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,650
'cause she won't leave home.

25
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,736
So it's two Green Lanterns fighting
the entire Red Lantern invasion.

26
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,489
Pardon my interruption,
but I've completed my search

27
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,575
for the late Shyir Rev's
power ring.

28
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,660
There is good news
and there is bad news.

29
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,245
Let's have good news.

30
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,581
The ring's signal
emanates from a nearby planet.

31
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,292
Outstanding. Must have found
a replacement G.L.

32
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,752
Could be another recruit for us.
Change course immediately.

33
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:29,882
<i>I know I'm going to regret
asking, but what's the bad news?</i>

34
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:35,929
The planet in question will be hit
by that asteroid in 5.2 minutes.

35
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,687
I say we blow that
thing apart before it hits.

36
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,564
Due to the asteroid's
huge mass,

37
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,650
My canons will have no impact,
even at full power.

38
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:52,029
Maybe we don't need to destroy it.
We just need to slow it down.

39
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:08,045
Asteroid bearing unchanged.
I cannot maintain this level of output.

40
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,713
What about our personal lanterns?

41
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,507
Can you siphon
an extra boost from them?

42
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,467
Affirmative. Accessing.

43
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,267
It's working!

44
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,353
Power drum at critical level.

45
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,647
- Shut it down.
- No, keep firing!

46
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,065
Field regulations, Jordan.

47
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,067
We don't let our batteries
dip below 20%!

48
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:33,237
Enough with the regulations!
Keep pouring it on!

49
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,863
[groans]

50
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,242
[cracking]

51
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:45,999
Main and portable batteries
nearing failure threshold.

52
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,556
<i>Talk to me, Aya.
Did we do it?</i>

53
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,601
Asteroid progress delayed.
We now have six hours until impact.

54
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,145
Yeah, great.
We blew all our power doing it.

55
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:10,232
Now when we go down there,
our rings will be running on fumes.

56
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,317
No one will mind that our
rings are only partially charged

57
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,278
as we rescue them.

58
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:18,657
Scanners now at limited capacity,
reading few scattered life forms.

59
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,158
Looks like we have six hours to find

60
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,827
the new Green Lantern
recruit down there

61
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,413
and get him and any others
off the planet in one piece.

62
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:27,624
Shooting from the hip as
usual. Gonna get us all killed.

63
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:32,171
Jordan, regulations exist for a reason.
They're not suggestions.

64
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:34,506
And since we're at war,
we should follow them!

65
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,260
I concur. Putting the lives of two
well-trained Green Lanterns at risk

66
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,722
in an effort to save one
untrained novice, is impractical.

67
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,682
Look, I may not have followed
all the regs to the letter,

68
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,518
but there are people on that
planet who need to be rescued,

69
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,562
not to mention a Green Lantern.

70
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,356
And one Green Lantern
can make all the difference.

71
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,786
So, which way?

72
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,789
A strange seismic interference
is disrupting the scanner's ability

73
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:12,085
to pinpoint the ring's exact location.
But it is in this vicinity.

74
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:16,393
Then let's move.

75
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,938
We come in peace.

76
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:34,358
- I've always wanted to say that.
- Why?

77
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,109
Greetings, travelers.

78
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,529
You are well met on this
desolate rock of a planet.

79
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,030
I am Zartok.

80
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,991
My fellow castaways
are Drusa and Grood.

81
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,369
I'm Hal Jordan.

82
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,955
This is Kilowog, Aya and Razer.

83
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,623
Where did your ship crash?

84
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:53,836
We didn't crash.
We landed just over that rise.

85
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,090
That, what you're holding,
is a Thalian moon staff.

86
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:01,927
Only soldiers that fought in the last
stand of Thalius Prime wielded that blade.

87
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,763
I know.
I was in that battle.

88
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,598
We're looking
for a Green Lantern, here.

89
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,601
A search, I want to point out,
that is pathetic and pointless.

90
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,397
Look around you.
There's no Green Lantern here.

91
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:17,776
Oh, ok, we should just give up.
Or we could look for ourselves.

92
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,653
That asteroid's going to hit
in six hours.

93
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,947
We'll get you to safety
before that happens,

94
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,492
but in the meantime, we could use
some help finding our Green Lantern.

95
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,452
You will have our aid.

96
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,745
We'll split into teams.

97
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,038
We can cover
more ground that way.

98
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,498
I'll go with Zartok.

99
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:35,252
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go with Aya.

100
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,297
Nice to talk with another...
girl for a change.

101
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:42,050
Must be losing
my game out here.

102
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,097
I work better alone.

103
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:52,561
Oh. Well, I guess
it's just you and me, pal.

104
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,654
So, Grood...

105
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,449
I bet you're like
a senator on your planet.

106
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,951
A great orator,
a voice to be heard.

107
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,746
No, no, no, wait,
you're a storyteller

108
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,831
who weaves a magic
tapestry of words,

109
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:16,210
charming everyone around with
your ingenious turn of phrase.

110
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,513
What is it?
Did you find something?

111
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,809
I-- I don't see anything.
What is it I'm supposed to--

00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,854
[groaning and grunting]

113
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,365

116
00:06:59,582 --> 00:07:03,461
Ok.
That doesn't make any sense.

117
00:07:03,545 --> 00:07:06,631
Hello? Anyone?
Come in!

118
00:07:06,715 --> 00:07:09,884
Maybe this was a really
bad idea after all.

119
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:13,847
I've been working with
grunts and posers for so long.

120
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,182
It's an honor to be
in the company of a soldier--

121
00:07:16,224 --> 00:07:17,851
A true soldier.

122
00:07:17,976 --> 00:07:21,521
So your leader, Hal Jordan,
disappoints you?

123
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:23,523
Hal ain't exactly my leader.

124
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:27,652
In fact, I'm not even sure he's got
the right stuff to lead this war.

125
00:07:27,694 --> 00:07:31,072
But the defenders
of Thalius Prime are legendary.

126
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:33,283
If it wouldn't be too rude to ask,

127
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:37,370
I would love to hear of the battle--
the last stand.

128
00:07:37,412 --> 00:07:38,663
It was...

129
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:44,210
The greatest moment of my life.
A glorious battle.

130
00:07:44,294 --> 00:07:48,006
Never have I seen such bravery,
such soldierly duty.

131
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:49,841
The cartonian hordes
were terrifying--

132
00:07:49,883 --> 00:07:52,677
murder in the eyes
and thirsting for blood.

133
00:07:52,802 --> 00:07:55,930
A good day to die.

134
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:02,604
I've been marooned on this
planet for quite some time.

135
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:04,689
It's so exciting to see you--

136
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:07,984
A walking, talking
artificial intelligence.

137
00:08:08,026 --> 00:08:11,196
Such technology.
Such perfection.

138
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,739
Perfection is incorrect.

139
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:18,286
I must continually adjust
a 0,0001% flaw in my programming.

140
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:21,373
Well, you sure sound
perfect to-- oh, ahh!

[groaning]

142
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:27,545
Ohh. Stupid.
I twisted it.

143
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:31,591
I can construct a field dressing
and splint from surrounding materials.

144
00:08:31,716 --> 00:08:33,385
I'd feel better if you took me back

145
00:08:33,385 --> 00:08:35,220
to your ship for medical attention.

146
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:37,764
Certainly.

147
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,272

149
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:57,826
Don't turn your back on me!

[birds chirping]

151
00:09:09,254 --> 00:09:11,464
Hold it right there, Grood.

152
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:26,312
Whoa!

153
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,361
There was much blood.
Many lives lost.

154
00:09:33,403 --> 00:09:36,531
But my battalion
still had fight in 'em.

155
00:09:36,573 --> 00:09:39,200
My personal guards stood
with me in the thick of battle.

156
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:42,370
The Cardonian horde were
ruthless and relentless.

157
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:45,874
That Thalian moon staff has probably
seen more action than any of us.

158
00:09:45,915 --> 00:09:48,710
It has earned its place in history.

159
00:09:48,752 --> 00:09:51,463
To be honest, we're here
looking for a ring.

160
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:55,592
It can be tried to choose one of you to be
a Green Lantern, like us.

161
00:09:57,093 --> 00:09:59,888
Personally, I'm hoping it's you.

162
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:04,017
Such power would be
a great honor.

163
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:11,232
This ship is more than my home.

164
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:12,776
I have never known anything else.

165
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:16,279
It is correct to state
that I was born on this ship.

166
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:20,867
- Is this the infirmary?
- That, and numerous other uses.

167
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:22,911
There is not sufficient space
on the ship,

168
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:25,914
so each room serves multiple functions.

169
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,086
What's this?

170
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:34,422
That is the main access panel
to my CPU chamber.

171
00:10:34,506 --> 00:10:37,092
Perfect.

172
00:10:52,023 --> 00:10:58,780
A graveyard of space wrecks.
Rashe pirate ships.

173
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:00,657
War ships of the Cardonian horde.

174
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:03,702
Yes. And those are space
clippers of the Tarconian marauders.

175
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:06,705
Who are you?!
One of the castaways?

176
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,750
Those over there are catty slavers
from Gur. Quite the collection.

177
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:14,337
All of them seriouy bad people
who have done seriously bad things.

178
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:17,048
Tell me who you are,
or so help me...

179
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:19,175
The path they walked
led to their doom.

180
00:11:19,217 --> 00:11:21,386
It is the same path you travel now.

181
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:24,055
I am Saint Walker.
And you are?

182
00:11:24,097 --> 00:11:26,349
About to kick your smug rear.

183
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:28,977
That is not a very pleasant name.
Not in the least.

184
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:32,897
- You got a problem with me?
- Do you have a problem with you?

185
00:11:33,022 --> 00:11:36,985
I only have one problem,
but it's a problem I intend to correct.

186
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:39,696
[grunts]

187
00:11:39,738 --> 00:11:42,032
Come in.
Can anyone hear me?

188
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:45,452
How am I going to warn
the others if I can't find them?

189
00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:54,169
Ok...
Well, it's a stretch,

190
00:11:54,294 --> 00:11:57,672
but it's a better lead
than anything else I've got.

191
00:11:57,714 --> 00:12:01,468
And the great battle
of Thalius Prime was over.

192
00:12:01,593 --> 00:12:03,428
What an inspiration.

193
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,015
And what an honor to hear about
it in your words, Zartok.

194
00:12:07,098 --> 00:12:10,643
We would have won if my
battalion hadn't been captured.

195
00:12:10,643 --> 00:12:15,106
You did win! The Cardonian
horde was defeated that day.

196
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,858
Precisely.

197
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:21,112
Because my battalion
was the Cardonian horde.

198
00:12:21,196 --> 00:12:23,239
And I was their general!

199
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:27,660
[grunting]

200
00:12:36,753 --> 00:12:38,880
Taste the power of my rage!

201
00:12:38,922 --> 00:12:43,176
Rage has no real power,
or taste, for that matter.

202
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:45,303
[grunting]

203
00:12:45,303 --> 00:12:48,515
It's the orphan
child of fear and despair.

204
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,975
[grunting]

205
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:03,029
Moon staff.

206
00:13:03,154 --> 00:13:05,740
Only the defenders of Thalius
Prime carry that weapon.

207
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:09,452
Yes. And I personally pried
this one from the cold hands

208
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:12,956
of one of their fallen soldiers
as a trophy.

209
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:15,458
Ahhh!

210
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:23,007
Your kicks need work.

211
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:25,301
A little higher
at the knee, I think.

212
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,478
Speaking of taste, though,

213
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,313
you really should
try this melon, brother.

214
00:13:37,355 --> 00:13:40,108
Very sweet.

215
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:41,818
[grunting]

216
00:13:41,901 --> 00:13:44,237
You don't deserve
to wield that staff.

217
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,406
You're supposed to be a soldier.

218
00:13:46,531 --> 00:13:49,284
How could you destroy such
good people as the Thalians?

219
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:52,620
They were brave warriors
that stood with honor!

220
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:54,831
I massacred them
because they were weak.

221
00:13:54,873 --> 00:13:57,500
[both grunting]

222
00:14:00,962 --> 00:14:03,214
My soldiers
followed orders perfectly,

223
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:05,258
with unquestioning loyalty!

224
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:08,053
[both grunting]

225
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:15,894
If you were truly a soldier,

226
00:14:15,977 --> 00:14:17,854
you would know that blind loyalty

227
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:21,524
is far better than honor or bravery!

228
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:24,152
[grunting]

229
00:14:35,538 --> 00:14:37,791
[gasping]

230
00:14:41,336 --> 00:14:44,005
Sit still so I can hit you!

231
00:14:44,047 --> 00:14:47,133
No, brother.
You sit still.

232
00:14:47,258 --> 00:14:50,637
[groaning]

233
00:14:50,678 --> 00:14:52,680
There's a storm coming, brother.

234
00:14:52,764 --> 00:14:56,101
And the galaxy will need everyone
of strong and true heart to survive.

235
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:58,812
What in the name of Grotz
are you talking about?!

236
00:14:58,937 --> 00:15:01,481
Your anger and rage
may lead to your doom.

237
00:15:01,523 --> 00:15:04,984
Personally, I think
you should avoid that.

238
00:15:05,068 --> 00:15:07,278
But there is always hope.

239
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,075
- You're the Green Lantern.
- No, not me.

240
00:15:13,827 --> 00:15:16,037
I travel a different path.

241
00:15:22,877 --> 00:15:24,963
Nice going, kid.

242
00:15:25,046 --> 00:15:27,549
- You found the ring.
- Actually...

243
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,093
Funny that the ring hasn't
chosen a Green Lantern yet.

244
00:15:30,218 --> 00:15:31,886
Maybe one of the castaways.

245
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,640
[chuckles] No, those castaways
are bad news, trust me.

246
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:38,893
We need to find the others
and get off this planet... now!

247
00:15:41,896 --> 00:15:44,190
[both grunting]

248
00:15:47,218 --> 00:15:52,432
Good fight, Kilowog.
It is a good ending.

249
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:54,934
[groaning]

[yelling and grunting]

251
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:08,531
No.
That's a good ending.

252
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:17,373
Luckily for you and your friends,
it is a very good day to die.

253
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,702
[console beeps]

254
00:16:30,744 --> 00:16:32,996
General, what about Grood?

255
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:34,998
Forget him.
We have his ship now.

256
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,791
Let's get off
this horrible rock.

257
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,919
I look forward to watching that
asteroid from a safe distance

258
00:16:40,003 --> 00:16:42,505
as it obliterates
this accursed planet.

259
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:46,801
[groans] I'll knock
that smile off his face.

260
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:57,312
Uh, Kilowog, is there a reason Aya's
flying off and leaving us?

261
00:16:57,353 --> 00:17:01,649
She's not.It's those castaways.
They stole the ship.

262
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,338
Unh!

263
00:17:27,175 --> 00:17:28,927
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

269
00:18:25,984 --> 00:18:27,694
Aya's back online.

270
00:18:27,736 --> 00:18:29,988
We're ready to blow this munktor stand!

271
00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:31,740
Jordan, now!

272
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:36,286
It doesn't make sense. Why did
the ring stay here on this planet

273
00:18:36,411 --> 00:18:38,538
and not go back to Oa?

274
00:18:38,621 --> 00:18:41,791
Go! Go back to Oa!

275
00:18:45,754 --> 00:18:47,839
It can't be.

276
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,761
Kilowog, take off now.
Right now.

277
00:18:52,886 --> 00:18:55,013
I have to stay behind.
There's something I have to do.

278
00:18:55,138 --> 00:18:56,598
Jordan, time's up.

279
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,017
The ring didn't find
a replacement. We gotta go!

280
00:18:59,142 --> 00:19:02,479
It did. Our hero's
been here the whole time.

281
00:19:04,022 --> 00:19:08,109
Get Aya and Razer off this planet.
Trust me.

282
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,536
I ordered you off this rock.
What are you doing?

283
00:19:18,578 --> 00:19:20,580
I'm disobeying orders.

284

<i>Thank you, Hal Jordan of Earth.</i>

286
00:20:03,331 --> 00:20:05,750
<i>You have saved me.</i>

00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:10,797
<i>Rather, by giving me the ring,
by knighting me,</i>

288
00:20:10,922 --> 00:20:15,802
<i>you allowed me the power
to save myself from that asteroid.</i>

289
00:20:15,844 --> 00:20:17,303
Our pleasure.

290

Very proud.</i>

<i>And I will be here
whenever you have need of me.</i>

00:20:49,544 --> 00:20:53,298
I gotta say, Jordan, you're
gathering one unorthodox team,

298
00:20:53,423 --> 00:20:55,925
but it's an honor to be a part of it.
