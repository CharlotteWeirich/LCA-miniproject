<i>and bring balance to the world.</i>

7
00:00:28,107 --> 00:00:30,745
<i>Amon's revolution grows stronger by the day:</i>

8
00:00:30,887 --> 00:00:32,677
<i>First he attacked the bending arena,</i>

9
00:00:32,742 --> 00:00:37,617
<i>Then, it was discovered that Hiroshi Sato was the
mastermind behind the Equalists gloves and mecha-tanks!</i>

10
00:00:37,744 --> 00:00:40,554
<i>And most recently, Amon ambushed Councilman Tarrlok,</i>

11
00:00:40,788 --> 00:00:43,551
<i>took his bending and nearly captured the Avatar as well.</i>

12
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:44,899
<i>Everyone is on edge,</i>

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,111
<i>wondering where will Amon strike next.</i>

14
00:00:48,144 --> 00:00:51,680
One Book: Air, Episode:10,
Turning the Tides.

15
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,522
Daddy, you're home,

16
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,162
we waited up for you.

17
00:01:26,598 --> 00:01:27,683
It's Korra ok?

18
00:01:27,718 --> 00:01:29,301
Yes, she's fine, sweetie.

19
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:33,650
I was scared, I thought she wasn't coming back.

20
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:35,488
I'm sorry you were scared,

21
00:01:35,717 --> 00:01:37,529
but everything is going to be fine now.

22
00:01:37,992 --> 00:01:38,895
I promise.

23
00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:49,059
The food tastes amazing, Pema.

24
00:01:49,748 --> 00:01:51,872
I'm finally starting to feel like myself again.

25
00:01:51,907 --> 00:01:54,006
We're so thankful you're home safe.

26
00:01:55,327 --> 00:01:55,938
Let me help.

27
00:01:56,635 --> 00:01:58,617
Korra, I realize you've been through a lot

28
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,342
but I need to know everything that happened.

29
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,171
Well...first of...Tarrlok isn't who he says he is.

30
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:06,848
He's Yakone's son.

31
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,182
It all makes sense now.

32
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:12,730
That's how Tarrlok was able
to bloodbend us without a full moon.

33
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:15,414
But how did you escape? And where's Tarrlok?

34
00:02:15,546 --> 00:02:16,834
Amon captured him...

35
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:18,604
and took his bending.

36
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:19,311
What?

37
00:02:19,436 --> 00:02:21,546
Yeah, he showed up out of nowhere.

38
00:02:21,862 --> 00:02:23,145
He almost got me too.

39
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:25,324
This is very disturbing news.

40
00:02:25,742 --> 00:02:27,368
Amon is becoming emboldened

41
00:02:27,687 --> 00:02:30,515
taking out a councilman, almost capturing the Avatar.

44
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:45,097
The baby is... just kicking really hard, that's all. I'm fine.

45
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:46,572
Should I get Tenzin?

46
00:02:46,574 --> 00:02:48,975
No reason to worry him. It's nothing.

47
00:02:50,181 --> 00:02:52,947
Can I get some hot water? Korra needs more tea.

48
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:55,583
You're a firebender. Boil it yourself.

49
00:02:59,656 --> 00:03:03,091
I'm gonna step out in case you two want to talk.

50
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,787
Is there something we need to talk about?

51
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,903
I've noticed how you treat Korra.

52
00:03:12,494 --> 00:03:14,370
How you acted when she was missing.

53
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:16,330
You have feelings for her, don't you?

54
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:16,965
What?

55
00:03:17,468 --> 00:03:17,997
No.

56
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,511
She was taken by a crazy bloodbender.

57
00:03:20,514 --> 00:03:21,966
How did you expect me to act?

58
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:23,241
I like Korra,

59
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:26,494
but you've been keeping the truth from me this whole time.

60
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:27,498
The truth?

61
00:03:27,861 --> 00:03:28,909
About what?

62
00:03:28,982 --> 00:03:30,575
You're really going to make me say it?

63
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:33,160
Yes! Because I don't know what you're talking about.

64
00:03:33,205 --> 00:03:34,600
The kiss, Mako.

65
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:35,796
I know.

66
00:03:36,107 --> 00:03:36,560
I...

67
00:03:37,244 --> 00:03:37,769
What...?

68
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:41,204
Bolin told you, didn't he?

69
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,430
Don't blame your brother for what you did.

70
00:03:43,642 --> 00:03:45,678
Do you have feelings for Korra or not?

71
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:47,733
Look, things are crazy right now.

72
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:50,335
Can we deal with our relationship problems later?

73
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:53,089
Well, there might not be any relationship to worry about later.

74
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,246
Asami!

75
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,888
Lin, uh... I-I need to ask you a favor...

76
00:04:01,305 --> 00:04:02,849
It would mean the world to me,

77
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:07,802
but I-I know it could be a potentially awkward situation; furthermore-

78
00:04:07,804 --> 00:04:09,044
Spit it out, already!

79
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:12,416
Will you stay here and watch over Pema
and the children while I meet with the council?

80
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:14,192
With everything that's happened lately,

81
00:04:14,616 --> 00:04:17,104
I want to be sure my family is in safe hands.

82
00:04:17,947 --> 00:04:20,151
Of course I'll help, old friend.

83
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:22,996
I didn't realize you two were out here.

84
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:25,536
Pema! Y-Yes
Yes...

85
00:04:25,537 --> 00:04:28,821
Lin has agreed to help out around here
and keep an eye on things while I'm away.

86
00:04:28,983 --> 00:04:32,414
Thank you! I could use the extra pair of hands.

87
00:04:32,637 --> 00:04:34,479
Would you mind giving him a bath? He's filthy.

88
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,300
This is not what I signed on for!

89
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:40,325
Thank you, Lin!

90
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:41,517
Oogi, yip, yip.

91
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:49,886
I gotta poo!...Really bad!

92
00:04:58,955 --> 00:05:02,197
Do you know where my keys are? I can't find them anywhere!

93
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:03,402
No, dear.

94
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:05,341
Oh, found them!

95
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,377
Good, dear.

96
00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:10,762
Don't wait up for me, this council session
will probably go late into the night.

97
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,061
The door, dear.

98
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:18,960
We're here to fix a spider-rat problem.

99
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:20,911
I didn't call an exterminator.

100
00:05:25,518 --> 00:05:26,154
Dear?

101
00:06:11,112 --> 00:06:12,656
I'm so relieved to see you!

102
00:06:12,811 --> 00:06:14,819
The other council members. Are they all right?

103
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:16,086
I'm afraid not!

104
00:06:16,217 --> 00:06:18,292
I just received a call from Chief Saikhan.

105
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,639
They've all been captured!

106
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,701
This can't be happening.

107
00:06:22,277 --> 00:06:25,220
The leadership of Republic City is in your hands now.

108
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,019
It is a tragic day indeed!

109
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:47,631
Alright kids, time to go inside.

110
00:06:50,086 --> 00:06:51,873
We heard explosions. What's going on?

111
00:06:52,282 --> 00:06:53,838
Republic City is under attack.

112
00:07:06,517 --> 00:07:09,168
I've dreamed of this day for so long...

113
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:14,645
Yes, the time has come for the Equalists to claim Republic City...

114
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,010
as their own.

115
00:07:32,354 --> 00:07:33,845
Where did you say you parked the car?

116
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:35,688
It's right around here somewhere.

117
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:37,402
There it is.

118
00:07:41,173 --> 00:07:43,111
Wow! Nice parking job!

119
00:07:43,408 --> 00:07:46,685
Hey! You guys got arrested and left me alone with a car!

120
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,432
I made it very clear I don't know how to drive.

121
00:07:49,883 --> 00:07:51,677
All things considered you did a great job!

122
00:07:52,465 --> 00:07:54,874
But how are we going to pay for all of these parking tickets?

123
00:07:58,204 --> 00:07:59,944
Relax, the city is under attack.

124
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,211
The police have more important things to worry about.

125
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:06,120
This will come in handy.

126
00:08:10,372 --> 00:08:11,670
Why don't you sit in back?

127
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,187
With Korra?

128
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:15,323
I think I will.

129
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:22,723
Everything all right?

130
00:08:22,948 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah, everything is terrific...

131
00:08:25,758 --> 00:08:26,996
Car! Uh, you're good.

132
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:36,412
Chief! Air Unit Seven was just taken down by an Equalist airship,

133
00:08:36,477 --> 00:08:37,782
they've crashed into the harbor.

134
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,423
Send a River Rescue Unit.

135
00:08:39,508 --> 00:08:42,703
Chief! All River Rescue Ships have been sabotaged!

136
00:08:42,748 --> 00:08:43,259
What?

137
00:08:44,622 --> 00:08:45,443
Chief Saikhan.

138
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:47,183
Tenzin, am I glad to see you,

139
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:49,164
I was afraid you'd been captured too.

140
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:50,853
I am the only councilman they left.

141
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:52,077
What's the status?

142
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:55,046
Amon has launched simultaneous attacks across the boroughs,

143
00:08:55,047 --> 00:08:57,708
the police are trying to regain control, but we're spread too thin.

144
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,043
I need to send a wire.

145
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:02,330
To whom, Councilman?

146
00:09:02,591 --> 00:09:04,337
The General of the United Forces.

147
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:17,215
Councilman, your wire has been sent.

148
00:09:17,216 --> 00:09:19,019
Chief, the phone lines just went dead.

149
00:09:27,095 --> 00:09:27,610
Catch!

150
00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:33,743
Saikhan, defense!

151
00:09:39,604 --> 00:09:41,008
We need to evacuate immediately.

152
00:09:41,353 --> 00:09:42,600
Everyone stay close to me.

153
00:09:59,627 --> 00:10:01,147
Not this mecha-tanks again!

154
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:44,942
Saikhan... no...

155
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:12,122
Jump!

156
00:12:12,972 --> 00:12:13,493
Thank you.

157
00:12:29,691 --> 00:12:31,498
Tenzin has escaped once again.

158
00:12:32,303 --> 00:12:36,004
I can't stand to see Asami fighting along side those...benders.

159
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,241
We'll capture them before long,

160
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:40,414
and you will have your daughter back.

161
00:12:43,356 --> 00:12:44,367
Are you alright?

162
00:12:44,485 --> 00:12:45,043
I'm fine.

163
00:12:45,609 --> 00:12:46,421
Thank you, kids.

164
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,334
Another moment later and I would've been on my way to Amon.

165
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:50,667
Uh... guys...

166
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:51,690
Look!

167
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,215
Oh, no.

168
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,394
Everyone, hide inside and remain calm.

169
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:37,714
Pull it together, Pema! Didn't I just say remain calm?

170
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:39,335
Mommy, what's wrong?

171
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:41,327
The baby is coming!

172
00:13:42,774 --> 00:13:43,580
Oh, no!

173
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,247
Not now, baby!

174
00:14:48,516 --> 00:14:50,067
The children... where are they?

175
00:14:50,073 --> 00:14:52,890
Don't worry, they're in the other room, totally safe.

176
00:15:03,017 --> 00:15:05,600
Stay away from my dad's ex-girlfriend!

177
00:15:10,886 --> 00:15:12,903
Jinora, you shouldn't be out here!

178
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:16,369
Get off our island!

179
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:22,709
Girls, you need to go back inside this instant!

180
00:15:24,109 --> 00:15:25,766
Taste my fury!

181
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:30,096
Meelo, be careful!

182
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:40,215
Never mind.

183
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:45,466
Take these Equalists and lock them in the temple's basement.

184
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:47,116
Nice work, kids.

185
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:48,908
Dad!

186
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,342
Oh, thank goodness you're alright!

187
00:15:55,851 --> 00:15:57,588
We caught the bad guys.

188
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,143
You let them fight?

189
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,197
Do you realize what could have happened?

190
00:16:01,473 --> 00:16:03,766
I would have been toast if it weren't for your kids,

191
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:06,429
you should be proud, you taught them well.

192
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,195
Go on, be with your wife.

193
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:18,034
Pema!

194
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,084
Tenzin.

195
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:28,258
I'm here, Pema.

196
00:16:28,648 --> 00:16:29,958
Our new son.

197
00:16:37,048 --> 00:16:37,673
Hello.

198
00:16:40,612 --> 00:16:42,158
Come! Meet your new brother!

199
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,071
A brother? Well, it's about time!

200
00:16:47,153 --> 00:16:47,876
Welcome!

201
00:16:48,288 --> 00:16:50,432
I'm Ikki and this is Jinora and Meelo.

202
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:54,032
We have a super great family and
we're so happy that you're a part of it.

203
00:16:55,228 --> 00:16:56,452
What are you gonna name him?

204
00:16:57,152 --> 00:16:58,013
Can I pick?

205
00:16:58,229 --> 00:16:59,876
We already chose a name.

206
00:17:01,175 --> 00:17:01,826
Rohan.

207
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,093
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

208
00:17:11,294 --> 00:17:13,641
but... more airships are coming.

209
00:17:14,548 --> 00:17:16,251
I think it's not gonna be fine.

210
00:17:16,606 --> 00:17:17,472
Is it, daddy?

211
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,644
What do you wanna do, Tenzin?

212
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:39,110
I need to protect my family

213
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:41,473
and get them as far away from this conflict as possible.

214
00:17:41,835 --> 00:17:44,103
If Amon got his hands on my children...

215
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:46,025
I'd hate to even think of it.

216
00:17:46,173 --> 00:17:48,574
- If you're leaving, then I'm going with you.
- But-

217
00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:49,542
No arguments!

218
00:17:49,815 --> 00:17:51,970
You and your family are the last airbenders,

219
00:17:52,216 --> 00:17:55,286
there's no way in the world that
I'm letting Amon take your bending away.

220
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:56,515
Thank you, Lin.

221
00:17:57,014 --> 00:18:00,745
Korra, I want you to leave this island
and hide for the time being.

222
00:18:01,105 --> 00:18:02,181
I'm not giving up.

223
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,588
I'm not asking you to.

224
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:07,093
I sent word to the United Forces, they will be here soon.

225
00:18:07,498 --> 00:18:10,024
And once my family is safe, I will return

226
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,216
with the reinforcements, we can turn the tide in this war.

227
00:18:13,762 --> 00:18:15,032
What you're saying is...

228
00:18:15,689 --> 00:18:16,826
we need to be patient.

229
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:19,869
You're learning well.

230
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:29,254
Stay safe, Korra.

231
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,164
You too.

232
00:18:30,504 --> 00:18:32,949
Tenzin, if we're leaving, we better do it now.

233
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:37,065
Oogi, yip, yip.

234
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,773
Go! We'll hold them off!

235
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:13,488
Everyone! Come on!

236
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,818
Let's go, girl.

237
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:31,798
Who's that guy?

238
00:19:42,322 --> 00:19:43,349
Nice work, Naga.

239
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,365
They're gaining on us!

240
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,168
Faster, Oogi!

241
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,747
Whatever happens to me, don't turn back.

242
00:20:27,482 --> 00:20:28,485
Lin, what are you doing?

243
00:21:32,814 --> 00:21:35,417
That lady is my hero.

244
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,460
Yes, she is.

245
00:21:49,221 --> 00:21:51,112
Korra, we should get moving.

246
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:15,038
Tell me where the Avatar is

247
00:22:15,214 --> 00:22:17,076
and I'll let you keep your bending.

248
00:22:17,185 --> 00:22:20,019
I won't tell you anything, you monster.

249
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:21,257
Very well.

250
00:22:40,664 --> 00:22:43,213
General! I just received a wire from the Avatar!

251
00:22:43,477 --> 00:22:46,301
She says Amon and his forces have gained control of the city,

252
00:22:46,846 --> 00:22:48,120
How do you want to respond?

253
00:22:50,183 --> 00:22:52,223
Tell her we'll be arriving in three days time

254
00:22:52,712 --> 00:22:55,018
and that I look forward to winning back Republic City...

255
00:22:55,113 --> 00:22:55,732
Together.

256
00:22:56,304 --> 00:22:58,317
As you wish, General Iroh.
