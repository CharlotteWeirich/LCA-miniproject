Who are these people?

They are kings and queens.

57
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,734
The leaders of the other
four human kingdoms.

58
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:59,113
Then we will have to get their attention.

00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,912
[Claudia] So... Ezran, why are you here?

60
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,249
- And by yourself?
- [Ezran] I found out something.

61
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,294
My dad...

62
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,089
That's okay.

63
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,549
You don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

64
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,847
I know it's not the same, but...

65
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,268
when I was a kid, my mom and dad split up.

66
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,938
I remember hearing them
fight a lot at night

67
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,481
after we went to bed.

68
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,108
And then one day,

69
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,612
they told us Mom was moving back
to Del Bar, where her family was from.

70
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,572
And then they said...

71
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,491
we had to choose.

72
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,620
<i>And Soren chose Dad.</i>

73
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:52,000
How could I choose? How could I do that?

74
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:56,004
Then my mom looked at my dad,
and she told me to stay.

75
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,342
She said I had to stay with Soren,
that this was my home,

76
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,469
and my brother and I needed each other.

77
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,805
And then she left.

78
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,308
But how could she do that?

79
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,351
Why would she leave you?

80
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,896
I think she needed to leave for herself.

81
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,233
To be happy... somehow.

82
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,986
You might have noticed
my dad is pretty intense.

83
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,864
You must miss her.

84
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,909
Losing her has been the hardest thing
that's ever happened to me.

[Ezran] When you grow up,

86
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,997
sometimes there are changes
you don't expect,

87
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,875
and you have to face things
you're not ready for.

88
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,211
Callum told me that.

89
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,465
You are so lucky
to have a brother like Callum.

90
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,340

00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:15,083
Ezran, you don't just have a way
with animals...

99
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,794
you can talk to them, can't you?

100
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,422
Yes. I can talk to them.

101
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,427
I need you to help me
find something in the forest.

102
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:31,015
If I can find milk-fruit,
maybe I can help Soren.

115
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,048
Sometimes you just need to focus
on the present,

116
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,051
take a deep breath and just be.

Callum!

[Sarai] Sometimes things
can get so complicated

that our minds
can't quite sort them out alone.

But when you slow down
and let yourself breathe,

your spirit and your body
can catch up with your mind, and help out.

To know something truly and deeply,

129
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:46,215
you must know it with your head,
hand, and heart.

Mind, body, and spirit.

You're even looking cheery.

And is that a twinkle in your eye?

139
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,499
Oh, no. That's not a twinkle,
it's one of those sleep crusties.

- Here, let me...

I understand the sky arcanum.

This is where the squirrel said
we should go.

There, I see it.

A milk-fruit bush.

00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,315
Look, Claudia!
There's a family of deer here.

146

I almost forgot how deer love milk-fruit!

147

Yes. Yes, they do.

148
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,575
Callum needs you.
Do you know the way back?

149
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,994
I've got plenty of friends to help me
if I get lost.

150
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,080
I'm so sorry.

151
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:03,501
I'm sorry if the things I did before
were frightening or confusing.

I care about you and Callum a lot.

[Rayla] You understand
the sky arcanum now?

156

It's not one simple thing.
It's all the things.

157
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,650
They just had to... come together,
you know?

158
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,654
It's like, I used to hold
the power of the sky in my hand, right?

159
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,905
But now that's gone.

160
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:37,326
But, Rayla, the whole world
is like a giant primal stone,

161
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,078
and we're inside it!

I'm inside sky magic,

00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,876
but it's also in me,
with every breath I take.

164
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,045
[breathing deeply]

165
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,715
That kind of makes sense!

166
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,385
Yes! And I kept thinking about birds,
and sails,

167
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,886
and how they connect to the wind.

168
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,764
And I thought I had to find my wings...

169
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,182
but that's just it,

170
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,768
I am the wing!

171
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,814
That makes less sense... but okay!

172
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,402
Moment of truth.

173
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,989
Let's see if I can really do this.

174
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,453
[exhales]

175
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:31,464
[inhales and exhales]

00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,895
[inhales]

177
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,232
<i>Aspiro.</i>

178
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,158
Ezran, you're back!

179
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,414
He was gone?

180
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,809
- [Zym chirps]
- [Ezran grunts]

181

[laughing]

182
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,796
I love your zappy kisses.

183
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,924
Callum, you figured it out?
You can do magic again!

184
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,009
- That's incredible, Prince Callum.
- Thanks.

185
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,720
Uh... who are you?

186
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,514
You missed a few things
while you were out.

187
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,392
This is Corvus. He's on our side now.

188
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,268
I've always been on the same side.

189
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,605
- I serve the young king.
- What?

190
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,024
I know about Dad.

191
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,449
I... I don't know what to say.

192
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,660
I'm so sorry that I didn't tell you.

193
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,955
I tried to, but I just... couldn't.

194
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:08,018
I'm sorry, little one,
but you are agile, young, and alive...

195
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,979
and I need you.

196
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,028
- [objects clattering]
- [man] Hey! What are you doing?

197
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,865
[woman] You can't be in here!
The patient needs rest.

198
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,620
Claudia? What... what are you doing?

199
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,040
[screaming]

200
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,795
[screaming continues]

201
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,929
[grunts] Hey, what's... what's this?

202
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,931
I can... I can move my toes.

203
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,350
I can move my toes!

204
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,479
I forgot how much
I love wiggling them. [laughing]

205
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,065
I can... I can feel again!

206
00:12:55,149 --> 00:13:00,237
I can feel my knees,
and my strong, powerful thighs. [laughs]

207
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,491
And my ribs! Ahh! Ugh!

208
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,202
[groaning] I broke ribs, didn't I?

209
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,038
[groaning] It's horrible!

210
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,540
I can feel again! Ahh!

211
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,833
[sighs]

212
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,335
Claudia.

213
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,589
Clauds, are you okay?

214
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,801
[breathing heavily] You're gonna
be better now.

215
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,012
That's all that matters.

216
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,021
[inhales and exhales]

217
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,361
Everything's packed
and everyone's healthy.

218
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,280
And we're just a few hours
from the border of Xadia.

219
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,573
Packed and ready!

220
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,660
- [Zym yips]
- [Bait grunts]

221
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,871
[whimpers]

222
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,165
- Let's do this.
- [Ezran] Callum.

223
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,586
When you told me
assassins were coming for Dad,

224
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,047
I ran away and hid in the walls.

225
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,508
With a healthy stash of jelly tarts,
as I recall.

226
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,093
Yeah.

227
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:08,222
And when I found out Dad was gone forever,
I ran away again.

228
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,183
I've been running away from things
my whole life.

229
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,061
But I can't run away from growing up.

230
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,229
Now that you're King Ezran,

231
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,482
are you gonna start saying
wise things like that all the time?

232
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:28,409
When you grow up, you have to face things
you're not ready for.

233
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,744
Wait, what?

234
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,414
I'm not going with you to Xadia.

235
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,792
I have to face my responsibility.

236
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,378
Now that I'm King, I have to go home.

237
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,839
Maybe I can help the world
better from the throne.

238
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,050
I can do whatever I can to stop the war.

239
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,971
Ezran, returning Zym to his mother
is the world's best hope.

240
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,765
I know! And you guys will do that.

241
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:55,895
You'll find his mom,
and Zym will take his place in Xadia,

242
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,938
just like I have to take mine.

243
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,814
Ezran...

244
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,402
I wish I could go with you, but I can't.

245
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,363
You and Rayla have to do this without me.

246
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,742
I'll travel with the king,
and keep him safe.

247
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,286
Ezran, are you sure?

248
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,081
I'll miss you, Rayla,
but I'll see you again.

249
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:17,832
I promise.

250
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,794
You'd better. I know where you live.

251
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:25,090
As soon as Zym is home,
I'll come back to help you.

252
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,385
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

253
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,305
[whimpering]

254
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,308
I'm so proud of you, little guy.

255
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,769
You're going to grow up
so strong and good.

256
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,104
I'm sorry I couldn't help you
learn to fly,

257
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,065
but I know you'll get it soon!

258
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,149
[whimpers]

259
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,957
I wish you could come with me, too,
but you need to go be with your mom.

260
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,833
That's your home.

261
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,044
Both of us need to go home.

262
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,172

[Aaravos] <i>You tried

and to Duren!

275
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,065
[Rayla] This canyon leads
to the Moonstone Path.

276
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,108
I can't believe we're almost to Xadia.

277
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:52,237
We came this far and... Ez isn't with us.

278
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,657
I know, but we can't think about that now.

279

He's doing the right thing, and so are we.

[Callum] One simply walks into Xadia, huh?

282
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,217
[Rayla] Hold on!

283
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,304
There's sort of a trick to it.

284
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,020
Not all the rocks sink that quickly.

285
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,107
A few will let us stand on them
long enough to walk across.

286
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,527
Those special stones
are called the Moonstone Path.

287
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,029
[Callum] Okay, great.

- So how do we know...
- Patience, friend.

289

The Moonstone Path! Oh, I get it.

[Aaravos] You're in danger.
They've come for you.

Do as I tell you. Prepare for battle.

[Aaravos] Stop!

[Opeli] You're completely
surrounded, Viren! Give yourself up.

Don't make me give the order.

00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,364
You're doing it, you're flying!
I knew you could do it!

323
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,117
He's trying to block the sun!

324
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,205
- [Zym yelps]
- [both gasp]

325
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,706
[whimpering]

326
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,003
He isn't going to make it!

327
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,757
<i>Aspiro!</i>

328
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,975
[both] Yeah! Whoo!

329
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,694
We can see the path again! Run!

330
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,911
- We did it! We made it across!
- [Rayla] Whoo! Yeah!

331
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,831
[yips]

332
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,711
- [Ezran] Whoo!
- [Corvus] If I may be so bold...

333
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,297
you're a weird king, King Ezran.

334
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,841
[Ezran laughing] I know.

335
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,893
[Soren] We both failed
our secret missions, Claudia.

336
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,146
What's Dad gonna say?

337
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:03,483
We're both alive,
that's the important thing.

338
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,069
And we're not coming back empty-handed.

339
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,489
It's the horn you cut off the dragon.

340
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,243
Failed missions, mad Dad.

341
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,496
But dragon horn means magic.

342
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,748
Maybe Dad not mad!

343
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,669
- Yes! That was amazing!
- [Soren] Ahh!

344
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,051
[Rayla] This is it, Callum.

345
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,179
Xadia.

346
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,641
- [gasps]
- Oh, no.

347
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,060
It's him.

348
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,229
Sol Regem.

349
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,940
[growls menacingly]
