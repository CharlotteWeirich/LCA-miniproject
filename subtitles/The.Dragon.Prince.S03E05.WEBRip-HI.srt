Because we have laws.

Our laws tell us there is a way

No matter what.

So, when the Moonshadow elves came,
I did everything I could to protect him.

But it wasn't enough.

Of course.

I can count on you, Claudia.

164
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:14,400
Everything's going to be okay, Dad.
I'm here for you.

165
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:30,708
Well played. She will be a valuable asset.

166
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:35,004
She is not an asset. She is my daughter.

167
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,475
Come on out, everybody.

168
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,362
Wow! I can't believe
you all worked together to save me.

169
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,908
Credit where credit is due.
Soren was the mastermind.

170
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,076
"Mastermind." I like it.

171
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,121
That can be my new nickname.
It even rhymes.

172
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,082
"Sor-ine the Mastermind."

173
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,418
That does not rhyme.

174
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,131
I have to go,
or my dad will know something is up.

175
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,634
These guys will take you
to the rendezvous point.

176
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,720
Thanks, Soren. You're the best crown guard
a king could ask for.

[Ambler growls]

[Callum] She got
the Ambler's foot unstuck.

184
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,678
What do we do now?

185
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,596
We're going to have to do this
the hard way.

[Ambler growling]

No. No, no, no. You're not gonna...

189
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,905
This is crazy. This is totally crazy.

[Ambler growling]

Ah!

194
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,221
Whatever your stupid scheme was,
it's over, Nyx.

[panting]

196
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,309
We, uh... We trusted you.

00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,144
- What's the big deal?
- [Zym chitters]

198
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,229
I was just taking Zym back to his mum.

199
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,856
He would get home faster,

200
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:02,192
and I assume I'd get some sweet treasure
or something as a reward.

201
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,111
So, you know, win-win.

202
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:07,948
- Hand. Zym. Over.
- [panting]

203
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,867
- [laughing] Wow.
- [Zym growling softly]

204
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,244
You really think
you have me cornered, don't you?

205
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,538
You've forgotten something.

206
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,457
Oh, yeah? What's that?

207
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,051
- She's right. We did forget.
- Ugh.

208
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,605
Soren should be here. Why is he late?

209
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,942
Oh, Soren told me
he needed some bathroom time.

210
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,695
He said he ate some bad cheese,
and now he's "paying the price."

211
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,780
[sighs]

212
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,616
You do know what he means
by "paying the price"?

213
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,535
- He means that he's...
- Yes, yes, I get it.

214
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,204
No need to paint a picture.

215
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,581
I would only need
one color for that picture.

216
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,418
Brown.

217
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,304
[indistinct chatter]

218
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:23,065
I am humbled to stand before you.

219
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:29,154
You are the greatest fighting force
in the history of humankind!

[all cheering]

221
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,159
Xadia hates us.

222
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,828
They hate humanity.

223
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,872
And they would destroy us if we let them.

224
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,543
But we will fight back!

225
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,545
[all cheering]

226
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,968
But before we embark
on our journey across the world,

227
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,887
a journey that will change history,

228
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,057
there is one unpleasant matter.

229
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,892
- [all groaning]
- What?

230
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:05,024
You see, Ezran, in his last act as king,

231
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,485
insisted that all those
who no longer wish to fight

232
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,156
be allowed to lay down their arms.

[all exclaiming]

Well, go on, leave us, cowards.
We don't want you anyway.

No, no, let them be!

00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,183
Let them return safely to their families.

239
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:26,146
But even their families will know
that they are deserters.

240
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,316
They will wear a badge on their clothing.

241
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:33,946
A badge of shame and cowardice,
a broken link!

242
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,953
A chain is only as strong
as its weakest link.

243
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,581
It is better to be rid
of our weak links today!

How can we follow them when she's flying?

Wow! How'd you learn to do that?

I've never done that before in my life!

Why did it have to be soulfangs?

You're going back to Xadia
and finding your brother.

[cawing in the distance]

I was surprised to receive
a message from Katolis.

It's not signed, but I assume
it's from the strapping young idiot.

Ugh. But I am happy to help.

Goodbye, Opeli.
Thank you for believing in me.

I serve the true king.

Corvus, I'm sorry I let you down as king.

It only took me a few days
to mess everything up.

276
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,060
Are you kidding?
In your first few days as king,

277
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,604
you showed more courage,
strength and grace

278
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,606
than most leaders show in a lifetime.

279

Oh. [grunts]

Goodbye, Ezran.

Ho, ho, ho. Goodbye, Bait.

So, how are you going to get home?

Oh, I thought I might spend a few days
travelling in disguise,

messing with some humans.

[Rayla] Callum! Why aren't you running?

Right. Sorry. Sorry.

303
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,381
[Nyx] So, why did you save me?

304
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,259
Even after I tricked you and betrayed you?

305
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,762
It's because I'm charming, right?

306
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,223
Despite it all,
you can't help but like me?

307

Nope, that's not it.
I do not like you at all.

Oh. Then, why?

309
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,734
- It's because Rayla is a hero.
- What?

310
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,529
Rayla saves people. She's brave.

311
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:29,533
She does what's right,
even if it puts her own life in danger,

and even when the odds seem impossible.

Even when it means her own people
might misunderstand and turn against her.

00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,876
Rayla is selfless, strong and caring.

315
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:42,254
That's what makes her a hero.

316
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,757
That's what makes her Rayla.

317

You are so...

318
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,730
Oh, no. I'm so... I'm sorry.
I just got carried away.

Next thing I knew, my lips
were getting way ahead of me, and...

Shut up.
