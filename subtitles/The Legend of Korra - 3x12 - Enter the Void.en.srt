1
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:08,547
Earth.

2
00:00:08,548 --> 00:00:09,798
Fire.

3
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:11,589
Air.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,965
Water.

5
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:17,547
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements

6
00:00:17,548 --> 00:00:20,266
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:20,298 --> 00:00:25,936

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,507
The new air nation is in jeopardy.

9
00:00:27,508 --> 00:00:30,048
In an effort to force
Korra to surrender herself,

10
00:00:30,049 --> 00:00:31,609
Zaheer ambushed the northern air temple.

11
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:35,382
Tenzin, Bumi and Kya attempted
to hold off the Red Lotus

12
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:36,589
but were injured in battle.

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,173
The airbenders were unable to escape

14
00:00:39,174 --> 00:00:40,923
and everyone was taken captive,

15
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:41,799
except Kai.

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,798
Now Korra and team
Avatar race to the temple,

17
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,880
hoping to mount a rescue.

18
00:00:46,237 --> 00:00:49,965
__

19
00:00:55,893 --> 00:00:57,602
I say we make our approach from the west.

20
00:00:57,603 --> 00:00:59,602
Drop down from the airship on cables.

21
00:00:59,603 --> 00:01:03,435
Ambush these Red Lotus lowlifes
before they know what hit them.

22
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:04,560
It'll never work.

23
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:07,351
That combustion lady will
pick us off one by one.

24
00:01:07,352 --> 00:01:10,892
You have a better idea
how to save the airbenders?

25
00:01:10,893 --> 00:01:11,519
Yeah.

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,643
We come up from the valley,

27
00:01:12,644 --> 00:01:14,844
scale the side of the mountain,
and take them off guard.

28
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:15,892
That could work.

29
00:01:15,893 --> 00:01:18,351
And give them the high ground? No.

30
00:01:18,352 --> 00:01:19,518
If their lavabender spots us,

31
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,199
he'll melt the mountainside and us with it.

32
00:01:21,223 --> 00:01:22,268
Wait! I got it.

33
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:23,852
I'll disguise myself as a lost hiker.

34
00:01:23,853 --> 00:01:26,602
And once I'm in the temple,
I'll distract the Red Lotus

35
00:01:26,603 --> 00:01:27,892
with my bird calls.

36
00:01:29,935 --> 00:01:31,101
Caw! Caw!

37
00:01:32,686 --> 00:01:33,892
Caw! Caw!

38
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:36,602
That's when you all strike!

39
00:01:36,603 --> 00:01:37,892
Bird calls?

40
00:01:37,893 --> 00:01:39,310
Really?

41
00:01:39,311 --> 00:01:42,892
Well, I haven't noticed you
offering any suggestions.

42
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:44,184
It doesn't matter.

43
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:45,435
None of these ideas will work.

44
00:01:45,436 --> 00:01:48,184
The second Zaheer realizes
we're up to something,

45
00:01:48,185 --> 00:01:49,685
he'll wipe out the airbenders.

46
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:52,059
And Opal is one of those airbenders.

47
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,852
Believe me, I understand what's at stake.

48
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:55,976
Then I think you'll agree.

49
00:01:55,977 --> 00:02:00,018
The only plan that will work
is for me to give myself up.

50
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,310
What? Korra, no.

51
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:02,934
We'll figure out another way.

52
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:04,643
I talked it over with Lord Zuko,

53
00:02:04,644 --> 00:02:06,892
and I've given it a lot of thought.

54
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,018
I have to do this.

55
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:11,310
You can't expect us to sit by
and just let Zaheer take you.

56
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:13,892
The world has been out of
balance for far too long.

57
00:02:13,893 --> 00:02:15,518
It needs the air nation back again.

58
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,059
I can't let Zaheer destroy
it and everyone we love.

59
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,893
Help me save the airbenders.

60
00:02:21,894 --> 00:02:26,560
Then you can can worry about saving me.

61
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:27,852
We're with you, Korra.

62
00:02:27,853 --> 00:02:29,727
Yes, whatever you need.

63
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:30,934
We're here.

64
00:02:30,935 --> 00:02:35,269
I'll go radio Zaheer.

65
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,143
Zaheer, are you there?

66
00:02:48,144 --> 00:02:49,893
It's me.

67
00:02:49,894 --> 00:02:51,727
I've been waiting for your call.

68
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:54,518
So do we have a deal? Yes.

69
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:57,435
You release the airbenders,
and then I'll turn myself over.

70
00:02:57,436 --> 00:03:00,351
And take away the only leverage I have?

71
00:03:00,352 --> 00:03:01,476
No.

72
00:03:01,477 --> 00:03:02,477
I can't do that.

73
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:03,810
Listen carefully.

74
00:03:03,811 --> 00:03:07,934
Here's what I want you to do.

75
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:10,018
Will you sit down?

76
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,143
I'm already tense enough as it is!

77
00:03:12,144 --> 00:03:13,852
I'm just worried about Opal.

78
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:16,351
And Pabu's not here to comfort me.

79
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,018
I hope he and Naga are
doing okay back in Zaofu.

80
00:03:27,352 --> 00:03:28,602
No.

81
00:03:28,603 --> 00:03:29,852
Not Mako's scarf!

82
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:32,351
Bad dog and ratthingy!

83
00:03:32,352 --> 00:03:34,892
I'm very disappointed in you two.

84
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:49,018
- Did you speak to Zaheer? 
- Yes.

85
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,143
He told me to come to the top
of Laghima's peak at noon. Alone.

86
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:57,643
Once he has me, he'll release
the airbenders over to you

87
00:03:57,644 --> 00:03:58,561
at the temple.

88
00:03:58,562 --> 00:04:00,122
I think I figured out a way to play this

89
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:04,184
so the airbenders and Korra
all come out in one piece.

90
00:04:04,185 --> 00:04:05,102
How?

91
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:07,018
Zaheer doesn't know how
many of us there are.

92
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,351
So we have the numbers advantage.

93
00:04:09,352 --> 00:04:10,602
I say we split into two teams.

94
00:04:10,603 --> 00:04:13,892
Mako, Bolin and Asami will take
the airship up to the temple.

95
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:17,184
Meanwhile, my metalbenders,
Tonraq, Lin, and I will get

96
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:22,603
into position below Laghima's peak.

97
00:04:23,893 --> 00:04:25,934
Let go your earthly tether.

98
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:27,685
Enter the void.

99
00:04:27,686 --> 00:04:30,560
Empty and become wind.

100
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:36,059
Empty and become wind.

101
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,892
The airbenders are secure.

102
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:40,810
Thank you, P'Li.

103
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:42,059
For everything.

104
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,602
Of course.

105
00:04:43,603 --> 00:04:45,476
I want you to know,

106
00:04:45,477 --> 00:04:46,892
not one day went by in that prison

107
00:04:46,893 --> 00:04:50,059
when I didn't think of you.

108
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,892
The years apart only made
my love for you stronger.

109
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:56,685
And, deep down, I knew you'd
find a way to get me out.

110
00:04:56,686 --> 00:04:58,560
Just like you saved me from becoming

111
00:04:58,561 --> 00:05:01,560
that warlord's killing
machine when I was a girl.

112
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:05,602
You've shown me what true freedom means.

113
00:05:05,603 --> 00:05:06,685
And, after today,

114
00:05:06,686 --> 00:05:10,976
we'll show the entire world what it means.

115
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,393
No more prisons.

116
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:14,018
No more running.

117
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:15,768
I love you, Zaheer.

118
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:19,893
I love you too.

119
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:37,435
Radio the second you see those airbenders.

120
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:38,810
I will, chief.

121
00:05:38,811 --> 00:05:41,852
Good luck.

122
00:05:45,977 --> 00:05:47,893
Be careful, Korra.

123
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:52,144
You too.

124
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,727
- Korra.
- Don't worry, dad.

125
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:14,892
I'll be all right.

126
00:06:14,893 --> 00:06:17,768
I just want you to know
how proud I am of you.

127
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:20,143
The risk you're taking
to save the air nation

128
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:22,602
will be remembered for generations.

129
00:06:22,603 --> 00:06:23,892
I love you, dad.

130
00:06:23,893 --> 00:06:28,352
I love you too, sweetheart.

131
00:06:30,644 --> 00:06:32,685
And, dad.

132
00:06:32,686 --> 00:06:33,727
Watch out for Zaheer.

133
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:36,351
He's not very fond of world leaders.

134
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:37,393
I can handle him.

135
00:06:37,394 --> 00:06:39,922
Just stay focused on your mission.

136
00:07:05,477 --> 00:07:06,768
Oh, man.

137
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:09,727
Must have been some
fight.

138
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:11,435
Mako, do you see the airbenders?

139
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:12,227
Not yet.

140
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:13,435
We're just arriving.

141
00:07:13,436 --> 00:07:18,269
Don't turn yourself over
until I get a visual on them.

142
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:34,810
This way.

143
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:39,810
You want the airbenders or not?

144
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:53,311
Drop your staff and surrender yourself.

145
00:07:55,603 --> 00:08:00,227
Don't make me come get you.

146
00:08:06,893 --> 00:08:08,768
Mako.

147
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:09,892
What's going on?

148
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:11,560
They're here.

149
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:13,934
But so is the lavabender.

150
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:16,518
Tell ghazan to let the airbenders go.

151
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,643
Not until you turn yourself over.

152
00:08:18,644 --> 00:08:22,893
This isn't a negotiation.

153
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:27,393
Wipe them out.

154
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:28,810
No! Wait!

155
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:34,059
I'm coming.

156
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,539
Stand down.

157
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:53,518
And don't bother trying
to metalbend out of these.

158
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,892
They're platinum.

159
00:09:02,144 --> 00:09:06,311
We have her.

160
00:09:12,477 --> 00:09:13,768
It's okay, Tenzin.

161
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:17,976
We're about to get you out of here.

162
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:31,393
Korra, it was a trick!

163
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:32,311
They're not here!

164
00:09:32,312 --> 00:09:33,893
Don't turn yourself over!

165
00:09:33,894 --> 00:09:38,059
We had a deal!

166
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:41,101
Chief, get Korra out of there now!

167
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:45,185
Go! Go!

168
00:10:11,682 --> 00:10:13,140
Get the Avatar on the airship.

169
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:14,291
I'll deal with them.

170
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:11,141
Nowhere to go, Zaheer!

171
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,348
Where are the airbenders?

172
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,556
I don't know.

173
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:28,765
Zaheer moved them out of the temple.

174
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:33,557
Will you just bury them already?

175
00:11:48,016 --> 00:11:52,015
Come on.

176
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:53,556
We have to get back to the airship!

177
00:11:53,557 --> 00:11:57,891
Not gonna happen! The exit's blocked!

178
00:12:09,474 --> 00:12:12,222
- Where's Oogi?
- Gone.

179
00:12:12,223 --> 00:12:15,348
All the bison got scared
off during the attack.

180
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:17,973
But I think I know another way out.

181
00:12:17,974 --> 00:12:21,466
Bolin, can you get us through that wall?

182
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:22,286
On it!

183
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:51,974
Through there.

184
00:13:03,223 --> 00:13:04,141
Is it just me?

185
00:13:04,142 --> 00:13:07,098
Or is it, uh, getting really warm in here?

186
00:13:07,099 --> 00:13:12,182
Oh, this is not good.

187
00:13:12,183 --> 00:13:16,223
Let's move it, people!

188
00:14:03,307 --> 00:14:06,932
Say hello to the earth queen for me.

189
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,849
Dad!

190
00:14:19,016 --> 00:14:20,598
We're pinned down!

191
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:22,222
I'm gonna draw her fire.

192
00:14:22,223 --> 00:14:23,348
You take her out.

193
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:27,390
Lin, no.

194
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:34,348
I love you.

195
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:36,405
Come and get me, you thirdeyed freak!

196
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:53,306
Ooh!

197
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:09,223
P'Li!

198
00:15:37,307 --> 00:15:38,806
It's over, Zaheer.

199
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:41,556
Let go your earthly tether.

200
00:15:41,557 --> 00:15:43,222
Release the Avatar!

201
00:15:43,223 --> 00:15:44,223
Enter the void.

202
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:45,973
This is your last warning!

203
00:15:45,974 --> 00:15:50,016
Empty and become wind.

204
00:15:52,432 --> 00:15:56,099
No! Stop!

205
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:08,848
Did he just fly?

206
00:16:08,849 --> 00:16:12,057
Guess he doesn't need a ride.

207
00:16:18,682 --> 00:16:21,682
Korra.

208
00:16:32,387 --> 00:16:34,594
We can't outrun it!

209
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:39,804
This way!

210
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:50,345
Now what?

211
00:16:58,011 --> 00:16:59,344
Bolin!

212
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:07,010
Yah!

213
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:08,011
Incredible.

214
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:10,011
You're a lavabender.

215
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:12,052
I know.

216
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:13,845
I just found out.

217
00:17:15,011 --> 00:17:17,261
Hey, you guys need a lift?

218
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:18,137
Kai.

219
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:19,386
You're all right.

220
00:17:19,387 --> 00:17:20,594
More or less.

221
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:24,971
Everyone hop on.

222
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:48,052
I owe you my life.

223
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:49,469
Thank you, Captain.

224
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:55,469
You can call me Kuvira.

225
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,636
Caw! Caw!

226
00:17:57,637 --> 00:17:59,594
Caw! Caw!

227
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:01,928
Caw! Caw!

228
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:02,595
Caw! Caw!

229
00:18:06,095 --> 00:18:07,012
Hey, everybody.

230
00:18:07,013 --> 00:18:08,594
There's something I gotta tell you.

231
00:18:08,595 --> 00:18:11,386
How did you guys make it
out of that temple alive?

232
00:18:11,387 --> 00:18:12,761
It was all Bolin.

233
00:18:12,762 --> 00:18:13,970
I thought we were done for.

234
00:18:13,971 --> 00:18:16,010
Then out of nowhere, he lavabends.

235
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,636
I knew you had the
potential for something big.

236
00:18:18,637 --> 00:18:20,928
You just had to believe in yourself.

237
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:21,929
You're right.

238
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,170
Being moments from death was
a pretty good motivator too.

239
00:18:24,194 --> 00:18:27,010
Of course, we never would
have made it back without Kai.

240
00:18:27,011 --> 00:18:29,010
Glad I could help. So anyway

241
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:31,052
did Zaheer get away with Korra?

242
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:32,011
I'm afraid so.

243
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:35,386
- Apparently, he can fly now.
- What?

244
00:18:35,387 --> 00:18:36,678
- How?
- Are you sure?

245
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:39,553
I wouldn't believe it either
if I hadn't seen it for myself.

246
00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:44,052
I've heard the legends about
Guru Laghima's ability to fly.

247
00:18:44,053 --> 00:18:46,553
But I never imagined they were true.

248
00:18:46,554 --> 00:18:48,094
So what's our next move?

249
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:49,095
I have an idea.

250
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:50,219
Not right now, kid!

251
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,469
We need to figure out
where Zaheer took Korra.

252
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,010
And find the airbenders.

253
00:18:54,011 --> 00:18:56,511
That's what I've been trying to tell you!

254
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:57,792
I know where the airbenders are,

255
00:18:57,816 --> 00:18:59,469
and I bet it's where Korra is too!

256
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,136
Well, why didn't you say something?

257
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:05,970
Where are they? How did you find them?

258
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:07,553
After I got blasted out of the sky,

259
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:09,034
I woke up on the side of the Mountain,

260
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:10,761
where this little fellow found me.

261
00:19:11,513 --> 00:19:12,845
I tried to sneak back into the temple

262
00:19:12,846 --> 00:19:14,166
to see if I could rescue everyone,

263
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:15,807
and that's when I saw the airship leaving.

264
00:19:15,831 --> 00:19:18,302
I followed it to some
caves a few miles from here.

265
00:19:18,303 --> 00:19:20,594
That giant lady met up with some people

266
00:19:20,595 --> 00:19:22,803
who took the airbenders into the caves.

267
00:19:22,804 --> 00:19:24,219
Was it Ghazan and Minghua?

268
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,386
No, there were four more of them.

269
00:19:26,387 --> 00:19:27,511
Didn't look familiar.

270
00:19:27,512 --> 00:19:29,469
Must be more Red Lotus
members than we thought.

271
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,011
I couldn't fight them all on my own.

272
00:19:31,012 --> 00:19:34,010
So I came back here, hoping
you guys would show up.

273
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:35,211
We need to get to those caves.

274
00:19:35,235 --> 00:19:38,553
How? I don't think we
can all fit on my bison.

275
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:46,803
Oogi!

276
00:19:51,011 --> 00:19:53,541
I'm glad to see you too, old friend.

277
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:01,136
I wanna come with you.

278
00:20:01,137 --> 00:20:02,010
No, Kuvira.

279
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:03,011
Stay with the injured.

280
00:20:03,012 --> 00:20:08,928
We'll be back for you
once we have the Avatar.

281
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:17,553
Hey, um, I appreciate
you coming back for us.

282
00:20:17,554 --> 00:20:20,010
Sorry for ever giving you a hard time.

283
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,428
That's okay.

284
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:22,636
I probably deserved it.

285
00:20:22,637 --> 00:20:24,803
Yeah, you kinda did.

286
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,302
Why didn't you ever tell us you can fly?

287
00:20:43,303 --> 00:20:44,428
I wasn't sure I could.

288
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:49,177
Only one other airbender
in history had the ability.

289
00:20:49,178 --> 00:20:51,761
How'd you figure out how to do it?

290
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:52,803
I found true freedom.

291
00:20:52,804 --> 00:20:57,010
I am no longer bound to this
earth by worldly desires.

292
00:20:57,011 --> 00:21:00,970
I have entered the void.

293
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:03,052
Where's P'Li?

294
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,010
She sacrificed her life for our cause.

295
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:11,804
Now let's make sure it wasn't in vain.

296
00:21:29,011 --> 00:21:30,886
You...

297
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:32,636
You killed my father.

298
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:37,261
I understand your grief.

299
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:41,010
I also lost someone I loved today.

300
00:21:41,011 --> 00:21:43,386
But your pain will soon be over.

301
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:48,010
Bring the poison.

302
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:06,888
