1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Water,

2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,447
Earth,

3
00:00:04,448 --> 00:00:06,197
Fire,

4
00:00:06,198 --> 00:00:08,602
Air

5
00:00:08,603 --> 00:00:13,133
Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.

6
00:00:13,134 --> 00:00:17,259
Then, everything changed
when the fire nation attacked.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,202
Only the avatar, master of all
four elements, could stop them.

8
00:00:22,203 --> 00:00:24,862
But when the world
needed him most, he vanished.

9
00:00:24,863 --> 00:00:29,319
100 years passed, and my brother and i
discovered the new avatar,

10
00:00:29,354 --> 00:00:30,876
an airbender named aang

11
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:33,531
And although his
airbending skills are great

12
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:36,259
He has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,278
But i believe aang
can save the world.

15
00:00:45,623 --> 00:00:48,478
Man: previously on "avatar. "

16
00:00:48,479 --> 00:01:25,816
["Previously on Avatar" sequence includes clips from Jet, City of Walls and Secrets, Appa's Lost Days. ]

17
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:47,310
We found a printer to make our posters.

18
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,571
Hey, I thought designing "the
lost Appa poster" was my job.

19
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:54,458
I've been working all day on my Appa.

20
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:57,666
Sokka, the arrow is on Appa's head.

21
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:59,855
This IS his head.

22
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:02,787
Why are feet coming out of it?

23
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:06,581
Those are his horns!
I haven't seen him awhile ok?

24
00:02:06,582 --> 00:02:08,918
It looks just like him to me.

25
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:13,311
Thank you, I worked really...
why do feel the need to do that?

26
00:02:13,312 --> 00:02:15,814
Let's just stick with
the professional version.

27
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:20,066
Grrrr!
Come on, let's get busy!

28
00:02:37,226 --> 00:02:40,476
So you're the genius
behind this incredible brew.

29
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:42,789
The whole city is buzzing about you.

30
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,946
I hope Pao pays you well.

31
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:47,537
Good tea is its own reward.

32
00:02:47,538 --> 00:02:50,653
But it doesn't have to be the only reward.

33
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:53,301
How would you like to
have your own tea shop?

34
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:57,096
My own tea shop? This is a dream come true.

35
00:02:57,097 --> 00:03:01,490
What's going on here?
Are you trying to poach my tea maker?

36
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:04,803
Sorry Pao, that's business for you,
am I right?

37
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:09,779
Mushie, if you stay,
I will make you Assistant Manager.

38
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,184
Wait, Senior Assistant manager.

39
00:03:12,185 --> 00:03:15,125
I'll provide you with a new
apartment in the upper ring.

40
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,854
The Tea shop is yours
to do whatever you want.

41
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:19,537
Complete creative freedom.

42
00:03:19,538 --> 00:03:22,795
I even get to name the shop?
Of course!

43
00:03:22,796 --> 00:03:26,709
Uh, Senior Executive Assistant Manager?

44
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:32,421
Did you hear nephew?

45
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:33,830
This man wants to give us

46
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:37,516
our own tea shop
in the upper ring of the city.

47
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,233
That's right young man.

48
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:42,622
You're life is about
to change for the better.

49
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,601
I'll try to contain my joy.

50
00:04:15,286 --> 00:04:18,215
I just finished dropping all the leaflets.

51
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,314
Has anyone come in with news about Appa?

52
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:22,586
It's only been a day, just be patient.

53
00:04:25,081 --> 00:04:28,593
Wow, you're right!
Patience really pays off.

54
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:32,066
Joo Dee?

55
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:36,333
Hello, Aang and Katara and Sokka and Toph.

56
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:39,222
What happened to you?
Did the Dai Li throw you in jail?

57
00:04:39,223 --> 00:04:42,650
What, jail? Of course not.

58
00:04:42,651 --> 00:04:46,603
The Dai Li are the protectors
of our cultural heritage.

59
00:04:46,604 --> 00:04:49,227
But you disappeared
at the Earth King's party.

60
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:52,843
Oh, I simply took a short
vacation to Lake Laogai,

61
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:55,719
out in the country.
It was quite relaxing.

62
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,007
But then they replaced you
with some other woman

63
00:04:58,008 --> 00:04:59,690
who also said her name was Joo Dee.

64
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:03,210
I'm Joo Dee.
Why are you here?

65
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:05,765
Dropping flyers and putting up posters

66
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,599
isn't permitted within the city.

67
00:05:07,634 --> 00:05:09,398
Not without proper clearance.

68
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,956
We can't wait around to
get permission for everything.

69
00:05:11,957 --> 00:05:15,122
You are absolutely forbidden
by the rules of the city

70
00:05:15,123 --> 00:05:17,437
to continue putting up posters.

71
00:05:17,438 --> 00:05:21,541
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE RULES,
AND WE'RE NOT ASKING PERMISSON!

72
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:25,256
We're finding Appa on our own and
you should just stay out of our way!

73
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:28,721
That might come back
to bite us in the blubber.

74
00:05:28,722 --> 00:05:29,471
I don't care.

75
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:32,076
From now on we do whatever it
takes to find Appa.

76
00:05:32,077 --> 00:05:34,660
YEAH!
Let's break some rules!

77
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:50,977
I am very disappointed in your work
with the Avatar and his friends, Joo Dee.

78
00:05:50,978 --> 00:05:54,268
I had hoped that you would
be able to control this situation.

79
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:57,437
I'm so sorry,
but they don't trust me anymore.

80
00:05:57,438 --> 00:06:00,695
I don't think I can keep working like this.

81
00:06:00,696 --> 00:06:05,122
Joo Dee, the Earth King
has invited you to Lake Laogai.

82
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:11,262
I am honored to accept his invitation.

83
00:06:12,658 --> 00:06:16,138
Good. Now go await further orders.

84
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:22,471
If the Avatar keeps searching for his bison,

85
00:06:22,471 --> 00:06:26,236
it could upset the delicate balance we worked so hard to achieve in this city.

86
00:06:26,237 --> 00:06:28,973
It could even cost us control of the Earth King.

87
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:30,724
Should we take care of him?

88
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:34,366
No. It's much too dangerous to confront him directly.

89
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:38,469
Let's see if we can still handle this...
quietly.

90
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,949
So, I was thinking about names for my new tea shop.

91
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,208
How about the Jasmine Dragon?

92
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:55,257
It's dramatic, poetic, has a nice ring to it.

93
00:06:55,258 --> 00:06:59,339
The Avatar's here in Ba Sing Se.
And he's lost his bison.

94
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,693
We have a chance for a new life here.

95
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:05,829
If you start stirring up trouble,

96
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,654
we could lose all the good things that are happening for us.

97
00:07:09,654 --> 00:07:11,827
Good things that are happening for you.

98
00:07:11,828 --> 00:07:14,063
Have you ever thought that I want more from life

99
00:07:14,064 --> 00:07:16,350
than a nice apartment and a job serving tea?

100
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:20,210
There is nothing wrong with a life of peace and prosperity.

101
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:26,271
I suggest you think about what it is that you want for your life, and why.

102
00:07:26,272 --> 00:07:28,261
I want my destiny.

103
00:07:28,262 --> 00:07:30,914
What that means is up to you.

104
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:36,384
The Tea Weevil!
No, that's stupid.

105
00:07:39,646 --> 00:07:41,727
Well split up to cover more area.

106
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:44,219
Toph, I guess you should just come with me.

107
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,598
Why because you think I can't put up posters on my own?

108
00:07:50,683 --> 00:07:55,744
It's upside-down isn't it?
I'll just go with Sokka.

109
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:05,732
Katara?

110
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:09,957
I think I can help you.

111
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,879
Katara! I've changed!

112
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:23,668
Tell it to some other girl, Jet!

113
00:08:28,606 --> 00:08:31,458
I don't want to fight you!
I'm here to help.

114
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:45,704
Katara, what is it?

115
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:48,241
Jet's back.

116
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:55,020
We can't trust anything Jet says.

117
00:08:55,021 --> 00:08:57,056
But we don't' even know why he's here.

118
00:08:57,057 --> 00:09:00,360
I don't care why he's here.
Whatever the reason is, it can't be good.

119
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:02,543
I'm here to help you find Appa.

120
00:09:05,182 --> 00:09:08,334
Katara, we have to give him a chance.

121
00:09:08,335 --> 00:09:09,715
I swear, I've changed.

122
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:13,131
I was a troubled person,
and I let my anger get out of control.

123
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:16,551
But I don't even have the gang now.
I've put all that behind me.

124
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:17,779
You're lying!

125
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:22,368
He's not lying.

126
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:23,299
How can you tell?

127
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,556
I can feel his breathing and heart beat.

128
00:09:25,557 --> 00:09:28,368
When people lie,
there is a physical reaction.

129
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:30,239
He's telling the truth.

130
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,945
Katara, we don't have any leads.

131
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:35,808
If Jet says he can take us to Appa,
we have to check it out.

132
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,086
Alright...
but we're not letting you out of out sight!

133
00:09:42,196 --> 00:09:44,214
This is the place I heard about.

134
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:47,653
There's nothing here.

135
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,616
If this is a trap!?

136
00:09:49,617 --> 00:09:51,721
I told you, I work nearby!

137
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:54,597
Two guys were talking about some giant furry creature they had.

138
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:56,112
I figured it must be Appa.

139
00:09:56,113 --> 00:09:56,999
He was here!

140
00:10:01,887 --> 00:10:03,857
We missed him.

141
00:10:03,858 --> 00:10:06,643
They took that big thing yesterday.

142
00:10:06,644 --> 00:10:08,900
Shipped him out to some island.

143
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:15,382
About time, I've been cleaning up fur
and various, uh leavings all day.

144
00:10:15,383 --> 00:10:17,635
What island!?
Where's Appa?!

145
00:10:17,636 --> 00:10:23,705
Foreman said some rich royal type on Whaletail Island bought him up,

146
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:28,241
guess for a zoo or such, though could be the meat would be good.

147
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:30,459
We've gotta get to Whaletail Island.

148
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,113
Where's whale tail island?

149
00:10:33,114 --> 00:10:36,248
Far. Very far.

150
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:40,547
Here it is. It's near the South Pole almost all the way back home.

151
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:43,814
Aang, It'll take us weeks just to get to the tip of the earth kingdom.

152
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:46,068
And then we'll need to find a boat to get to the island.

153
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,890
I don't care.

154
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:49,961
We have a chance to find Appa.
We have to try.

155
00:10:49,962 --> 00:10:56,295
Must be nice to visit an island.
I haven't had a vacation for years.

156
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:58,385
Don't you have some more hair to clean up?

157
00:10:58,386 --> 00:11:03,248
Shuffle on, I get ya.
No more need for "old sweepy".

158
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:04,453
You're right Aang.

159
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:07,205
Right now, our first concern has to be finding Appa.

160
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:08,873
We can come back when we have him.

161
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:10,283
All right, let's get moving.

162
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:11,626
I'll come with you.

163
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:13,197
We don't need your help.

164
00:11:13,198 --> 00:11:14,690
Why won't you trust me?

165
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,179
Gee, I wonder?

166
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,321
Was this guy your boyfriend or something?

167
00:11:21,322 --> 00:11:22,840
What? No!

168
00:11:22,841 --> 00:11:25,370
I can tell you're lyyyyying.

169
00:11:28,128 --> 00:11:31,121
We can take the train out to the wall,
but then we'll have to walk.

170
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:33,616
Don't worry, on the way back, we'll be flying!

171
00:11:33,617 --> 00:11:38,951
We're finally leaving Ba Sing Se.
Worst city ever!

172
00:11:38,952 --> 00:11:41,513
Jet!

173
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:45,056
I thought you said you didn't have your gang anymore?

174
00:11:45,057 --> 00:11:45,835
I don't.

175
00:11:45,836 --> 00:11:48,934
We were so worried.
How did you get away from the Dai Li?

176
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:50,214
The Dai Li?!

177
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:52,041
I don't know what she's talking about?

178
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:54,822
He got arrested by the Dai Li a couple weeks ago.

179
00:11:54,823 --> 00:11:56,305
We saw them drag him away.

180
00:11:56,306 --> 00:12:00,110
Why would I be arrested?
I've been living peacefully in the city.

181
00:12:00,111 --> 00:12:04,056
This doesn't make any sense.
They're both telling the truth.

182
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,738
That's impossible.

183
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:06,864
No, it's not.

184
00:12:06,865 --> 00:12:10,787
Toph can't tell who's lying because they both think they're telling the truth.

185
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:12,562
Jet's been brainwashed.

186
00:12:12,563 --> 00:12:17,615
That's crazy! It can't be.
Stay away from me.

187
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:35,763
Out of my way, skinny.

188
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,432
Huh?

189
00:12:57,433 --> 00:13:01,405
If you don't want to end up like him.
You'll do what I say.

190
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:06,309
The Dai Li must have sent Jet to mislead us,

191
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,326
and that janitor was part of their plot too.

192
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:10,428
I bet they have Appa here in the city.

193
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:12,680
Maybe he's in the same place they took Jet.

194
00:13:12,681 --> 00:13:14,146
Where did they take you?

195
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:17,055
Nowhere.
I, I don't know what you're talking about.

196
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:19,880
We need to find a way to jog his real memories.

197
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:23,635
Maybe Katara could kiss him.
That should bring something back.

198
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,647
Maybe you should kiss him, Sokka.

199
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:27,492
Hey, just an idea.

200
00:13:27,493 --> 00:13:28,464
A bad one.

201
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:31,949
Oo, wait. I got it.

202
00:13:36,423 --> 00:13:38,761
I don't think its working. Puh!

203
00:13:38,762 --> 00:13:42,466
Try to think of something from your past that triggers your emotions.

204
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:46,215
The Fire Nation,
remember what they did to your family.

205
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:48,652
Close your eyes.
Picture it.

206
00:14:00,887 --> 00:14:04,110
No! It's too painful.

207
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:06,359
Maybe this will help.

208
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:33,216
They took me to a headquarters under the water, like a lake.

209
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:35,840
Wait! Remember what Joo Dee said?

210
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,442
She said she went on vacation to Lake Laogai.

211
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:41,044
That's it! Lake Laogai.

212
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,942
So where's this secret headquarters?

213
00:14:50,943 --> 00:14:52,243
Under the water I think.

214
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:54,684
There's a tunnel right there near the shore.

215
00:15:20,155 --> 00:15:22,112
It's all starting to come back to me.

216
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:29,219
I'm Joo Dee. Welcome to Ba Sing Se.

217
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,519
We are so lucky to have our walls to create order.

218
00:15:40,218 --> 00:15:42,897
I think there might be a cell big enough to hold Appa up ahead.

219
00:15:44,205 --> 00:15:46,166
I think it's through here.

220
00:15:51,113 --> 00:15:53,989
Expecting someone else?

221
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,619
Now that's something different.

222
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,161
You have made yourselves enemies of the state.

223
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:17,346
Take them into custody.

224
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,135
Long Feng is escaping!

225
00:17:23,904 --> 00:17:27,008
Alright Avatar, you've caused me enough problems.

226
00:17:27,043 --> 00:17:31,208
This is your last chance,
if you want your bison back.

227
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:34,138
You do have Appa.
Tell me where he is!

228
00:17:34,173 --> 00:17:35,927
Agree to exit the city now,

229
00:17:35,962 --> 00:17:37,583
and I'll waive all charges against you

230
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:39,204
and allow you to leave with your lost pet.

231
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:42,969
You're in no position to bargain.

232
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,163
Am I not?

233
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,329
You're definitely not!

234
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,497
Jet, The Earth King has invited you to Lake Laogai.

235
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:54,774
I am honored to except his invitation.

236
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:05,993
You're mine now.

237
00:18:10,551 --> 00:18:11,790
Uncle?

238
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:12,791
So, the Blue Spirit.

239
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:17,591
I wonder who could be behind that mask?

240
00:18:18,741 --> 00:18:19,853
What are you doing here?

241
00:18:19,854 --> 00:18:22,998
I was just about to ask you the same thing.

242
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:27,440
What do you plan to do now that you have found the Avatar's bison?

243
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:30,125
Keep it locked in our new apartment?

244
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:32,526
Should I go put on a pot of tea for him?

245
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:34,548
First I have to get it out of here.

246
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:35,872
AND THEN WHAT?!

247
00:18:35,873 --> 00:18:38,427
You never think these things through!

248
00:18:38,428 --> 00:18:40,812
This is exactly what happened

249
00:18:40,813 --> 00:18:43,334
when you captured the Avatar at the North Pole!

250
00:18:43,335 --> 00:18:46,931
You had him, and then you had no where to go!

251
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:48,735
I would have figured something out!

252
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:51,680
No! If his friends hadn't found you,

253
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:53,463
you would have frozen to death!

254
00:18:53,464 --> 00:18:56,022
I know my own destiny uncle.

255
00:18:56,023 --> 00:18:58,102
Is it your own destiny?

256
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:02,333
Or is it a destiny someone else has tried to force on you?

257
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:05,204
Stop it Uncle.
I have to do this.

258
00:19:05,205 --> 00:19:07,624
I'm begging you Prince Zuko!

259
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,677
It's time for you to look inward,

260
00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:14,225
and begin asking yourself the big questions.

261
00:19:14,226 --> 00:19:17,979
Who are you?
And what do you want?

262
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:31,185
Jet, it's me Aang!
You don't have to do this.

263
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:33,474
I'm afraid he no longer has a choice.

264
00:19:43,068 --> 00:19:47,316
Jet, I'm your friend!
Look inside your heart!

265
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:50,433
Do your duty Jet.

266
00:19:53,183 --> 00:19:56,187
He can't make you do this!
You're a Freedom Fighter.

267
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:08,735
Do it! Do it now!

268
00:20:26,776 --> 00:20:30,860
Foolish boy. You've chosen your own demise.

269
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:36,209
I'm sorry, Aang.

270
00:20:36,244 --> 00:20:37,387
Don't be.

271
00:20:51,472 --> 00:20:53,496
This isn't good.

272
00:20:53,497 --> 00:20:56,603
You guys go find Appa.
We'll take care of Jet.

273
00:20:56,604 --> 00:20:58,165
We're not going to leave you.

274
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,148
There's no time.
Just go.

275
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:03,141
We'll take care of him.
He's our leader.

276
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:07,403
Don't worry Katara, I'll be fine.

277
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:15,593
He's lying.

278
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,686
Appa's gone. Long Feng beat us here.

279
00:21:31,687 --> 00:21:34,019
If we keep moving, maybe we can catch up to him.

280
00:21:48,637 --> 00:21:50,443
Do you think we can out run them?

281
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:52,115
I don't think it's gonna matter.

282
00:22:03,266 --> 00:22:04,544
What is it Momo?

283
00:22:15,485 --> 00:22:16,838
Appa!

284
00:22:36,841 --> 00:22:39,326
I can handle you by myself.

285
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,387
Yeah! Appa!

286
00:22:55,388 --> 00:22:56,967
I missed you, buddy.

287
00:23:18,736 --> 00:23:21,087
You did the right thing, nephew.

288
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,375
Leave it behind.
