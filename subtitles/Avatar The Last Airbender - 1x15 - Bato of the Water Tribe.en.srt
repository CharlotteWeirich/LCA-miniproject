00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:13,496
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:17,575
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:21,888
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:25,048
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:29,210
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:31,050
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:36,989
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,612
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

Book One: Water
Chapter Fifteen: Bato of the Water Tribe

15
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:03,537
Hey look! A sword made out of a whale's tooth.

16
00:01:03,575 --> 00:01:06,003
Lemme see that.

17
00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:19,915
This is a water tribe weapon. See if you can find anything else.

18
00:01:20,005 --> 00:01:21,375
Did someone lose something?

19
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:23,688
No, we found something.

20
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:28,319
It's burned.

21
00:01:28,664 --> 00:01:33,241
There was a battle. Water tribe warriors ambushed a group of firebenders.

22
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:38,549
The firebenders fought back, but the warriors drove them down this hill...

23
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:44,476
So then what happened?

24
00:01:44,573 --> 00:01:47,035
I don't know. The trail ends here.

25
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,093
Wait! Look!

26
00:01:49,164 --> 00:01:51,783
It's one of our boats!

27
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,448
Is this... Dad's boat?

28
00:01:54,527 --> 00:02:00,034
No, but it's from his fleet. Dad was here.

29
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:11,524
See, Prince Zuko, a moment of quiet is good for your mental well being.

30
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:17,874
Get back! We're after a stowaway.

31
00:02:17,946 --> 00:02:21,440
There are no stowaways on my ship.

32
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,041
He's paralyzed.

33
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:40,171
Only temporarily. The toxins'll wear off in about an hour.

34
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:42,895
But by then he'll be in jail and I'll have my money.

35
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:45,157
But how did you find him on my ship?

36
00:02:45,227 --> 00:02:48,476
My shirshu can smell a rat a continent away.

37
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:51,866
Well, I'm impressed.

38
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:58,575
Very impressed.

39
00:03:16,102 --> 00:03:17,204
Sokka...

40
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,369
I'm coming with you.

41
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:21,662
You're not old enough to go to war, Sokka, you know that.

42
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,872
I'm strong! I'm brave! I can fight! Please, Dad!

43
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:29,850
Being a man is knowing where you're needed the most,...

44
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:33,918
...and for you right now that's here protecting your sister.

45
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:35,513
I don't understand.

46
00:03:35,574 --> 00:03:42,414
Someday you will. I'm going to miss you so much.

47
00:03:46,544 --> 00:03:49,117
Who's there?

48
00:03:49,193 --> 00:03:49,999
Sokka?

49
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,195
Bato?

50
00:03:51,277 --> 00:03:52,834
Who the what now?

51
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:54,001
Bato!

52
00:03:54,091 --> 00:04:01,723
Sokka! Katara! It is so good to see you two! Oh, you've grown so much.

53
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,056
Hi, I'm Aang.

54
00:04:03,138 --> 00:04:03,716
Where's Dad?

55
00:04:03,788 --> 00:04:04,596
Is he here?

56
00:04:04,684 --> 00:04:10,907
No, he and the other warriors should be in the eastern Earth Kingdom by now.

57
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:16,558
This is no place for a reunion. Let's get inside.

58
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:25,150
After I was wounded, your father carried me to this abbey.

59
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:30,561
The sisters have cared for me ever since. Superior, these are Hakoda's children.

60
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:33,952
They've been traveling with the Avatar. I found them by my boat.

61
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:40,248
Young Avatar, it gives me great joy to be in your presence. Welcome to our abbey.

62
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,712
Thank you! It's truly an honor to be here. If there's anything...

63
00:04:43,758 --> 00:04:46,633
What smells so good, Bato?

64
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,569
The sisters craft ointments and perfumes.

65
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:52,212
Perfume? Maybe we could dump some on Appa?

66
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:57,141
Because he stinks so much! Am I right?

67
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,610
You have your father's wit.

68
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:03,442
Bato! It looks like home!

69
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:06,178
Everything's here, even the pelts!

70
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:11,164
Yeh, nothing's more comforting than dead animal skins.

71
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:19,329
No way! Stewed sea prunes?

72
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,136
Help yourself.

73
00:05:21,212 --> 00:05:24,737
Dad could eat a whole barrel of these things.

74
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:30,058
Bato, is it true you and Dad lassoed an arctic hippo?

75
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:35,432
It was your father's idea. He just dragged me along. Well, the hippo did the dragging.

76
00:05:35,515 --> 00:05:39,259
Hey, I ride animals too! One time there was this giant eel...

77
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:42,282
So who was it that came up with the great blubber fiasco?

78
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:43,801
You knew about that?

79
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:45,213
Everyone does.

80
00:05:45,285 --> 00:05:46,451
What's that story?

81
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:48,484
It's a long one, Aang, some other time.

82
00:05:48,575 --> 00:05:51,618
You and Dad had so many hilarious adventures.

83
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:57,080
Not all of which were hilarious at the time, but everything's funny with hindsight.

84
00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:02,610
Aang, put that down, it's ceremonial and very fragile.

85
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:04,653
Was it you or Dad that put an octopus on your head...

86
00:06:04,736 --> 00:06:07,013
...and convinced Gran Gran you were a water spirit?

87
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:12,900
Your dad wore the octopus, but I did the spooky voice.

88
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,337
Out of my way! Step aside, filth!

89
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:31,749
He means no offense! I'm sure you bathe regularly.

90
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,316
I need to talk to you.

91
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:39,478
Well, if it isn't my new friends, Angry Boy and Uncle Lazy.

92
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:49,621
Your beast trashed my ship. You have to pay me back.

93
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:56,980
Aww, I'd love to help you out, but I'm a little short on money. Drinks on me!

94
00:06:59,147 --> 00:07:02,726
Money isn't what I had in mind.

95
00:07:03,078 --> 00:07:04,908
I need you to find someone.

96
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:07,634
What happened? Your girlfriend run off on you?

97
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:11,505
It's not the girl I'm after, it's the bald monk she's traveling with.

98
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:12,953
Whatever you say.

99
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:18,148
If you find them, I'll consider the damage to my ship paid for.

100
00:07:18,214 --> 00:07:19,248
Forget it.

101
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:22,819
Plus we'll pay your weight in gold.

102
00:07:22,884 --> 00:07:26,583
Make it your weight and we got a deal.

103
00:07:26,658 --> 00:07:27,614
You got it!

104
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,305
Get on.

105
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:46,005
There's something I should tell you kids. I'm expecting a message from your father.

106
00:07:46,062 --> 00:07:46,987
Really?

107
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:47,899
When?

108
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,654
Any day now. Your father said he'd send a message...

109
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:52,593
...when they found the rendezvous point.

110
00:07:52,662 --> 00:07:55,234
If you wait here until the message arrives...

111
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:57,953
...you can come with me and see your father again.

112
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:03,252
It's been over two years since we've seen Dad! That would be so incredible. Katara?

113
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:07,072
I do really miss him. It would be great to see Dad.

114
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,489
It's been far too long, hasn't it?

115
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:15,704
I'm not sure when word will arrive, but when it does...

116
00:08:16,857 --> 00:08:21,352
It would be great, but we can't. We have to take Aang to the North Pole first.

117
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:25,317
Even if we had time to wait for the message, who knows how far we'd have to travel.

118
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:27,377
We don't have time for a long detour.

119
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:30,825
I'm sure your father would understand and be proud...

120
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:34,777
...that his children are helping the Avatar.

121
00:08:37,172 --> 00:08:40,456
I can't believe they would leave me.

122
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:47,087
I'm looking for Bato of the Water Tribe.

123
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:49,396
Uh, I know Bato.

124
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:51,995
Make sure he gets this.

125
00:08:56,005 --> 00:09:00,297
It's the map to Sokka and Katara's Dad!

126
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:17,995
Hey everyone! Sorry I was gone so long.

127
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:20,030
Hey Aang, I didn't notice you left.

128
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:28,452
Yup, but now I'm back. Sure... could go for some delicious sea prunes!

129
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:43,189
Out for a bit of fresh air, are we?

130
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:44,617
We're looking for someone.

131
00:09:44,677 --> 00:09:53,097
I hope it's not Miyuki. Miyuki, did you get in trouble with the Fire Nation again?

132
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:56,867
The Avatar's been through here. Let's keep moving.

133
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:15,807
Aha! I caught you! You should be ashamed of yourself... littering in the courtyard.

134
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:18,772
I'm sorry! I'll take care of this.

135
00:10:23,613 --> 00:10:28,946
This ship is sentimental to me. It was built by my father.

136
00:10:33,764 --> 00:10:36,324
Is this the boat he took you ice-dodging in?

137
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:40,816
Yeh, it's got the scar to prove it. Huh. How about you, Sokka?

138
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:44,123
You must have some good stories from your first time ice-dodging?

139
00:10:44,206 --> 00:10:47,612
He never got to go. Dad left before he was old enough.

140
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:50,080
Oh, I forgot, you were too young.

141
00:10:50,153 --> 00:10:51,507
What's ice-dodging?

142
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,712
It's a rite of passage for young water tribe members.

143
00:10:54,772 --> 00:10:57,720
When you turn fourteen your Dad takes you...

144
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,955
...you know what, you're about to find out.

145
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:13,176
Why are we stopping?

146
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,545
Because the girl must of spent a lot of time here.

147
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:18,068
We have no time for this!

148
00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:22,351
Hey, watch it!

149
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:24,494
Oh look, he likes you.

150
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,341
Care to hear your fortune, handsome?

151
00:11:27,414 --> 00:11:31,186
At my age there is really only one big surprise left,...

152
00:11:31,263 --> 00:11:36,154
...and I'd just as soon leave it a mystery.

153
00:11:39,978 --> 00:11:45,125
Ice-dodging is a ceremonial test of wisdom, bravery and trust.

154
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:49,068
In our village it was done by weaving a boat through a field of icebergs.

155
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:51,724
How are we supposed to ice-dodge without ice?

156
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:56,095
You will be dodging... those.

157
00:11:58,486 --> 00:12:04,967
Sokka, you steer and call the shots. Lead wisely. Katara, you secure the mainsail.

158
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:09,773
The winds can be brutal, so be brave. Aang, you control the jib,...

159
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:15,845
...without your steady hand we all go down. Your position is about trust.

160
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:21,828
I know that! Why wouldn't I know that? I'm the Avatar! I know about trust.

161
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:28,876
For this to be done right I cannot help. You pass or fail on your own.

162
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:37,578
Aang, ease up on the jib. Katara, steady!

163
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:44,347
Aang, less sail! Katara, give him room!

164
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,628
Aang! Helm to lee! Helm to lee!

165
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,701
What does that even mean!?

166
00:13:05,245 --> 00:13:07,615
Great job!

167
00:13:09,693 --> 00:13:11,291
There's no way through!

168
00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:12,476
We can make it!

169
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:15,131
Sokka, you've already proven yourself, maybe we should...

170
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,456
Aang, I'm gonna need air in that sail!

171
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:22,784
Katara, I want you to bend as much water as you can between us and those rocks!

172
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:24,900
Now!

173
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:47,117
The spirits of water bear witness to these marks.

174
00:13:47,195 --> 00:13:53,234
For Sokka, the mark of the wise, the same mark your father earned.

175
00:13:53,307 --> 00:13:58,356
For Katara, the mark of the brave. Your courage inspires us.

176
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:02,111
And for Aang, the mark of the trusted.

177
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:05,500
You are now an honorary member of the water tribe.

178
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:06,626
I can't.

179
00:14:06,703 --> 00:14:08,772
Of course you can!

180
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:11,130
No, you can't trust me.

181
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,184
Aang, what are you talking about.

182
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,994
A messenger gave this to me for Bato.

183
00:14:18,051 --> 00:14:20,350
You have to understand, I was afraid you'd...

184
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:25,694
This is the map to our father! You had it the whole time!? How could you?

185
00:14:25,755 --> 00:14:29,764
Well, you can go to the North Pole on your own! I'm going to find Dad.

186
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,151
Now Sokka, I think you should...

187
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:34,493
Katara, are you with me?

188
00:14:37,162 --> 00:14:40,439
I'm with you, Sokka.

189
00:14:58,418 --> 00:14:59,709
Good luck.

190
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,022
Okay. You too.

191
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,606
Guess I should be moving on.

192
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:12,798
That would be best.

193
00:15:17,637 --> 00:15:20,697
I'm an idiot, Momo.

194
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:42,275
We're getting close.

195
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,807
That wolf sounds so sad.

196
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:54,453
It's probably wounded.

197
00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:59,821
No, it's been separated from the pack. I understand that pain.

198
00:15:59,895 --> 00:16:04,140
It's how I felt when the water tribe warriors had to leave me behind.

199
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:10,903
They were my family and being apart from them was more painful than my wounds.

200
00:16:16,812 --> 00:16:19,000
Sokka?

201
00:16:19,082 --> 00:16:20,316
We need to go back.

202
00:16:20,394 --> 00:16:24,265
I want to see Dad, but helping Aang is where we're needed the most.

203
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,544
You're right.

204
00:16:25,608 --> 00:16:29,792
Your father will understand. And I know he's proud of you.

205
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:30,945
Thanks, Bato.

206
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:34,952
I know where to go from here. Take this in case you want to find us.

207
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:39,017
I'll leave a message at the rendezvous point.

208
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:41,188
Looks like we're going alone, guys.

209
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:43,529
Avatar! You must leave!

210
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:46,443
Okay, I get it. Everybody wants me gone.

211
00:16:46,497 --> 00:16:49,060
A group of people came to the abbey looking for you.

212
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:49,915
Who?

213
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:54,105
A fierce looking woman with a horrible monster and a young man with a scar.

214
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:55,098
Zuko!

215
00:16:55,176 --> 00:16:58,003
The beast was using the scent of a necklace to follow you.

216
00:16:58,082 --> 00:17:02,676
A necklace? Huh! Katara!

217
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:19,470
So this is your girlfriend. No wonder she left. She's way too pretty for you.

218
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:21,957
Where is he? Where's the Avatar?

219
00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:23,983
We split up! He's long gone.

220
00:17:24,035 --> 00:17:26,425
How stupid do you think I am?

221
00:17:26,484 --> 00:17:29,684
Pretty stupid. Run!

222
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:35,461
What are we supposed to do now?

223
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:42,061
It's seeking a different scent... perhaps something that the Avatar held.

224
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:59,583
What's it doing? It's just going around in a circle!

225
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:12,482
Aang!

226
00:18:12,557 --> 00:18:14,411
Up!

227
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:57,952
I'm starting to get some feeling back!

228
00:20:22,912 --> 00:20:25,588
You've got something I want!

229
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,524
That thing sees with its nose. Let's give him something to look at.

230
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:27,593
The perfume?

231
00:21:58,381 --> 00:22:02,421
June! Noooo!

232
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:15,406
Uncle? I didn't see you get hit with the tongue.

233
00:22:20,312 --> 00:22:22,722
So, where do we go?

234
00:22:22,796 --> 00:22:24,651
We're getting you to the North Pole.

235
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:27,715
Yeh, we've lost too much time as it is.

236
00:22:27,777 --> 00:22:29,237
Don't you want to see your father?

237
00:22:29,285 --> 00:22:34,628
Of course we do, Aang. But, you're our family too, and right now, you need us more.

238
00:22:34,711 --> 00:22:36,763
And we need you.

239
00:22:36,824 --> 00:22:41,094
I wish I could give you a little piece of home, Katara. Something to remind you...

240
00:22:41,147 --> 00:22:42,171
I'll be okay.

241
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:48,235
Still, just a little trinket. Maybe something like... this!

242
00:22:48,755 --> 00:22:51,097
Aang, how did you get that?

243
00:22:51,181 --> 00:22:54,411
Zuko asked to be sure I got it to you.

244
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:59,186
Oh, that's so sweet of Zuko. Would you give him a kiss for me when you see him?

245
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:01,648
Sure!

246
00:23:03,744 --> 00:23:08,061
