00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:23,496
We now go live to
our eye-in-the-sky hovercopter

3
00:00:23,564 --> 00:00:25,665
on the scene of that terrible
hovercopter crash.

4
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:26,833
Jim?

5
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,535
The news is not good.

6
00:00:28,602 --> 00:00:33,373
I've just learned that my final
words were "Back to you, Linda."

7
00:00:34,975 --> 00:00:36,743
One for the blooper reel.

8
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:39,012
Oh, the news
is so violent.

9
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:40,947
Let's watch
Rachael Ray instead.

10
00:00:41,015 --> 00:00:43,383
Oh, no, wait,
there might be chopping.

11
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,717
God, what a wuss.

12
00:00:44,785 --> 00:00:47,854
Stop being
such a spineless jellyfish.

13
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,856
You know full well
I am more closely related

14
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,391
to the sea cucumber.

15
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:52,926
Not where it counts.

16
00:00:54,728 --> 00:00:56,095
I hated Jim!

17
00:00:56,163 --> 00:00:59,465
In other news, o our city's
filthy, urine-soaked walls

18
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:00,700
have been desecrated

19
00:01:00,768 --> 00:01:03,703
by a mysterious tile-work
graffiti artist.

20
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:05,405
Police have no leads as to who's

21
00:01:05,472 --> 00:01:08,441
behind this innovative scourge
of public art.

22
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:22,322
That is one sexy
bridge abutment.

23
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:42,208
Free corn?

24
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:43,910
Well, that'll suit me just fine.

25
00:01:56,924 --> 00:02:00,159
The key is knowing
precisely where to strike.

26
00:02:00,227 --> 00:02:01,394
Oops.

27
00:02:01,462 --> 00:02:02,562
Well, well.

28
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,498
Time to beat him his rights.

29
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:07,066
Aah, oh, okay!

30
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:11,271
You know, that don't look
half bad on your buttocks.

31
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:13,907
It does sort of
class up the place.

32
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:20,146
The time is 4:00 A.M.!

33
00:02:20,214 --> 00:02:22,448
We've been arguing
all night, Kif.

34
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:24,250
Can't we go to bed?

35
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:25,885
Is that all you
ever think about?

36
00:02:25,953 --> 00:02:28,187
I'm not just some
piece of tofu, Amy.

37
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:30,857
I need to know where we
stand in our relationship.

38
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:33,559
We're just going
through a rough patch.

39
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:35,194
It is not a patch.

40
00:02:35,262 --> 00:02:37,096
It's been ages, according to
your wildly inappropriate

41
00:02:37,164 --> 00:02:39,365
hunk-of-the-
month calendar.

42
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:40,867
Leave Todd out of this.

43
00:02:40,935 --> 00:02:42,368
Thanks, babe.

44
00:02:42,436 --> 00:02:45,471
Also, today is
Canadian Independence Day.

45
00:02:51,512 --> 00:02:53,079
Oop, that's Bender's ringtone.

46
00:02:53,147 --> 00:02:54,814
I recognize the smell.

47
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:56,149
Hello.

48
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:58,184
Yo, Amy,
I'm in the slammer.

49
00:02:58,252 --> 00:03:01,621
Oh, no.
That's enough lip
out of you, moneybags.

50
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:03,456
Just get five grand
and bail me out.

51
00:03:03,524 --> 00:03:04,991
I don't have that kind of money
laying around.

52
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,426
Yeah, you do.

53
00:03:06,493 --> 00:03:08,528
You know that floor safe
where you keep ten grand?

54
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:10,063
There's five grand in there.

55
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,699
Don't make me wait.

56
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:19,238
Hey, Bender,

57
00:03:19,306 --> 00:03:20,974
you ever kill a
man with a sock?

58
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,275
It ain't so hard.

59
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:27,880
I'd better carve a shiv
for protection.

60
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,353
Rodriguez.

61
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,255
These two brothers
bailed your ass out.

62
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:37,724
Oh, thank God.

63
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,626
Tell me, have things
changed on the outside?

64
00:03:40,694 --> 00:03:42,028
Is food finally
in pill form?

65
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,262
What about pills?

66
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,897
Are they in food form?

67
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:48,101
Hey, hot stuff, I'm Larry
the murder burglar.

68
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:50,436
Hi, Larry,
I like your tattoos.

69
00:03:50,504 --> 00:03:52,338
Amy, that man
is a criminal.

70
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:55,174
I'm just checking out his tats.

71
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,380
Sneato.

72
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:01,714
I have one of my mom.

73
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:04,350
Want to see?
Sure.

74
00:04:11,992 --> 00:04:15,495
I just don't get why
you have to flirt with
every bad boy in sight.

75
00:04:15,562 --> 00:04:17,530
Quit exaggerating.

76
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,401
Nobody move or sweet
cheeks here gets it.

77
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:25,004
Ooh, you're bad.

78
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:29,876
Mama said
Spock you out.

79
00:04:29,943 --> 00:04:31,210
That's it, Amy.

80
00:04:31,278 --> 00:04:32,812
Pardon my language,
but I have had it

81
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,947
with you ruffling my petticoats.

82
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:36,549
You and I are through.

83
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:45,324
Aw, here's a little song
I wrote to cheer you up.

84
00:04:45,392 --> 00:04:49,529
It's called "Let's
Go Already."

85
00:04:49,596 --> 00:04:54,517
CHEWBACCA'S FEET

86
00:04:55,204 --> 00:04:56,600
IRON MAN'S UNDERPANTS

87
00:04:57,136 --> 00:04:59,286
ELVI'S PELVIS

88
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,474
CALCULONS AGENT

89
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:06,045
single,
lonely, and fabulous.

90
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:10,450
Thanks, everybody.

91
00:05:10,517 --> 00:05:12,485
Looks like I'm back
in the game.

92
00:05:12,553 --> 00:05:14,020
Yeah, the game
of old maid.

93
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:17,290
Excuse me, sir,
are those yours?

94
00:05:17,357 --> 00:05:18,624
You're damn right,

95
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:20,159
and before you ask,
this is mine, too.

96
00:05:20,227 --> 00:05:21,427
Where
am I?

97
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:23,262
Is this
TBS?

98
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,564
Tough break, Amy.

99
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:26,099
Are you and Kif
getting divorced?

100
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,267
No, technically
we were Fon-Fon-Rus,

101
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:29,836
so we weren't really married.

102
00:05:29,903 --> 00:05:32,538
Wow, the interesting thing
about that is...

103
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:39,245
So, Amy, how can I phrase
this delicately?

104
00:05:39,313 --> 00:05:42,115
Why did Kif dump you like a sack
of yesterday's turds?

105
00:05:42,182 --> 00:05:44,050
He says I have a thing
for bad boys.

106
00:05:44,118 --> 00:05:45,551
It's so stupid.

107
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:48,354
The truth is
often stupid.

108
00:05:49,756 --> 00:05:52,091
Bender, why do you have
to be so mean to me?

109
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,926
Shut up, baby,
you love it.

110
00:05:53,994 --> 00:05:55,895
Don't tell me to shut up.

111
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:58,131
You know what happened
to the last guy who
told me to shut up?

112
00:05:58,198 --> 00:05:59,499
What?

113
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:02,735
That was great.

114
00:06:02,803 --> 00:06:03,936
Shut up.

115
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:05,771
Oh, yeah,
come over here.

116
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:12,904
Remember, love between a
human and a robot is taboo.

117
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:16,340
We can't tell anyone,
not even our coworkers.

118
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:18,609
Got it. I'll show
the utmost discretion

119
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:21,779
as we get nasty
in this glass tube.

120
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:24,348
Ooh, yeah.

121
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,221
I think I'm coming down
with circus-itis.

122
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,193
I thought circus-itis
only affected children.

123
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,828
Children of all ages.

124
00:06:36,895 --> 00:06:39,964
Bender, old friend,
what's on your face?

125
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:41,766
Uh... blood.

126
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:45,436
Uh, you know...
shaving of the face beard.

127
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:48,439
Amy, are those gear imprints
on your sweatpants?

128
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:51,008
Uh, maybe.
So what?

129
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:53,711
Well, I only brought it up
'cause Bender's wearing them.

130
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:56,314
Uh, I stole 'em from her.

131
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:58,015
Yeah, that's it,
call the cops.

132
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:01,385
Oh, my swollen feet.

133
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:04,522
I'd better take my pills.

134
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,860
Amy, I reckon sweet talk
don't come natural to me,

135
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:10,761
but of everyone
I've ever dated,

136
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:13,097
you are probably
in the top ten.

137
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:16,234
Aw, you always say
just the wrong thing

138
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:18,569
in just the right way.

139
00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:21,339
Sinners!

140
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:24,642
Robosexuality is an abomination!

141
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,511
Oy, this guy.
The good book sayeth

142
00:07:26,578 --> 00:07:29,981
a robot shall not lie down
with a human,

143
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:31,716
nor do it standing up,

144
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:33,851
nor at any angle in between.

145
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,219
Hey, he's right.

146
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:36,687
I don't like this.
...in the good book.

147
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:38,422
Look, a single mother!
Let's get her!

148
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:56,541
<i>Quickly, into
the ship's basement!</i>

149
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,645
Now then,
as you all know,

150
00:08:00,712 --> 00:08:03,581
the county fair
is approaching once again,

151
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:07,418
so I'm preparing my entry
of pickled winds and weathers.

152
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:10,755
I've got sunny, snow flurries,
hail with onions,

153
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:14,625
even my grandmother's
cranberry-raisin typhoon,

154
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:16,294
but no tornado.

155
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:18,296
I'll be damned if I let
Mrs. Girdleson take

156
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:20,264
the blue ribbon again.

157
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:24,268
That's why I need you folks

158
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:27,405
to get out there
and harvest a nice ripe one.

159
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:29,774
This cattle prod
should help.

160
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:31,008
How will that...?
Aah!

161
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:32,210
Get out there!

162
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,814
Is everybody

00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,723
A storm of robosexual marriage

327
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,359
that will rain down
on us like fire.

328
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,261
It's probably a firestorm.

329
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:54,530
If robosexual marriage
becomes legal,

330
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:58,067
imagine the horrible things that
will happen to our children,

331
00:16:58,135 --> 00:16:59,702
then imagine
we said those things,

332
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,504
since we couldn't think of any.

333
00:17:01,572 --> 00:17:04,107
As a mother,
those things worry me.

and Bender stole it,
so we'll start with it.

I support this proposition

she loves me.

is perversion!

You wouldn't
know perversion

366

if it put clamps
on your testicles!
