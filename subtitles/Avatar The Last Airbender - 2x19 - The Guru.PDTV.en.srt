Water

2
00:00:03,941 --> 00:00:04,941
Earth

3
00:00:05,622 --> 00:00:07,235
Fire

Air

5
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:13,413
Long ago,the four nations lived together in harmony

6
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:17,741
then everything changed when the firenation attacked

7
00:00:19,037 --> 00:00:22,687
Only the avatar mastered all four elements could stop them

8
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:25,767
but when the world needed him most he vanished

9
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:29,823
100 years passed, my brother and I discovered the new avatar

10
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,836
airbinder named Aang

11
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,336
And although his airbinding skill is great,

12
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:37,122
he has a lot to learn before he is ready to save anyone.

13
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:40,839
but I believe...
... Aang can save the world

16
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:51,853
There's a man living at the Eastern Air Temple.

17
00:00:51,923 --> 00:00:54,843
He says he can teach me to control the Avatar State.

18
00:00:54,843 --> 00:00:56,150
What's happening?

19
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,629
You're going through a metamorphosis, my nephew.

20
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:02,629
the Dai Li remains loyal to you, Long Feng, sir.

21
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:05,419
Hello?

22
00:01:08,913 --> 00:01:12,541
It is with the highest honor that I welcome the Kyoshi warriors.

23
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:16,137
We are the Earth King's humble servants.

Book two: Earth
Chapter nineteen: The Guru

25
00:01:29,262 --> 00:01:30,664
What's that smell?

26
00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:32,457
It's jook.

27
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,325
I'm sure you wouldn't like it.

28
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:40,438
Actually, it smells delicious.

29
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,042
I'd love a bowl, Uncle.

30
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,848
Now that your fever is gone, you seem different somehow.

31
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,503
It's a new day.

32
00:01:49,635 --> 00:01:51,590
We've got a new apartment,

33
00:01:51,594 --> 00:01:54,498
new furniture, and today's the grand opening of your new tea shop.

34
00:01:54,735 --> 00:01:56,260
Things are looking up,  Uncle.

35
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:06,259
You haven't seen your Dad in over two years. You must be so excited.

36
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:11,159
I know I should be, but I just feel sick to my stomach.

37
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,003
Don't be nervous, he's going to be so happy to see you.

38
00:02:14,323 --> 00:02:15,427
So what about you?

39
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:17,681
Are you nervous to meet this Guru?

40
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:20,581
Not at all. I'm ready to master the Avatar State.

41
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:22,242
I'll do whatever it takes.

42
00:02:24,715 --> 00:02:26,239
See you in a week. Yip Yip!

43
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:45,207
Sokka, good to see you.

44
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Sokka!?

45
00:03:06,683 --> 00:03:08,138
Hi Dad!

46
00:03:15,273 --> 00:03:18,849
Look Bosco, the Kyoshi Warriors are here to protect us.

47
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:21,533
Aren't you excited?

48
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,384
It's been a difficult week for me.

49
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:27,270
My most trusted advisor, Long Feng,

50
00:03:27,271 --> 00:03:31,225
and his Dai Li agents tried to take control of Ba Sing Se from me.

51
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:34,669
It's terrible when you can't trust the people who are closest to you.

52
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,670
But there is good news.

53
00:03:36,354 --> 00:03:37,928
As we speak,

54
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,182
the Council of Five is meeting to plan an invasion of The Fire Nation this summer.

55
00:03:42,183 --> 00:03:44,636
On the day of a solar eclipse.

56
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:46,348
Really?

57
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:50,032
Now that sounds like a fascinating and brilliant plan.

58
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:58,888
General Fong's base will serve as the launching point of the attack.

59
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,000
In exactly two months, the Army and Navy will invade the Fire Nation...

60
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:06,582
on The Day of Black Sun.

61
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,688
Or we could send in Momo to do some damage. Cause the..

62
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,786
Sorry.

63
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:21,072
All we need is the Earth King's seal in order to execute the plan.

64
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,619
I'll get these scrolls to him right away. Thank you, General How.

65
00:04:44,872 --> 00:04:45,942
Hello?

66
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:49,779
You're Guru Pathik, right?

67
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,549
The person who attached the note to Appa's horn?

68
00:04:52,614 --> 00:04:59,683
Indeed. I was a spiritual brother of your people, and a personal friend of Monk Gyatso.

69
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,085
In your note, you said you could teach me to gain control of the Avatar State.

70
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,086
How?

71
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:10,961
You must gain balance within yourself before you can bring balance to the world.

72
00:05:11,174 --> 00:05:14,600
And the first step to gaining balance begins with this.

73
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:16,352
Drink up!

74
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:22,777
It tastes like onion and banana juice!

75
00:05:22,778 --> 00:05:24,722
That's because it is.

76
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:32,500
I believe we need to go right!

77
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:34,267
What are you talking about?

78
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:36,478
The Bei Fong Estate's this way.

79
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,048
I'm quite certain you're mistaken.

80
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:42,645
Can you two old ladies quit your bickering for a second?

81
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:44,636
I gotta go to the bathroom!

82
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:48,946
Okay, but make it quick.

83
00:05:49,936 --> 00:05:51,378
What's wrong with you!

84
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,244
Oh very sneaky Toph! Nice try, but you can't trick me.

85
00:05:58,245 --> 00:06:01,477
Let me out of here, so I can kick both your butts!

86
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:06,178
Quit your banging. You might think you're the greatest earthbender in the world,

87
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:08,566
but even you can't bend metal.

88
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:22,201
We have been presented with an extraordinary opportunity, girls.

89
00:06:22,202 --> 00:06:25,649
Mai finally gets to wear makeup that's not totally depressing?

90
00:06:27,365 --> 00:06:31,703
I'm talking about conquering the whole Earth Kingdom.

91
00:06:31,704 --> 00:06:37,595
For a hundred years the fire nation has hammered away at Ba Sing Se from the outside.

92
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:42,579
But now we are on the inside, and we can take it by ourselves.

93
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,105
Gosh, you're so confident. I really admire that about you.

94
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:52,358
From the inside we're in the perfect position to organize a coup and overthrow the Earth King.

95
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:54,328
The key is the Dai Li.

96
00:06:54,678 --> 00:06:58,537
Whoever controls the Dai Li, controls Ba Sing Se.

97
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:08,658
In order to master the Avatar State, you must open all of the chakras.

98
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,056
Aang, tell me everything you know about chakras.

99
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:14,866
What are chakras?

100
00:07:15,673 --> 00:07:19,741
Oh, I see. I guess we'll start with the basics.

101
00:07:20,426 --> 00:07:25,120
The water flows through this creek much like the energy flows through your body.

102
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:30,164
As you see there are several pools where the water swirls around before flowing on.

103
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,191
These pools are like our charkas.

104
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:37,615
So chakras are pools of spiraling energy in our bodies?

105
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:38,797
Exactly!

106
00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:43,896
If nothing else were around, this creek would flow pure and clear.

107
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:48,345
However, life is messy, and things tend to fall in the creek,

108
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,352
and then what happens?

109
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:52,112
The creek can't flow?

110
00:07:52,113 --> 00:07:53,113
Yes.

111
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:56,596
But if we open the paths between the pools.

112
00:07:56,597 --> 00:07:58,487
The energy flows!

113
00:08:03,728 --> 00:08:06,621
There are seven chakras that go up the body.

114
00:08:06,622 --> 00:08:09,200
Each pool of energy has a purpose,

115
00:08:09,203 --> 00:08:13,140
and can be blocked by a specific kind of emotional muck.

116
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,454
Be warned...

117
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:17,704
opening the chakras is an intense experience,

118
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:23,477
and once you begin the process, you cannot stop until all seven are open.

119
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,381
Are you ready?

120
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,270
I'll do whatever it takes.

121
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:31,949
First we will open the Earth chakra,

122
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,202
located at the base of the spine. It deals with survival ...

123
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:38,408
and is blocked by fear.

124
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:41,376
What are you most afraid of?

125
00:08:41,377 --> 00:08:45,408
Let your fears become clear to you.

126
00:08:57,777 --> 00:08:58,741
Aang,

127
00:08:58,835 --> 00:09:01,020
your vision is not real.

128
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:06,458
You are concerned for your survival, but you must surrender those fears.

129
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:10,564
Let your fears flow down the creek.

130
00:09:13,456 --> 00:09:17,062
You have opened your Earth chakra.

131
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:27,120
Next is the...

132
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:28,121
Water chakra?

133
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:32,601
Brilliant! Maybe one day you will be a Guru too.

134
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:38,286
This chakra deals with pleasure, and is blocked by guilt.

135
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:43,197
Now, look at all the guilt which burdens you so.

136
00:09:43,198 --> 00:09:46,269
What do you blame yourself for?

137
00:09:50,116 --> 00:09:52,049
I ran away.

138
00:10:02,612 --> 00:10:04,515
I hurt all of those people.

139
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:08,388
Accept the reality that these things happened,

140
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:12,719
but do not let them cloud and poison your energy.

141
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,835
If you are to be a positive influence on the world, you need to forgive yourself.

142
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:28,585
This bay leads directly to the outskirts of Ba Sing Se.

143
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:34,020
We've been using these tangle mines to stop the fire nation ships from getting through.

144
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:36,999
You're father invented tangle mines himself.

145
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:42,765
Destructive, buoyant, and ...

146
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:44,963
... terrible smelling.

147
00:10:44,964 --> 00:10:49,444
Very perceptive. The mines are filled with skunk-fish and seaweed.

148
00:10:49,445 --> 00:10:53,626
When a ship detonates the mine, the seaweed tangles up the propeller,

149
00:10:53,627 --> 00:10:57,607
and the foul smell forces people to abandon the ship.

150
00:10:57,789 --> 00:11:00,721
I call it the stink' n' sink.

151
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:03,570
Good one Dad!

152
00:11:03,851 --> 00:11:06,640
You are definitely your father's son.

153
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:10,601
Hakoda, our scouts have spotted four fire nation ships.

154
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:12,749
Bato, get these mines loaded up.

155
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,820
The rest of you men, prepare for battle!

156
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:19,449
What should I do, Dad?

157
00:11:19,623 --> 00:11:23,828
Aren't you listening? I said the rest of you men get ready for battle.

158
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:36,225
Who thought when we came to this city as refugees,

159
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,479
that I'd end up owning my own tea shop.

160
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:44,614
Follow your passion Zuko, and life will reward you.

161
00:11:44,615 --> 00:11:46,391
Congratulations Uncle.

162
00:11:46,392 --> 00:11:48,484
I'm very thankful.

163
00:11:48,485 --> 00:11:53,300
You deserve it. The Jasmine Dragon will be the best tea shop in the city.

164
00:11:53,301 --> 00:11:58,743
No, I'm thankful because you decided to share this special day with me.

165
00:11:58,744 --> 00:12:01,582
It means more than you know.

166
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,147
Now let's make these people some tea.

167
00:12:07,825 --> 00:12:10,846
Yes! Let's make some tea!

168
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:19,000
Third is the Fire chakra, located in the stomach.

169
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:22,647
My Fire chakra would like to eat something other than onion-banana juice.

170
00:12:24,382 --> 00:12:26,250
Good one. Moving on.

171
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:31,956
This chakra deals with will power and is blocked by shame.

172
00:12:31,957 --> 00:12:33,997
What are you ashamed of?

173
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:38,394
What are your biggest disappointments in yourself?

174
00:12:42,057 --> 00:12:44,491
I'm never going to fire bend again.

175
00:12:44,492 --> 00:12:45,839
I can't.

176
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,634
You will never find balance if you deny this part of your life.

177
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:56,309
You are the Avatar, and therefore, you are a firebender.

178
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:08,903
That chakra opened less like a flowing creek, and more like a burping bison.

179
00:13:10,718 --> 00:13:15,289
Tastes like onion and bananas, but strangely something else.

180
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,300
Pickles?

181
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:26,819
I'm tired of wearing this girly disguise.

182
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,340
I don't know how anyone can fight in this.

183
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:33,786
Maybe that's why it was so easy to beat the Kyoshi Warriors and take their clothes.

184
00:13:34,471 --> 00:13:37,287
How much longer do we have to serve the Earth King?

185
00:13:37,288 --> 00:13:41,244
If I have to clean up one more pile of bear poop, I'm gonna throw up.

186
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:46,677
Princess Azula promised we would go back to the fire nation as soon as we captured the Avatar.

187
00:13:46,678 --> 00:13:48,544
We just have to be patient.

188
00:13:48,545 --> 00:13:49,470
Shush up!

189
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:52,396
Do you want the whole palace to know we're Fire Nation?

190
00:13:52,397 --> 00:13:54,240
Sorry.

191
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:06,659
Good work girls.  I am sure the Dai Li will deliver the message.

192
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,602
The fourth chakra is located in the heart.

193
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:15,885
It deals with love, and is blocked by grief.

194
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:20,994
Lay all your grief out in front of you.

195
00:14:44,605 --> 00:14:47,756
You have indeed felt a great loss.

196
00:14:48,826 --> 00:14:52,040
But love is a form of energy,

197
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,468
and it swirls all around us.

198
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,945
The Air Nomads love for you has not left this world.

199
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:06,778
It is still inside of your heart, and is reborn in the form of new love.

200
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:13,993
Let the pain flow away.

201
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:16,125
Very good.

202
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:20,362
Can I have some onion banana juice please?

203
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:27,322
The fifth in the chain is the Sound chakra, located in the throat.

204
00:15:27,323 --> 00:15:31,849
It deals with truth, and is blocked by lies.

205
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,957
The ones we tell ourselves.

206
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,607
Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?

207
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:39,653
Because I never wanted to be.

208
00:15:39,654 --> 00:15:43,023
You cannot lie about your own nature.

209
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:47,183
You must accept that you are the Avatar.

210
00:15:58,536 --> 00:16:05,057
Very good Aang. You have opened the chakra of Truth.

211
00:16:05,977 --> 00:16:12,492
The sixth pool of energy is the Light chakra, located in the center of the forehead.

212
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:17,156
It deals with insight and is blocked by illusion.

213
00:16:17,157 --> 00:16:22,347
The greatest illusion of this world is the illusion of separation.

214
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:28,087
Things you think are separate and different are actually one and the same.

215
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,682
Like the four nations.

216
00:16:29,683 --> 00:16:31,428
Yes

217
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:36,312
We are all one people, but we live as if divided.

218
00:16:36,313 --> 00:16:40,125
We're all connected. Everything is connected.

219
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:45,447
That's right. Even the separation of the four elements is an illusion.

220
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:53,156
If you open your mind, you will see that all the elements are one.

221
00:16:53,157 --> 00:17:00,107
Four parts of the same whole. Even metal is just a part of Earth, that has been purified and refined.

222
00:17:06,997 --> 00:17:12,329
Come on metal.... budge.

223
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:15,657
Toph, you rule!

224
00:17:19,846 --> 00:17:23,015
What do you say Momo? A cup of tea before we get back to the king?

225
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,587
Table for two please.

226
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:32,864
Uncle, I need 2 jasmine, one green and one lychee!

227
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:35,793
I'm brewing as fast as I can!

228
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,177
This is the last chakra isn't it?

229
00:17:48,178 --> 00:17:54,964
Yes. Once you open this chakra, you will be able go in and out of the Avatar State at will.

230
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:57,100
And when you are in the Avatar State,

231
00:17:57,105 --> 00:18:02,726
you will have complete control and awareness of all your actions.

232
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:04,040
Let's do this.

233
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:08,437
The Thought chakra is located at the crown of the head.

234
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:11,685
It deals with pure cosmic energy ...

235
00:18:11,686 --> 00:18:14,303
and is blocked by earthly attachment.

236
00:18:14,304 --> 00:18:18,518
Meditate on what attaches you to this world.

237
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,671
Now, let all of those attachments go.

238
00:18:29,062 --> 00:18:31,789
Let them flow down the river.

239
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,104
Forgotten.

240
00:18:33,105 --> 00:18:38,016
What? Why would I let go of Katara? I...I..I love her.

241
00:18:38,203 --> 00:18:45,481
Learn to let her go, or you cannot let the pure cosmic energy flow in from the universe.

242
00:18:45,482 --> 00:18:48,153
Why would I choose cosmic energy over Katara?

243
00:18:48,154 --> 00:18:51,407
How could it be a bad thing that I feel an attachment to her?

244
00:18:51,408 --> 00:18:53,573
Three chakras ago, that was a good thing.

245
00:18:53,574 --> 00:18:56,708
You must learn to let go.

246
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:03,686
Thank goodness you are here Suki. Something terrible is going on. 

247
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:08,194
The Fire Nation has infiltrated the city. I just saw Prince Zuko and his Uncle!

248
00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:10,279
We have to tell the Earth King right away!

249
00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:14,215
Oh, don't worry. I'll be sure to let him know.

250
00:19:21,904 --> 00:19:28,175
So, Zu Zu's in the city too. I think it's time for a family reunion.

251
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:33,151
I'm sorry, but I can't let go of Katara.

252
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:39,867
Aang, to master the Avatar State, you must open all the chakras.

253
00:19:39,868 --> 00:19:41,738
Surrender yourself.

254
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:43,945
Okay, I'll try.

255
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:51,288
Now, think of your attachments...

256
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:53,633
and let them go.

257
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:57,391
Let the pure cosmic energy flow.

258
00:20:25,175 --> 00:20:27,738
Let me go!

259
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,955
Katara is in danger! I have to go.

260
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,695
No Aang.

261
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:50,934
By choosing attachment, you have locked the chakra!

262
00:20:50,935 --> 00:20:55,145
If you leave now you won't be able to go into the Avatar State at all!

263
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:10,370
It's another one of her tricks!

264
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:13,401
There's a giant whole in the box. How's that a trick?

265
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:15,142
It's not!

266
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:17,013
It's the real deal!

267
00:21:26,044 --> 00:21:31,233
I am the greatest earthbender in the world! Don't you two dunderheads ever forget it!

268
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,892
I'm going to be stuck in here forever with you, aren't I?

269
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:48,858
I have to go to the bathroom.

270
00:21:50,762 --> 00:21:54,019
Ready to go knock some Fire Nation heads?

271
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,086
You don't know how much this means to me dad.

272
00:21:56,087 --> 00:21:59,873
I'll make you proud, and I'll finally prove to you what a great warrior I am.

273
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:04,848
Sokka, you don't have to prove anything to me. I'm already proud of you,

274
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:07,713
and I've always known you were a great warrior.

275
00:22:07,714 --> 00:22:08,714
Really?

276
00:22:08,715 --> 00:22:12,857
Why do you think I trusted you to look after our tribe when I left?

277
00:22:23,684 --> 00:22:25,425
This can't be good news.

278
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:41,004
What is this about? Your agents show up in the middle of the night and drag me down here?

279
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:43,585
You will not treat a Kyoshi Warrior this way!

280
00:22:43,586 --> 00:22:47,056
But you are not a Kyoshi Warrior, are you?

281
00:22:47,057 --> 00:22:49,848
Princess Azula of the Fire Nation!

282
00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:51,332
What do you want?

283
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:56,143
I want to make a deal. It's time that I regain control of Ba Sing Se.

284
00:22:56,144 --> 00:22:58,543
And you have something I need.

285
00:22:59,971 --> 00:23:02,070
The Earth King's trust.

286
00:23:02,071 --> 00:23:03,902
Why should I help you?

287
00:23:03,903 --> 00:23:07,712
Because I can get you the Avatar.

288
00:23:07,713 --> 00:23:09,236
I'm listening.

289
00:23:15,045 --> 00:23:16,652
A message from the royal palace.

290
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,650
I...I can't believe it.

291
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,795
What is it Uncle?

292
00:23:24,308 --> 00:23:26,255
Great news!

293
00:23:26,256 --> 00:23:31,344
We've been invited to serve tea to the Earth King!

294
00:23:40,746 --> 00:23:43,500
