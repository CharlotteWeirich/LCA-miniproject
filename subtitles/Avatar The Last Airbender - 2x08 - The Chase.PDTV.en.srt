Fire

Air

5
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:14,413
Long ago,the four nations lived together in harmony

6
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:18,741
then everything changed when the firenation attacked

7
00:00:20,037 --> 00:00:23,687
Only the avatar mastered all four elements could stop them

8
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:26,767
but when the world needed him most he vanished

9
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:30,823
100 years passed, my brother and I discovered the new avatar

10
00:00:31,113 --> 00:00:32,836
airbinder named Aang

11
00:00:33,157 --> 00:00:35,336
And although his airbinding skill is great,

12
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:38,122
he has a lot to learn before he is ready to save anyone.

13
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:41,839
but I believe...
...Aang can save the world

If I want to catch my prey, I must be agile....nimble.

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,250
I need a small, elite team.

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,550
Even though I was born blind, I've never had a problem seeing.

19
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:03,580
I see with earthbending.

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,215
You're gonna be a great teacher, Toph.

21
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,240
I thought a lot about what you said

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,260
you did?

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,090
good, good

24
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,510
we no longer have anything to gain by traveling

25
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,433
I need to find my own way.

27
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,380
Hey, you guys picked a great campsite.

28
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,790
The grass is so soft.

29
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,840
That's not grass. Appa's shedding.

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,140
Oh, gross!

31
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,120
That's not gross; it's just a part of spring. You know,

32
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,090
rebirth, flowers blooming, and Appa gets a new coat!

33
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,080
Ah, the beauty of spring.

34
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,210
Stop, Appa, stop!

35
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,410
It's not that bad, Katara. It makes a great wig!

36
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:00,850
And a great beard!

37
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:07,740
I'm just glad we finally have another girl in the group because you two are disgusting.

38
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,400
Excuse me, does anyone have a razor? ...because I've got some hairy pits!

39
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,280
So, Toph, usually when setting up camp we try to divide up the work.

40
00:02:35,315 --> 00:02:38,280
Hey, don't worry about me, I'm good to go.

41
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,105
Well, actually, what I'm trying to say is, uh,

42
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,960
some of us might fetch water while someone else might set up the fire pit...

43
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:46,370
... or put up the tent.

44
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,335
Even Momo does his fair share.

45
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,375
Katara, I'm fine. I can carry my own weight.

46
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,790
I don't need a fire, I've already collected my own food, and look.

47
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,480
My tent's all set up.

48
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,290
Well, that's great for you, but we still need to finish...

49
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:03,800
I don't understand. What's the problem here?

50
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,230
Never mind.

51
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,760
Sorry

52
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,595
Hey Toph, I wanted to apologize for earlier.

53
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,960
I think we're all just a little tired and getting on each others' nerves.

54
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,530
Yeah, you do seem pretty tired.

55
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,640
I meant all of us.

56
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,060
Well, goodnight.

57
00:03:31,954 --> 00:03:33,152
Goodnight.

58
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,880
There's something coming toward us!

59
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,220
What is it?

60
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,075
It feels like an avalanche...

61
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,370
But also not like an avalanche.

62
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,310
Your powers of perception are frightening.

63
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,310
Should we leave?

64
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,210
Better safe than sorry.

65
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,080
What is that thing?

66
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,510
Ahh, land, sweet land!

67
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,990
See you guys in the morning!

68
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,850
Actually, can you help us unload?

69
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,720
Really? You need me to help unload Sokka's funky-smelling sleeping bag?

70
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,070
Well, yeah.

71
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,605
That and everything else.

72
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,020
You're a part of our team now and...

73
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,200
Look. I didn't ask you to help unload my stuff.

74
00:04:42,235 --> 00:04:43,530
I'm carrying my own weight.

75
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,920
That's not the point.

76
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,970
Ever since joining us you've been nothing but selfish and unhelpful.

77
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,055
What?

78
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,055
Look here,

79
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,010
sugar queen,  I gave up everything I had so that I could teach Aang earthbending,

80
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,190
so don't you talk to me about being selfish!

81
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,560
Sugar Queen!?

82
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,970
D-Did you just slam the door in my face!?

83
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,620
How can you be so infuriating!?

84
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,340
Should we...do something?

85
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,200
Hey, I'm just enjoying the show.

86
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,425
Okay, okay, you both need to calm down.

87
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,390
Both?  I'm completely calm!

88
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,070
I... can see that.

89
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,590
The stars sure are beautiful tonight. Too bad you can't see them, Toph!

90
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,840
Hey, how is a guy supposed to sleep with all this yelling and earthquaking!?

91
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,000
That thing is back!

92
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:47,170
Well, how far away is it? Maybe we can close our eyes just for a few minutes.

93
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,410
I don't think so, Sokka.

94
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,200
Seriously, what is that thing?

95
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,740
And how does it keep finding us?

96
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,900
I don't know, but this time I'm going to make sure we lose 'em.

97
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,690
Okay, forget about setting up camp.

98
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,305
I'm finding the softest pile of dirt and going to sleep.

99
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,285
That's good, because Toph wasn't going to help anyway.

100
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,555
Oh, I didn't realize baby still need someone to tuck her in bed.

101
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,790
Come on guys, there's something after us and we don't even know what or who it is.

102
00:06:37,825 --> 00:06:41,150
It could be Zuko. We haven't seen him since the North Pole.

103
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:42,150
Who's Zuko?

104
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,920
Oh, just some angry freak with a ponytail who's tracked us all over the world.

105
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:49,430
What's wrong with ponytails, ponytail?

106
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:52,855
This is a warrior's wolf tail.

107
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,680
Well, it certainly tells the other warriors that you're fun and perky!

108
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,930
Anyway, whoever's chasing us, they couldn't have followed us here. So... now would everyone...

109
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,980
just...sshhh!

110
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,310
No, Momo, ssh! Sleepy time.

111
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,505
Aww, don't tell me?

112
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,100
That's impossible.

113
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,370
There's no way they could have tracked us.

114
00:07:20,405 --> 00:07:22,640
I can feel it with my own two feet!

115
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,600
Let's get out of here!

116
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,025
Maybe we should face them.

117
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,840
Find out who they are. Who knows, maybe they're friendly.

118
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,850
Always the optimist.

119
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,290
It's those three girls from Omashu!

120
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,570
We can take 'em. Three on three.

121
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,600
Actually, Toph, there's four of us.

122
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,870
Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't count you. You know, no bending and all.

123
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,220
I can still fight!

124
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,140
Okay. Three on three plus Sokka.

125
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,950
Well, we wanted to find out who they were. We found out. Now let's get out of here.

126
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,330
Appa, yip yip!

127
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,440
I can't believe those girls followed us all the way from Omashu.

128
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,940
I still think we could've taken them.

129
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,350
Are you kidding me?

130
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,120
The crazy blue firebending and the flying daggers are bad enough,

131
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,870
but last time we saw them one of those girls did something that took my bending away.

132
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,280
That's scary.

133
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,970
Oh no, the sun is rising! We've been up all night with no sleep.

134
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,910
Sokka, we'll be okay.

135
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,860
Are you sure!? I've never not slept before!

136
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,500
What if I fall asleep now and something happens? And something always happens!

137
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,820
Every time we land, those girls are there,

138
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,095
so we'll just have to keep flying.

139
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,160
We can't keep flying forever.

140
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,910
So, what's the plan?

141
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,940
Don't know...too tired to think.

142
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,310
I'm sure we'll come up with something after a short nap.

143
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,310
Yes!

144
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,280
Sleep!

145
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,830
What's going on!?

146
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,250
Appa fell asleep!

147
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,270
Wake up buddy!

148
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,010
Appa's exhausted.

149
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,880
Okay, we've put a lot of distance between us and them.

150
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,725
The plan now is to follow Appa's lead and get some sleep.

151
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,310
Of course, we could have gotten some sleep earlier  if Toph didn't have such issues.

152
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,310
What?

153
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,160
Alright, alright! Everyone's exhausted. Let's just get some rest.

154
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,590
No! I want to hear what Katara has to say.

155
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,390
You think I have issues?

156
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:58,280
I'm just saying, maybe if you helped out earlier we could've set up our camp faster...

157
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,600
and gotten some sleep and then maybe we wouldn't be in this situation!

158
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:02,600
You're blaming me for this!?

159
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,550
No, no! She's not blaming you!

160
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,820
No, I'm blaming her!

161
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,750
hey, I never asked you for diddly doo da. I carry my own weight!

162
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,410
Besides, if there's anyone to blame, it's sheddy over here!

163
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,515
What? You're blaming Appa?

164
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,870
Yeah! You wanna know how they keep finding us? He's leaving a trail everywhere we go!

165
00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:27,807
How dare you blame Appa!?

166
00:11:27,842 --> 00:11:29,710
He saved your life three times today!

167
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,950
If there's anyone to blame, it's you!

168
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,595
You're always talking about how you carry your own weight, but you're not! He is!

169
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,930
Appa's carrying your weight! He never had a problem flying when it was just the three of us!

170
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,180
I'm outta here.

171
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,350
Wait

172
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,350
What did I just do!? I can't believe I yelled at my earthbending teacher.

173
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,260
Now she's gone.

174
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,260
I know.

175
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,310
We're all just trying to get used to each other,

176
00:12:10,345 --> 00:12:12,340
and I was so mean to her.

177
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,950
Yeah, you two were pretty much jerks.

178
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,750
Thanks, Sokka.

179
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,205
No problem.

180
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,430
We need to find Toph and apologize.

181
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,390
Okay, but what are we going to do about the tank full of dangerous ladies chasing us?

182
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,090
I have a plan.

183
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,680
Toph was right. Appa's fur was leaving a trail right to us.

184
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,110
But now that he's clean, no more trail!

185
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,747
Are you sure that he's okay to fly?

186
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,835
He'll be fine as long as we leave his saddle and all our stuff here.

187
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,627
I'm going to use Appa's fur to make a fake trail and lead the tank off course.

188
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,330
Ohhh? That really hurt my tailbone.

189
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,370
Wads of wet fur.

190
00:13:30,405 --> 00:13:31,370
How delightful.

191
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,060
Hmm? They're not wads, more like... bundles.

192
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,200
Or bunches? It's got an "uh" sound.

193
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,320
Clumps?

194
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,470
Clumps! They're clumps!

195
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,440
The trail goes this way.

196
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,270
The Avatar is trying to give us the slip. You two head in that direction and keep your eye out for the bison.

197
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,388
I'll follow this trail.

198
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,130
Toph couldn't have made it too far.

199
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,340
What is it Momo?

200
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,870
oh no, katara

201
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,570
How did they find us?

202
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,020
Appa, come on! We need to go faster!

203
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,625
He's too tired!

204
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,210
Not good, not good!

205
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,850
We just need to make it across that river!

206
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,010
oh, no, Appa, just a little further!

207
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,345
We made it!

208
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,255
We're safe!

209
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,130
You did it, Appa!

210
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,260
Good try, but no.

211
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,625
How ya doing?

212
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,660
Well, you know!

213
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,030
I thought when Ty Lee and I finally caught you guys ...it would be more exciting.

214
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,830
Oh well, victory is boring.

215
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,710
Thanks Appa. I don't know what we'd do without you.

216
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,500
Was it just me, or was that guy kinda cute?

217
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,970
Alright, you've caught up with me. Now who are you and what do you want?

218
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:29,190
You mean you haven't guessed? You don't see the family resemblance?

219
00:17:29,225 --> 00:17:31,180
Here's a hint.

220
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,230
I must find the Avatar to restore my honor.

221
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,600
It's okay. You can laugh. It's funny.

222
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,030
So what now?

223
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,080
now?

224
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,990
Now it's over. You're tired and you have no place to go.

225
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:47,360
You can run, but I'll catch you.

226
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,280
I'm not running.

227
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,150
Here is your tea.

228
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,820
You seem a little too young to be traveling alone.

229
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,860
You seem a little too old.

230
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,080
Perhaps I am.

231
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,470
I know what you're thinking. I look like I can't handle being by myself.

232
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,575
I wasn't thinking that.

233
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,060
You wouldn't even let me pour my own cup of tea.

234
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,740
I poured your tea because I wanted to and ...

235
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,835
... for no other reason.

236
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,230
People see me and think I'm weak.

237
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,550
They want to take care of me. But I can take care of myself by myself.

238
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,660
You sound like my nephew.

239
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:45,720
Always thinking you need to do things on your own without anyone's support.

240
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:50,640
There is nothing wrong with letting people who love you help you.

241
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,960
Not that I love you; I just met you.

242
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,230
So, where is your nephew?

243
00:18:58,265 --> 00:19:00,900
I've been tracking him, actually.

244
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:02,680
Is he lost?

245
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,815
Yes, a little bit.

246
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:11,300
His life has recently changed and he's going through very difficult times.

247
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,930
He is trying to figure out who he is ...

248
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:16,375
...and he went away.

249
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,065
So... now you're following him.

250
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,450
I know he doesn't want me around right now,

251
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,570
but, if he needs me, I'll be there.

252
00:19:25,605 --> 00:19:28,290
Your nephew is very lucky,

253
00:19:28,325 --> 00:19:30,360
even if he doesn't know it.

254
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,660
Thank you.

255
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:40,110
My pleasure. Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life's true delights.

256
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,250
No, thank you for what you said.

257
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,080
It helped me.

258
00:19:44,734 --> 00:19:46,188
I'm glad.

259
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:52,140
Oh, and about your nephew? Maybe you should tell him that you need him too.

260
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,420
Do you really want to fight me?

261
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,580
Yes, I really do.

262
00:20:06,615 --> 00:20:07,580
Zuko

263
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,440
I was wondering when you'd show up, Zuzu.

264
00:20:11,158 --> 00:20:12,865
Zuzu?

265
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,390
Back off, Azula! He's mine!

266
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,030
I'm not going anywhere.

267
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,720
Katara

268
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,949
Uncle?

269
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,380
Get up!

270
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,150
I thought you guys could use a little help.

271
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,150
Thanks.

272
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:43,120
Well, look at this. Enemies and traitors all working together.

273
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,674
I'm done.I know when I'm beaten.

274
00:22:46,674 --> 00:22:47,873
You got me.

275
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,180
A princess surrenders with honor.

276
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,150
Get away from us!

277
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,820
Zuko, I can help!

278
00:23:25,728 --> 00:23:26,910
Leave!

279
00:23:35,386 --> 00:23:45,069
