1
00:00:00,792 --> 00:00:03,466
Water,

2
00:00:03,893 --> 00:00:05,239
Earth,

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,046
Fire,

4
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:09,685
Air

5
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:13,925
Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.

6
00:00:13,926 --> 00:00:18,051
Then, everything changed
when the fire nation attacked.

7
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:22,994
Only the avatar, master of all
four elements, could stop them.

8
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:25,654
But when the world
needed him most, he vanished.

9
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:30,111
100 years passed, and my brother and I
discovered the new avatar,

10
00:00:30,146 --> 00:00:31,668
an airbender named Aang

11
00:00:31,703 --> 00:00:34,323
And although his
airbending skills are great

12
00:00:34,324 --> 00:00:37,051
He has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.

13
00:00:37,052 --> 00:00:41,070
But I believe Aang
can save the world.

14
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:48,461
[ Previously on Avatar... ]

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,384
You seem different somehow.

16
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:52,965
Things are looking up,  uncle.

17
00:00:53,283 --> 00:00:57,191
From the inside we're in the perfect position to organize a coup and overthrow the Earth King.

18
00:00:57,367 --> 00:00:59,878
The key is the Dai Li.

19
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,478
I want to make a deal.

20
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:07,218
In order to master the Avatar State, you must open all of the chakras.

21
00:01:07,908 --> 00:01:10,020
Katara is in danger! I have to go.

22
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:11,400
No Aang.

23
00:01:11,422 --> 00:01:14,038
If you are killed in the Avatar state,...

24
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:16,849
... the Avatar will cease to exist.

25
00:01:18,263 --> 00:01:21,793
Book Two: Earth
Chapter Twenty: The Crossroads of Destiny

26
00:01:28,664 --> 00:01:31,217
So, what kind of trouble is Katara in?

27
00:01:31,218 --> 00:01:34,628
I don't know. In my vision, I just knew she needed help.

28
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:39,316
It would be nice if your Avatar powers could be just a little more specific from time to time.

29
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:41,287
What is that?!

30
00:01:46,517 --> 00:01:47,911
Need a ride?
Ahhh!

31
00:01:47,912 --> 00:01:49,272
Oooo!

32
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,271
The Earth King and The Council of Five do not trust the Dai Li.

33
00:01:54,787 --> 00:01:57,102
They imprisoned your leader, Long Feng.

34
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,311
Soon they will turn on all of you, and eliminate you.

35
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:03,842
Seizing power today is a matter of life and death.

36
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,557
The coup must be swift and decisive.

37
00:02:08,057 --> 00:02:11,573
The Earth King, and each of the five generals, must be taken out simultaneously.

38
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:15,588
Long Feng has placed you in my command while we overthrow the government.

39
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:19,898
If I sense any disloyalty, any hesitation,

40
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:23,903
any weakness at all, I will snuff it out.

41
00:02:26,832 --> 00:02:27,940
That is all.

42
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:35,124
Nice speech Azula. It was pretty and poetic, but also scary in a good way.

43
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:38,730
Yeah, I thought you were gonna make that one guy pee his pants.

44
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:43,587
There are still a few loose ends. The Avatar, and my brother and uncle.

45
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:48,817
Many times, I imagined myself here, at the threshold of the palace.

46
00:02:49,446 --> 00:02:53,357
But I always thought I would be here as a conqueror... instead,

47
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:56,873
we are the Earth Kings personal guests,

48
00:02:56,923 --> 00:02:58,508
here to serve him tea.

49
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:01,220
Destiny is a funny thing.

50
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,236
It sure is uncle.

51
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:08,200
So how did it go with the Guru?
Did you master the Avatar State?

52
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:13,825
If you leave now, you won't be able to go into the avatar state at all!

53
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,174
Aang, are you ok?

54
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:20,014
I'm great. It went great with the Guru.
I completely mastered the avatar state.

55
00:03:30,165 --> 00:03:31,868
What's taking so long?

56
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:35,125
Maybe the Earth King overslept.

57
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:40,032
Something's not right.

58
00:03:42,942 --> 00:03:44,446
It's tea time.

59
00:03:44,654 --> 00:03:45,757
Azula!

60
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,604
Have you met the Dai Li?

61
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:51,719
They're Earthbenders, but they have
a killer instinct that is so Firebender,

62
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,892
I just love it!

63
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:59,240
Did I ever tell you how I got the nickname the "Dragon of the West"?

64
00:03:59,341 --> 00:04:02,388
I'm not interested in a lengthy anecdote, uncle.

65
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,420
It's more of a demonstration really.

66
00:04:26,812 --> 00:04:30,474
Come on. You'll be fine.

67
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:35,147
No. I'm tired of running. It's time I faced Azula!

68
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:44,004
You're so dramatic. What, are you going to do, challenge me to an Agni Kai?

69
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:46,363
Yes! I challenge you!

70
00:04:46,364 --> 00:04:47,977
No thanks.

71
00:05:03,158 --> 00:05:06,296
Katara's fine. You have nothing to worry about.

72
00:05:06,297 --> 00:05:10,085
But, in my vision. I felt so sure that she was in trouble.

73
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:13,706
Well, she met with the Council of Generals to plan the invasion.

74
00:05:13,706 --> 00:05:17,334
And since then she's been off with your friends, the Kyoshi Warriors.

75
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:19,164
See Aang? She's with Suki.

76
00:05:19,164 --> 00:05:22,902
They're probably back at our apartment right now,
talking about make up or something.

77
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,693
Ok, maybe you're right.

78
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:30,661
Believe me, if there was any danger at all,
Bosco's animal instinct would sense it.

79
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:41,555
You've got company.

80
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:45,117
Zuko!

81
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,942
Momo!

82
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,047
There's no one else here.

83
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,806
Katara is in trouble! I knew it!

84
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:08,676
Oh no.

85
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:11,405
Wait, someone's at the door.

86
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:14,722
Actually, I know who it is.

87
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:16,197
It's an old friend of mine.

88
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:18,128
Glad to see you're okay.

89
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:20,031
I need your help.

90
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:22,004
Huh uh?!

91
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:29,294
You guys know each other!

92
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:31,736
I met him in the woods once and knocked him down.

93
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:33,898
Then he gave me tea and very good advice.

94
00:06:33,898 --> 00:06:35,482
May I come in?

95
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:41,801
Princess Azula is here in Ba Sing Se.

96
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,265
She must have Katara.

97
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:45,830
She has captured my nephew as well.

98
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:49,630
Then we'll work together to fight Azula, and save Katara and Zuko.

99
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:52,700
Woah there. You lost me at, "Zuko".

100
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:55,712
I know how you must feel about my nephew.

101
00:06:55,712 --> 00:06:59,719
But believe me when I tell you there is good inside him.

102
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,365
Good inside of him isn't enough. Why don't you come back
when it's outside him too, okay?

103
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:10,345
Katara is in trouble. All of Ba Sing Se is in trouble.
Working together is our best chance.

104
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:15,831
I brought someone along who might be able to help us.

105
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,176
Azula and Long Feng are plotting a coup. They're going to overthrow the Earth King.

106
00:07:29,177 --> 00:07:32,329
My sister! Where are they keeping Katara

107
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,402
In the crystal catacombs of old Ba Sing Se, deep beneath the palace.

108
00:07:38,694 --> 00:07:42,508
The movements of all the generals and the Earth King have been plotted out step by step.

109
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:46,622
Good. And the Fire Nation Princess is cooperating?

110
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:51,432
Oh yes! More than cooperating, she's really taken charge.

111
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:54,724
She's terrifying and inspirational all at the same time.

112
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:56,828
It's hard to explain.

113
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:03,717
Why did they throw you in here?

114
00:08:04,836 --> 00:08:06,666
Oh wait. Let me guess. It's a trap.

115
00:08:06,617 --> 00:08:11,340
So when Aang shows up to rescue me,
you can finally have him in your little Fire Nation clutches.

116
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:16,663
You're a terrible person, you know that?

117
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:21,534
Always following us, hunting the Avatar, trying to capture the world's last hope for peace!

118
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:25,450
But what do you care? You're the Fire Lord's son.

119
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:28,567
Spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood.

120
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,086
You don't know what you're talking about.

121
00:08:30,086 --> 00:08:32,797
I don't?! How dare you!

122
00:08:33,302 --> 00:08:35,805
You have no idea what this war has put me through.

123
00:08:36,512 --> 00:08:40,837
Me personally. The Fire Nation took my mother away from me.

124
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,207
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:45,752 --> 00:08:47,957
That's something we have in common.

126
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:56,560
Well whaddya know. There is an ancient city down there, but it's deep.

127
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:04,893
We should split up. Aang, you go with Iroh to look for
Katara and the angry jerk... no offense.

128
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:06,151
None taken.

129
00:09:06,152 --> 00:09:09,561
And I'll go with Toph to warn the Earth King about Azula's coup.

130
00:09:18,493 --> 00:09:22,659
So, Toph thinks you give pretty good advice. And great tea.

131
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,797
The key to both is proper aging. What's on your mind?

132
00:09:29,605 --> 00:09:36,685
Well, I met with this Guru who was supposed to help me
master the Avatar State, and control this great power.

133
00:09:36,686 --> 00:09:40,428
But to do it, I had to let go of someone I love...

134
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:42,173
... and I just couldn't.

135
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,480
Perfection and power are overrated.

136
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,514
I think you were very wise to choose happiness and love.

137
00:09:51,432 --> 00:09:53,869
What happens if we can't save everyone and beat Azula?

138
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:57,845
Without the Avatar State, what if I am not powerful enough?

139
00:09:58,248 --> 00:10:04,159
I don't know the answer. Sometimes life is like this dark tunnel.

140
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:07,882
You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel,

141
00:10:08,472 --> 00:10:10,477
but if you just keep moving...

142
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,097
You will come to a better place.

143
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:25,681
There's General How

144
00:10:37,585 --> 00:10:39,809
Arghh! What's going on here?!

145
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,846
You're under house arrest.

146
00:10:41,847 --> 00:10:45,445
The coup is happening right now! We've got to warn the Earth King!

147
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,829
Thank goodness we're in time!

148
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,216
In time for what?

149
00:11:09,217 --> 00:11:12,231
Yeah, what are you in time for...

150
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,184
cutie?

151
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:18,018
Uh, I'm kinda involved with Suki.

152
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:19,058
Who?

153
00:11:21,762 --> 00:11:23,620
They're not the real Kyoshi Warriors!

154
00:11:25,121 --> 00:11:26,882
Sorry to disappoint you.

155
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:40,260
Ooo, it's like we're dancing together.

156
00:11:41,383 --> 00:11:43,395
This fight... is over.

157
00:11:52,974 --> 00:11:54,976
Get them all out of my sight.

158
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:10,752
Now comes the part where I double-cross you.

159
00:12:10,752 --> 00:12:14,613
Dai Li, arrest the Fire Nation Princess.

160
00:12:16,143 --> 00:12:18,544
I said, arrest her.

161
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:20,637
What is wrong with you?

162
00:12:20,687 --> 00:12:25,367
It's because they haven't made up their minds.
They're waiting to see how this is going to end.

163
00:12:25,402 --> 00:12:27,276
What are you talking about?

164
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:30,000
I can see your whole history in your eyes.

165
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,801
You were born with nothing.

166
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:35,506
So you had to struggle and connive and claw your way to power.

167
00:12:36,118 --> 00:12:42,053
But true power... the divine right to rule... is something you're born with.

168
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:46,752
The fact is, they don't know which one of us is going to be sitting on that thrown...

169
00:12:46,752 --> 00:12:48,757
... and which one is going to be bowing down.

170
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:51,687
But I know. And you know.

171
00:12:53,388 --> 00:12:54,780
Well?

172
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,403
You've beaten me at my own game.

173
00:13:03,404 --> 00:13:07,484
Don't flatter yourself. You were never even a player.

174
00:13:09,027 --> 00:13:11,403
I'm sorry I yelled at you before.

175
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:12,762
It doesn't matter.

176
00:13:12,763 --> 00:13:18,995
It's just that for so long now, whenever I would imagine
the face of the enemy, it was your face.

177
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,427
My face. I see

178
00:13:21,428 --> 00:13:23,767
No, no, that's not what I meant.

179
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:27,067
It's ok. I used to think this scar marked me.

180
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:31,078
The mark of the banished prince,
cursed to chase the Avatar forever.

181
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:38,327
But lately, I've realized I'm free to determine
my own destiny, even if I'll never be free of my mark.

182
00:13:38,328 --> 00:13:41,101
Maybe you could be free of it.

183
00:13:41,102 --> 00:13:41,947
What?

184
00:13:41,948 --> 00:13:43,322
I have healing abilities.

185
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,973
It's a scar. It can't be healed.

186
00:13:48,298 --> 00:13:51,021
This is water from the Spirit Oasis at the North Pole.

187
00:13:51,438 --> 00:13:55,182
It has special properties,
so I have be saving it for something important.

188
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:58,409
I don't know if it would work, but...

189
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:10,049
Aang!

190
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,596
Aang, I knew you would come.

191
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:29,321
Uncle, I don't understand.
What are you doing with the Avatar?

192
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:31,002
Saving you, that's what.

193
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:34,104
Zuko, it's time we talked.

194
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:37,582
Go help your other friends. We'll catch up with you.

195
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:46,962
Why uncle?

196
00:14:46,981 --> 00:14:49,413
You are not the man you used to be, Zuko.

197
00:14:49,663 --> 00:14:54,896
You are stronger and wiser
and freer than you have ever been.

198
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:58,800
And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny.

199
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,027
It's time for you to choose. It's time for you to choose good!

200
00:15:08,358 --> 00:15:13,884
I expected this kind of treachery from uncle, but Zuko, Prince Zuko...

201
00:15:13,884 --> 00:15:17,484
you're a lot of things, but you're not a traitor, are you?

202
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,296
Release him immediately!

203
00:15:19,392 --> 00:15:23,556
It's not too late for you Zuko. You can still redeem yourself.

204
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:27,184
The kind of redemption she offers is not for you.

205
00:15:27,184 --> 00:15:30,000
Why don't you let him decide, uncle?

206
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,080
I need you Zuko.
I've plotted every move of this day.

207
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,044
This glorious day in Fire Nation history.

208
00:15:37,044 --> 00:15:39,624
And the only way we win is together.

209
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:43,136
At the end of this day, you will have your honor back.

210
00:15:43,136 --> 00:15:48,000
You will have your father's love.
You will have everything you want.

211
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,016
Zuko, I am begging you, look into your heart
and see what it is that you truly want.

212
00:15:56,016 --> 00:15:57,864
You are free to choose.

213
00:16:10,856 --> 00:16:12,762
We've got to find Sokka and Toph.

214
00:17:08,284 --> 00:17:10,788
See any Dai Li agents near by?

215
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:12,614
Nope. All clear.

216
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,186
Let's go!

217
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:20,504
I'm not leaving without Bosco!

218
00:18:43,693 --> 00:18:45,197
I thought you had changed!

219
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,480
I have changed.

220
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:22,032
Come on, it's easy. You just walk on your front paws
instead of your rear ones. Like this.

221
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,132
That is a nice trick.

222
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:31,436
Just take the bear.

223
00:19:32,148 --> 00:19:33,463
Bosco!

224
00:20:28,904 --> 00:20:30,707
There's too many.

225
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,872
The only way, is to let her go.

226
00:20:34,872 --> 00:20:36,774
I'm sorry Katara.

227
00:21:51,052 --> 00:21:55,452
You've got to get out of here!
I'll hold them off as long as I can!

228
00:22:54,776 --> 00:23:00,864
We've done it Zuko. It's taken a hundred years,
but the Fire Nation has conquered Ba Sing Se.

229
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,616
I betrayed uncle.

230
00:23:02,616 --> 00:23:04,525
No, he betrayed you.

231
00:23:06,348 --> 00:23:11,100
Zuko, when you return home,
father will welcome you as a war hero.

232
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,600
But I don't have the Avatar.
What if Father doesn't restore my honor?

233
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,706
He doesn't need to Zuko.
Today, you restored your own honor.

234
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:33,699
The Earth Kingdom... has fallen.

235
