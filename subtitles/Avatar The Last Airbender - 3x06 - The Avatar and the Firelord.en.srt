00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,200
katara: water...

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,100
earth...

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,100
fire...

00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,400
air.

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,600
long ago...

7
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,600
the four nations lived
together in harmony.

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,500
then everything changed
when the fire nation attacked.

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,500
only the avatar,
master of all four elements
could stop them.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,100
but when the world
needed him most

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,100
he vanished.

12
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,800
100 years passed and my brother
and i discovered the new avatar

13
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,400
an airbender named aang.

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,600
and although his airbending
skills were great

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,900
he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,000
but i believe aang
can save the world.

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,200
roku: previously on "avatar"...

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,600
i'm losing this war.

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,100
i'm letting
the whole world down.

20
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,500
i should have seen
this war coming,
and prevented it.

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,100
for so long, i thought
that if my dad accepted me,
i'd be happy.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,800
i'm back home now.

23
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,200
my dad talks to me.

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,500
everything should
be perfect, right?

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,000
i should be happy now,
but i'm not.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,800
please, uncle, i'm so confused.

27
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,600
i need your help.

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,200
forget it.

29
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,500
i'll solve this myself.

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,900
waste away in here
for all i care.

31
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,400
aang, it's time you learned
my history with fire lord sozin.

32
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,800
you need to understand
how the war began if you want
to know how to end it.

33
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,000
meet my on my home island on
the day of the summer solstice.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,100
ok, roku.

[footsteps]

36
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,200
you need to know the story of
your great-grandfather's demise.

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,000
it will reveal your own destiny.

38

[growling]

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,300
aang: there it is.

40
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,100
that's roku's home.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,100
katara: but there's
nothing here.

42
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,200
yes, there is.

43
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,500
an entire village.

44
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,300
hundreds of houses.

45
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,200
all completely buried in ash.

46
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,400
azula: it's never too early
for a sitting with
the court painter, zuko.

47
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,000
make sure he gets
your good side.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,800
wait.

49
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,600
i need to ask you something.

50
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,500
what do you remember about
our great-grandfather's history?

51
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,400
ah, zuko.

52
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,500
it's so strange
how your mind works.

53
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,000
fire lord sozin began
the war, of course.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,800
he spent his early years
secretly preparing for it

55
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,100
but he was as patient
as he was clever.

56
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,800
he famously waited
for the comet,
later renamed sozin's comet

57
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,400
and used its power to launch
his full-scale invasion
of the world.

58
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,900
in the end, he died
a very old and successful man.

59
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,500
but how did he die?

60
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,000
didn't you pay any attention
in school, zuko?

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,300
he died peacefully,
in his sleep.

62
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,100
he was ancient.

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,500
what does it mean?

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,500
[gasping]

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,900
the fire sages keep
the secret history in
the dragon bone catacombs.

66
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,100
the final testament
of fire lord sozin.

67
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,400
roku: come, aang.

68
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,000
aang: where are we going?

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,300
to visit my past.

70
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,800
our shared past.

71
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,200
sozin: as i feel
my own life dimming,
i can't help but think

72
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,900
of a time when everything
was so much brighter.

73
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,100
i remember my friend.

00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,700
are you kidding?

78
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,300
the tree root did all the work.

79
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,100
nice one, sozin.

80
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,900
you were friends
with fire lord sozin?

81
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,600
back then,
he was just prince sozin,
and he was my best friend.

82
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,100
[sighing]

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,200
say something to her.

00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,600
uh... [sighing].

85
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,800
love is hard when you're young.

86
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,200
you don't have to tell me.

87
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,000
don't worry.

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,800
it gets better.

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,500
now come with me.

90
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,600
we have a party to attend.

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,200
aang: wait, whose party is it?

92
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,300

shared many things,
including a birthday.

sozin: did something happen
to my father?

00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,500
no, prince sozin.

99
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,000
we are not here for you.

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,300
we are here to announce
the identity of the next avatar.

101

[people whispering]

it is our honor
to serve you, avatar roku.

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,600
the

104
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,300
had to leave the fire nation
and face his destiny
as the avatar.

105
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,700
he needed to travel the world
so he could master
the other elements.

106
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,800
hey, why aren't you packed yet,
all-powerful avatar?

107
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,600
come on, show me how it's done
using all four kinds of bending.

108
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,300
i started packing,
but then the fire sages told me

109
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,900
i won't need any
worldly possessions anymore.

110
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,800
oh.

111
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
it happened so fast.

112
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,600
everything's gonna
be different now.

113

here.

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
i hope you're at least
allowed to have this.

115
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,000
roku: but this is
a royal artifact.

116
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,000
it's supposed to be worn
by the crown prince.

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,200
i want you to have it.

[groaning]

119
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,200
do they have bathrooms
in the spirit world?

120
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,400
as a matter of fact,
they do not.

121
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,500
hey, we're almost at
the southern air temple.

122

this was the first stop
on my avatar journey.

123
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,000
it was the place where i was
trained to master airbending

124
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,200
and also where i met
an old friend of yours,
monk gyatso.

a new glider trick?

i never thought of that.

aang: that's amazing.

135
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,200
i can't believe you
were friends with monk gyatso
just like i was.

136
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,700
some friendships are so strong,
they can even
transcend lifetimes.

137
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:13,300
after my years
mastering airbending, i traveled
to the northern water tribe.

138
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,300
waterbending was
especially challenging for me.

139
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,300
but in time,
i mastered it as well.

140
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,700
[screaming]

141
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,600
i moved on to the earth kingdom.

142
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,500
my earthbending master, sud, was
uncompromising,
stubborn, and blunt

143
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,700
and a lifelong friend.

but the results were worth it.

147
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,400
sozin: twelve long years passed
before i saw my friend again.

148
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,400
when roku returned,
he was a fully realized avatar,
and i had changed as well.

149
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,600
sozin, or should i say,
fire lord.

150
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:41,500
customarily, my subjects
bow before greeting me,
but you're the exception.

151
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,100
roku: after all these years,
he was still my best friend

152
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,500
and a few months later,
he was my best man.

who didn't even know
you were alive.

roku: ta min.

155
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,100
i was persistent.

156
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,800
when love is real,
it finds a way

157
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,600
and being the avatar
doesn't hurt your chances
with the ladies, either.

158
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,200
sozin: on wedding days,
we look to the future
with optimism and joy.

159
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,300
i had my own vision
for a brighter future.

160
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,900
excuse me.

161
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,100
may i borrow him for a moment?

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,900
it's not very traditional,
but ok.

163
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,400
what's on your mind?

164
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,800
i've been thinking hard about
the state of the world lately.

165
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,000
sozin, it's my wedding.

166
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,900
have a cookie.

167
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,200
dance with someone.

168
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,000
lighten up.

169
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,600
i know, i know,
but just hear me out.

170
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,200
right from the start,
i was destined to be fire lord

171
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,200
and although we didn't
always know it, you were
destined to be the avatar.

172
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,400
it's an amazing stroke of fate
we know each other
so well, isn't it?

173
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,700
together, we could do anything.

174
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,600
yeah, we could.

175
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,100
our nation is enjoying
an unprecedented time
of peace and wealth.

176
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
our people are happy, and we're
so fortunate in so many ways.

177
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
where are you going with this?

178
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,500
i've been thinking.

179
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,800
we should share this prosperity
with the rest of the world.

180
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,000
in our hands is the most
successful empire in history.

181
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,800
it's time we expanded it.

182
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,200
no

183
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,200
the four nations are meant
to be just that: four.

184
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,500
roku, you haven't even stopped
to consider the possibilities.

185
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,300
there are no possibilities.

186
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,600
this is the last i want
to hear about this.

187
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,200
roku: that was my first
real test as the avatar.

188
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,700
unfortunately, it was many years
before i learned that sozin

189
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,100
had gone ahead with his plan,
despite my warning.

190
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,500
i've seen the colony, sozin.

191
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,600
how dare you occupy
earth kingdom territory.

192
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:11,000
sozin: how dare you,
a citizen of the fire nation,
address your fire lord this way?

193
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,200
your loyalty is
to our nation first.

194
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,200
anything less
makes you a traitor.

195
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,300
don't do this, sozin.

196
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,100
don't challenge me.

197
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,100
it will only end badly.

198
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,300
it's over.

199
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,700
[grunting]

200
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,600
[screaming]

201
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,100
i'm sparing you, sozin.

202
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,800
i'm letting you go in the name
of our past friendship

203
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,800
but i warn you, even a single
step out of line will result
in your permanent end.

204
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,500
and k or see each other

205
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,300
for 25 years after our battle.

206
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,300
i spent most of my spare time
here at my home.

207
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,500
[whooshing noise]

208
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,900
[coughing]

209
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,700
roku: let's go.

210
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
sozin: roku's island
was 100 miles away.

211
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,400
but i could still
feel it rumbling

212
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,300
and see the black plume
of smoke.

213
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,600
i had never seen anything
like this catastrophe.

214
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,300
aang: this is amazing, roku.

215
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,700
you're battling a volcano,
and you're winning.

216
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,500
unfortunately, my success
didn't last, aang.

217
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,000
there was no way
i could do it all.

218
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,700
ruko: battling the elements
was hard enough

219
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,400
i had to do it while
i could barely breathe.

220
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,900
the poisonous, volcanic gasses
were overwhelming.

221
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,500
[thunder crashes]

222
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,900
[howls]

223
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,800
it's all right, fang.
[coughs]

224
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,200
get out of here, i'm fine.

225
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,800
sozin: need a hand, old
friend?

226
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,000
sozin?

227
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,700
there's not a moment to waste.

228
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,600
[thunder crashes]

229
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,400
[gasps]

230
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,400
ruko: don't breathe
the toxic gas.

231
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,700
[coughs]

232
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,600
it's... too much.

233
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,800
[gasps and coughs]

234
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,500
please...

235
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,600
without you, all my plans
are suddenly possible.

236
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,000
i have a vision
for the future, roku.

237
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,500
[coughing.]

238
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,900
[screeches]

239
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,900
[baby cries]

240
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,500
aang: who's, wait,
that's me, isn't it?

241
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,600
ruko: make sense of
our past, aang.

242
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,700
and you will bring peace
and restore balance
in the world.

243
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,000
aang: roku?

244
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,000
roku...

245
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,400
sozin: with roku gone,
and the great comet returning

246
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,200
the timing was perfect
to change the world.

247
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,800
i knew the next avatar
would be born an air nomad

248
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,200
so i wiped out the air temples.

249
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,000
but somehow,
the new avatar eluded me.

250
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,800
i wasted the remainder of
my life searching in vain.

251
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,000
i know he's hiding
out there somewhere

252
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,300
the fire nation's
greatest threat.

253
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,300
the last airbender.

254
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,600
that can't be it,
where's the rest of it?

255
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
you sent this, didn't you?

256
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,900
i found the secret history.

257
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,600
which, by the way,
should be renamed "the history
most people already know."

258
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,400
the note said that
i needed to know about my
great-grandfather's death

259
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,200
but he was still alive
in the end.

260
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,300
no, he wasn't.

261
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,800
what are you talking about?

262
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,200
iroh: you have more than one
great-grandfather, prince zuko.

263
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,600
sozin was your
father's grandfather.

264
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:49,400
<i>your mother's grandfather
was avatar roku.</i>

265
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,600
why are you telling me this?

266
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,600
because understanding
the struggle between
your two great-grandfathers

267
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,300
can help you better understand
the battle within yourself.

268
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,000
evil and good are always
at war inside you, zuko

269
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,900
it is your nature, your legacy.

270
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,400
but there is a bright side.

271
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,100
what happened generations ago
can be resolved now.

272
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,700
by you.

273
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,900
because of your legacy,
you alone can cleanse the sins
of our family

274
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,100
and the fire nation.

275
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,700
born in you,
along with all this strife

276
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,800
is the power to restore balance
to the world.

277
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,700
this is a royal artifact.

278
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,900
it's supposed to be worn
by the crown prince.

279
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,300
katara: you mean,
after all roku and sozin
went through together

280
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,800
even after roku
showed him mercy,
sozin betrayed him like that?

281
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,800
<i>it's like these people
are born bad.</i>

282
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,000
aang: no, that's wrong.

283
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,200
i don't think that was the point
of what roku showed me at all.

284
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,500
then what was the point?

285
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,900
roku was just as much
fire nation as sozin was, right?

286
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,100
if anything, their story proves
anyone's capable of
great good and great evil.

287
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,700
everyone, even the fire lord
and the fire nation

288
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,200
have to be treated like
they're worth giving a chance.

289
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,300
and i also think it was
about friendships.

290
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:30,200
do you really think friendships
can last more than one lifetime?

291
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,400
i don't see why not.

292
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,300
sokka: well, scientifically
speaking, there's no way
to prove that-

293
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,700
oh, sokka, just hold hands.
