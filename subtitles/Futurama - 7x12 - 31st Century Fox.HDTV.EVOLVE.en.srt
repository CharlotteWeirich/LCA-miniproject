00:00:25,308 --> 00:00:27,142
How was the delivery to Tokyo?

5
00:00:27,177 --> 00:00:30,612
Not bad... Mothzilla got into
the ship's closet, though.

6
00:00:30,646 --> 00:00:33,815
Can we please get
new uniforms now, Professor?

7
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,418
You said you would replace them
a year ago.

8
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:39,955
You can't expect me to honor
what year-ago Professor said.

9
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,124
That guy was young and foolish.

10
00:00:42,158 --> 00:00:43,658
There's nothing wrong
with these uniforms

11
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:46,595
that a few denim
patches won't fix.

12
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,598
(Professor and
hermes screaming)

13
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,101
Oh, all right.

14
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,036
To the garment district.

00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,677
(Door opens, bell jingles)

16
00:01:02,712 --> 00:01:04,947
Come in, come in.

17
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:08,250
Can I offer you maybe a nice
macaroon cut in seven pieces?

18
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:10,852
Oy, such a stereotype.

19
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:14,256
Yes, I'm looking for
something in a space uniform

20
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,458
that's respectfully humiliating

21
00:01:16,492 --> 00:01:18,427
but can come out of
an employee's salary

22
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:19,929
without his noticing.

23
00:01:19,963 --> 00:01:21,130
You got it.

24
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,199
Tomorrow's clothes
at yesterday's prices.

25
00:01:24,234 --> 00:01:27,636
Ah, you can't go wrong
with a stillsuit.

26
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,606
It recycles your solid waste
into a nice piece gefilte fish.

27
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:35,244
Ugh, is there a way to just
keep it as solid waste?

28
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:39,881
Now here's something
we can all agree on.

29
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,050
(Shudders)

30
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:44,219
Ah, the Stardoz 2293.

31
00:01:44,254 --> 00:01:46,655
Not for everybody,
but you pull it off.

32
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,690
Please don't pull it off.

33
00:01:48,724 --> 00:01:50,326
Yo, squidward scissorhands,

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,727
you got this
in an adult robot medium?

35
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:54,396
The foxhunting uniform?

36
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:57,333
You, sir, must be a
robot of noble bearings.

37
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,802
Well, I am descended
from prince Albert's can.

38
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:02,071
I think we've seen enough.

39
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,739
Too much, actually.

40
00:02:04,774 --> 00:02:06,641
Come on, let's try
somewhere else.

41
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:10,045
Wait, wait, perhaps discerning
customers like yourselves

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,881
would be interested in an item
from our discount rack.

43
00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:15,217
Quality <i>is</i>
the most important thing.

44
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:16,518
How much is it?

45
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:18,020
90% off.

46
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:21,390
An unpleasant fellow ordered
them last year but never paid.

47
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:23,258
Most unpleasant, that one.

48
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:26,261
That sounds like something
year-ago Professor would do.

49
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:28,197
We'll take them.

50
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:38,573
Finally, a uniform I'd be
happy to be caught dead in.

51
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:41,010
And, boy, does it
wick away moisture...

52
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:42,944
gallons and gallons of it.

53
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:44,713
Plus, they're stitched
in such a way that,

54
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,515
no matter what angle
it's viewed from,

55
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:49,351
it looks like you're standing
in hero wind.

56
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:52,187
I just wish my fists
weren't sewn to my belt.

57
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:54,123
(Grunts)

58
00:02:54,157 --> 00:02:56,791
Hey, what's Bender wearing
instead of that crap?

59
00:02:56,826 --> 00:02:58,027
Oh, lord.

60
00:02:58,061 --> 00:02:59,961
Did you actually buy
that getup?

61
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:03,399
We foxhunters do not stoop
to buy getups.

62
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,866
I made free with it.

63
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:08,737
Since when do you care... or
even know... about foxhunting?

64
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,939
Foxhunting is an ancient
and noble pursuit

65
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:12,141
that's fascinated me

66
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:15,044
ever since I first heard of it
ten minutes ago.

67
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:16,412
Noble pursuit?

68
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,148
What's noble about killing
a defenseless animal?

69
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:20,949
Don't be naive, Leela.

70
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:23,318
We kill defenseless
animals all the time.

71
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:25,320
Look at Hermes's
tortoise-shell glasses.

72
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:28,290
The Professor's
walrus-ivory teeth,

73
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:30,926
and don't forget the
zebra-fur ship cozy.

74
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,428
(Overlapping chatter)
Yeah, I guess you're right.

75
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,728
He's got a point.

76
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:37,166
See, Leela, there are two
sides to every shameful act.

77
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,101
What you call the
atrocity of crazed dogs

78
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,470
tearing a helpless
fox to shreds,

79
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:43,472
others call a pleasant
jaunt in the park.

80
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:44,673
The first thing.

81
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:46,108
Come see for yourself.

82
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:50,145
Join me on the morrow as I
embark on my maiden hunt.

83
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,613
I said join me!

84
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,991
This is my best
protest sign ever,

85
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:04,926
and it was easy
because I started

86
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:07,463
with a "save the ox" sign
I already had.

87
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,598
(Horse neighs)

88
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:11,600
Wow, where'd you get the horse?

89
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:13,535
None of your business.

90
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:27,015
Young man, one does not drink
from a champagne fountain

91
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:28,217
in that manner.

92
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:29,485
But he's doing it.

93
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:34,356
(Chuckles)

94
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,957
Check out this dork.

95
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:38,560
I, sir, am the master
of the hunt

96
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:41,463
and I'll thank you
to behave like a gentleman.

97
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:43,165
You're quite welcome, sir.

98
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,167
(Belches)

99
00:04:48,738 --> 00:04:50,705
Ah, yes, foxhunting.

100
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,809
If there's one thing I know,
it's everything about it.

101
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:56,378
What's that weird cat?

102
00:04:56,412 --> 00:05:00,482
(Groans) This is the fox
we'll be hunting today.

103
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:02,317
Wow, this is easier
than I thought.

104
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:04,886
The sport is in the chase, sir.

105
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,922
The fox gets
a 30-minute head start.

106
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:14,763
Man, it would have been
so much easier

107
00:05:14,797 --> 00:05:16,632
to kill it in the cage.

108
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:21,170
(Buzzes)

109
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:24,939
Let the hunt begin.

110
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:26,941
(Barking)

111
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,612
(Whooping raucously)

112
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:35,450
Stop, this is cruel
and inhumane.

113
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:38,753
Well, now, in all my years
as a huntmaster

114
00:05:38,788 --> 00:05:40,955
I've never seen
anything like this.

115
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,624
I mean, look at that sign.

116
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:44,393
It's magnificent.

117
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,195
(Chuckling):
Oh, thank you.

118
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:47,563
I used a ruler

119
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,399
and I erased all the pencil
lines when I was finished.

120
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,600
Charming.

121
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:52,801
Now, into the ditch with you.

122
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:53,968
(Screams)

123
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:58,407
(Barking)

124
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:02,311
So the dogs do all the work

125
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:04,813
while we sportsmen enjoy
a nice horsey ride?

126
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:06,047
Precisely.

127
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:08,049
I see you've caught the fever.

128
00:06:08,084 --> 00:06:09,451
Keep your wits about you.

129
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:12,120
I've blanketed these
woods with devious traps

130
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:15,123
to ward off poachers
and protesters.

131
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:17,292
Stop the bloodshed,
stop the violence.

132
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:18,493
(Screams)

133
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:19,794
(Laughs)

134
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:23,765
I saw that coming
from a mile away...!

135
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:26,935
(Horse neighing)

136
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,003
(Chuckles)
Be more careful, friend.

137
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,308
My antigravity snares
are virtually undetectable.

138
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:35,477
I saw it coming from a mile a...

139
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:37,779
(Bender grunts, horse neighs)

140
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:40,449
View halloo, view halloo.

141
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,117
View halloo?
All right.

142
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,318
What does that mean?

143
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:44,953
The fox has been sighted.

144
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:49,791
(Barking)

145
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:51,693
Oh, yeah, get that fox.

146
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:53,262
Go, dogs, go.

147
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:55,697
(Barking)

148
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:58,600
(Horses neigh)

149
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:02,103
Eh, either way.

150
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:04,306
(Fox whimpering, dogs barking)

151
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:13,815
Oh, God, this is horrible.

152
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:15,317
I can't watch.

153
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,186
(Scoffs) You humans always say
you don't want to see violence,

154
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,488
but you know you do.

155
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,423
I defy you not to watch.

156
00:07:28,765 --> 00:07:30,799
A robot fox?

157
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:34,503
Huh, I guess I'm okay
with this after all.

158
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,204
Well, I'm not.

159
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:39,408
Robot foxhunting is a crime
against robo-nature.

160
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:41,510
Stop the bloodshed,
stop the viol...

161
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,644
(Screams)

162
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,267
(Growling)

163
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,771
How can you do this to a poor,
defenseless robot animal?

164
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:54,241
You people are sick, and
you foxhounds are no better.

165
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:55,910
They're not foxhounds.

166
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:58,445
They're springer spaniels,
you twit.

167
00:08:00,015 --> 00:08:02,850
Or rather
spring-powered spaniels.

168
00:08:02,884 --> 00:08:05,485
(Gasps)
Bot-on-bot violence?

169
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,687
Where will it end?

170
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:07,855
Not with the dogs.

171
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:09,089
Come here, sea gasket.

172
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:11,592
(Neighs)

173
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:17,031
Hyah!
(Neighs)

174
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,467
No!

175
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,770
You, sir, are
a heartless monster,

176
00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:25,338
and you will rue
the day you met me.

177
00:08:25,373 --> 00:08:28,576
Also, can I get
my parking validated?

178
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:37,718
The time has come to end
injustice against robot animals.

179
00:08:37,752 --> 00:08:39,720
(Cheering)

180
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:42,990
No dog track rabbit should be
used to test cosmetics,

181
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,992
no robot cow
should have to be milked

182
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:46,727
by a milking machine,

183
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:50,030
and no milking machine
should have to milk a robot cow.

184
00:08:50,065 --> 00:08:52,633
Those injustices
don't even exist.

185
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,435
Then, let's find some that do.

186
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,012
Robot chickens weren't made
to be jammed in cubicles

187
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:06,714
and forced to lay eggs.

188
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:08,515
Actually, they was.

189
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:12,419
(Clucking)

190
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:14,088
I'll save you.

191
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:17,290
Run free, sweet robo-hen.

192
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:20,995
(Clucks)

193
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,936
Enough with the tenderizing.

194
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,204
It's time for a Benderizing.

195
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:33,941
Hey, you people
can't just burst in like that

196
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:35,175
and cut off my hand.

197
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:36,510
You got to take a number.

198
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:50,457
Shooting innocent robot ducks
is wrong.

199
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:51,692
Fly away.

200
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:53,460
Fly away, my pretties.

201
00:09:53,494 --> 00:09:56,396
(Squawks)

202
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,565
(Cheering)

203
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,567
Congratulations, Bender,

204
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,202
you've ended robot
animal cruelty

205
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:04,938
within a 20-yard radius
of this building.

206
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:06,406
You ready to call it a day,

207
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,309
or do you have one
more score to settle?

208
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,611
The second thing.

209
00:10:11,646 --> 00:10:12,813
(Whimpers)

210
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:14,081
Huntmaster:
The weekly hunt

211
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:15,883
is hereby called to order.

212
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:17,084
(Enthusiastic chatter)

213
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:19,252
I'll drink some more to that.

214
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:21,388
As always, once I
release the fox,

215
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:23,223
it will have a 30-minute
head start before...

216
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:24,457
(Clattering)

217
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:25,659
(Angry chatter)

218
00:10:25,694 --> 00:10:26,827
Stop the hunt.

219
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:30,497
Oh! You again.

220
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:32,766
I'm back, snooty.

221
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:35,169
We're here to liberate
that robot fox,

222
00:10:35,203 --> 00:10:37,104
and that's what we're gonna do.

223
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:39,239
(Grunting)

224
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:41,909
Uh, you mind showing me
how to open the cage?

225
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:45,278
Now, listen here, the hunt
is a hallowed tradition,

226
00:10:45,313 --> 00:10:48,115
and you Bambi-loving
beatniks will never stop it.

227
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:49,316
Oh, no?

228
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,684
Well, for your information,

229
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:54,287
the robot fox has been declared
an endangered robo-species.

230
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:58,258
This injunction suspends all
robot foxhunting for 24 hours

231
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:00,527
while our motion
is under consideration.

232
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:03,697
We'll see you in court.

233
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:05,199
(Banging)

234
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,038
Motion destroyed.

235
00:11:11,072 --> 00:11:13,974
The hunt shall resume at sunup.

236
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:15,776
(Neighing)

237
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:19,412
He's crooked, but fair.

238
00:11:21,883 --> 00:11:23,784
I'm not giving up yet.

239
00:11:23,818 --> 00:11:25,518
I am.
I already did.

240
00:11:25,553 --> 00:11:26,987
You can count on me.

241
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,455
Now here's the plan.

242
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:31,125
We're going to sneak onto the
grounds and free that fox.

243
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,326
Can we stop for ice cream
on the way back?

244
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:34,962
All right, fine.

245
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:36,830
And on the way there?

246
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,836
(Whispering): Okay, I'll hold the
ice cream while you two go over.

247
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:46,974
(Grunting)

248
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:49,743
Where's the ice cream?

249
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:51,745
(Whispers):
There was a bear.

250
00:11:52,881 --> 00:11:55,916
(Grunting)

251
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,918
(Beep)

252
00:11:57,952 --> 00:12:00,687
Okay. You guys take him
back to planet express.

253
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:04,057
I've got one more shenanigan
up my sleeve.

254
00:12:04,092 --> 00:12:06,393
But you promised us
way-back ice cream.

255
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:07,594
Oh, here.

256
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:10,430
But no chocolate...
it's bedtime.

257
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:16,103
With that odious robot
barred from the grounds,

258
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:19,606
the weekly hunt is hereby called
once more to order.

259
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,241
Let the hunt begin.

260
00:12:21,276 --> 00:12:22,575
(Other gasping)

261
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,911
(Shocked murmuring)

262
00:12:23,945 --> 00:12:27,047
You, sir, have been outfoxed.

263
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,117
I spent all night on that.

264
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:31,351
It's clever.

265
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:34,221
Nevertheless,
I demand you return my fox.

266
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:35,722
Sorry, mutton-chump.

267
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,624
No fox, no hunt.

268
00:12:37,658 --> 00:12:39,559
Oh, really?

269
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:40,760
(Beep)

270
00:12:40,795 --> 00:12:43,230
(Gun cocks)

271
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:44,798
Let the hunt begin!

272
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,968
(Other agreeing)

273
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,373
Sir, I leave you
with this one final thought.

274
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,242
(Panicked screaming)

275
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:57,410
(Screaming continues)

276
00:12:59,743 --> 00:13:01,463
Oh, God, they're gonna kill me

277
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:03,621
El roboto mas importante.

278
00:13:04,128 --> 00:13:06,296
And I only have
a 30 minute head start.

279
00:13:06,331 --> 00:13:07,964
Uh-oh, a fork in the path.

280
00:13:07,998 --> 00:13:10,233
Hmm.

281
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:12,469
There's more places to hide
in that dark forest.

282
00:13:12,503 --> 00:13:15,739
On the other hand, I could run
faster through that open meadow.

283
00:13:15,773 --> 00:13:17,307
But of course,
the forest might protect

284
00:13:17,342 --> 00:13:19,976
my fair robot skin from sunburn.

285
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,512
Hmm...

286
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:25,716
(Buzzer sounds)

287
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,385
(Bugle plays, dogs barking)

288
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,456
Today, we hunt the most
dangerous game...

289
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,324
aside from lawn darts...

290
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:38,928
a cunning robotic adversary
so deviously clever that...

291
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:41,164
Oh, for God's sake.

292
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:42,932
Then again, a nice
run through a meadow,

293
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:44,901
who could say no to that?

294
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:46,770
What...?!
(Barking)

295
00:13:46,804 --> 00:13:48,338
(Snarling, Bender whimpering)

296
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:50,807
Look here.
Hunting is a team effort,

297
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:52,409
and you're not pulling
your weight.

298
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:53,943
Now I'm going to be sporting

299
00:13:53,978 --> 00:13:56,680
and give you one more chance
to run.

300
00:13:56,714 --> 00:13:57,947
Thanks.

301
00:13:57,982 --> 00:14:00,517
Nothing's more important
than sportsmanship.

302
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:01,852
Ow!

303
00:14:01,886 --> 00:14:03,019
(Laughs deviously)

304
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:05,021
(Slurping)

305
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,123
It's so cute.

306
00:14:07,157 --> 00:14:09,025
Horseshoe crab cute.

307
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:10,927
(Fry laughs, others murmuring)

308
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,366
Fox news, everyone.

309
00:14:16,401 --> 00:14:20,537
I've decided to make the fox
our new corporate mascot.

310
00:14:20,571 --> 00:14:21,538
Hear, hear.

311
00:14:21,572 --> 00:14:23,373
Let's put on our new uniforms

312
00:14:23,408 --> 00:14:26,042
and take a staff photo
for the newsletter.

313
00:14:26,076 --> 00:14:27,210
Right on!

314
00:14:27,244 --> 00:14:30,046
Here they are,
freshly laundered and...

315
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,348
(Hermes gasps, fox snarling)

316
00:14:32,383 --> 00:14:33,850
(Other gasping)

317
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:35,184
(Panting)

318
00:14:35,219 --> 00:14:39,155
Our magnificent uniforms...
they're ruined.

319
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:40,490
(Sobbing)

320
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:42,559
And he peed on the
locker room floor.

321
00:14:42,593 --> 00:14:44,661
That's my territory.

322
00:14:44,695 --> 00:14:46,229
Also got in the henhouse

323
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:48,998
and killed Amy's prize-winning
Rhode Island red.

324
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:51,067
Not Penelope.

325
00:14:51,101 --> 00:14:54,404
Cute or not,
I'll kill that robo-rat.

326
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:55,572
(Amy yells, fox whimpers)

327
00:14:55,606 --> 00:14:58,241
(Fry screams)

328
00:14:58,275 --> 00:15:00,076
Fry:
Let me at it.

329
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,378
I'm gonna pound it
with this chewed-up old stick.

330
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:03,580
Leela:
No!

331
00:15:03,614 --> 00:15:05,816
It's just a poor, scared
wild robot.

332
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,050
What did you expect?

333
00:15:07,084 --> 00:15:08,217
(Gasps)

334
00:15:08,252 --> 00:15:10,754
My sign.
It's ruined.

335
00:15:10,788 --> 00:15:12,088
Kill the fox.

336
00:15:12,122 --> 00:15:14,925
(Leela grunting)

337
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,761
(Angry shouting)

338
00:15:17,795 --> 00:15:19,162
(Panting)

339
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:22,599
(Whimpers)

340
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:26,503
(Explosion)

341
00:15:28,238 --> 00:15:31,107
Missed it by that much.

342
00:15:31,141 --> 00:15:33,409
(Dogs barking)

343
00:15:33,444 --> 00:15:34,744
(Panting)

344
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:36,947
Oh, no, they caught my scent.

345
00:15:36,981 --> 00:15:39,449
I better throw them off by
rubbing myself with something.

346
00:15:40,585 --> 00:15:42,619
(Scratching)

347
00:15:42,653 --> 00:15:44,387
Ow! That's no good.

348
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:47,624
Wait, I know what'll confuse
those dogs.

349
00:15:47,658 --> 00:15:49,626
Catnip.

350
00:15:50,761 --> 00:15:52,629
(Cats snarling, Bender yelling)

351
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:54,965
(Bender yelling)

352
00:16:00,104 --> 00:16:03,006
You have made yourself an enemy,
my friend!

353
00:16:10,848 --> 00:16:13,817
Dang it. He jumped on the
path train to New Jersey.

354
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:15,318
Of course.

355
00:16:15,352 --> 00:16:17,888
He's commuting back
to his native habitat.

356
00:16:21,526 --> 00:16:23,393
(Panting wearily)

357
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:26,763
(Sighs heavily)

358
00:16:26,797 --> 00:16:28,832
On top of everything,
I'm starving.

359
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:31,601
I'll have to carve a sandwich
out of this tree branch.

360
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,173
Ow! My finger.

361
00:16:37,207 --> 00:16:40,610
I wish I remembered more
survival skills from boy scouts.

362
00:16:40,645 --> 00:16:43,513
Too bad my only merit badge
was in interpretive dance.

363
00:16:43,548 --> 00:16:44,948
(Gasps) Wait.

364
00:16:44,982 --> 00:16:48,518
I can use the universal language
of dance to signal for help.

365
00:16:48,553 --> 00:16:51,988
(Humming)

366
00:16:52,023 --> 00:16:53,322
Ow!

367
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:55,759
That was my second favorite
ankle.

368
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:57,360
(Grunting,
dogs barking in distance)

369
00:16:57,394 --> 00:16:58,662
(Bugle plays)

370
00:16:58,696 --> 00:17:00,530
Was that a horn?

371
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:02,498
Are those the dogs?

372
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:04,868
(Rustling) Is that two
caterpillars making sweet love?

373
00:17:04,902 --> 00:17:06,202
(Fox barks, Bender screams)

374
00:17:06,236 --> 00:17:07,604
(Fox panting)

375
00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:10,674
Aw, you know what it's like
to feel hunted, too, eh, buddy?

376
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,876
Would it be too much
to ask you to stay with me

377
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,645
in my final moments
and die at my side?

378
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,313
And you die first?

379
00:17:17,347 --> 00:17:18,882
(Snarling)

380
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,451
You lousy son of a...!
(Metallic clanking)

381
00:17:21,485 --> 00:17:24,153
Oh, I get it.
You freed me.

382
00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:27,557
(Electrical crackling)
You lousy son of a...!

383
00:17:27,592 --> 00:17:28,992
(Fox panting, Bender grunting)

384
00:17:29,026 --> 00:17:30,827
(Galloping hoof beats)

385
00:17:30,861 --> 00:17:32,929
(Horses neighing, dogs barking)

386
00:17:34,065 --> 00:17:36,032
We're hot on his heels.

387
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:37,533
Aha!

388
00:17:37,568 --> 00:17:38,835
One of his heels.

389
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:41,170
(Ship approaching,
horses neighing

390
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:46,242
oh, these guys.

391
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:47,477
Can I help you?

392
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:49,545
Out of our way,
this fox is ours.

393
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,914
Fox?

394
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:53,416
Ah, yes.
Have at it.

395
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,719
We're not hunting fox today.

396
00:17:55,753 --> 00:17:58,254
Wait a second,
what are you hunting?

397
00:17:58,288 --> 00:17:59,522
(Dogs whimpering)

398
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:00,991
Oh, my God.

399
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:02,592
It's Bender's middle finger.

400
00:18:02,627 --> 00:18:04,427
I'd recognize this anywhere.

401
00:18:04,461 --> 00:18:05,795
(Gasps sharply)

402
00:18:09,466 --> 00:18:11,768
(Snarling, barking)

403
00:18:11,802 --> 00:18:13,402
What is it, little buddy?

404
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:14,704
Is it a layer cake?

405
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:16,606
Or maybe world series tickets?

406
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:19,876
A trip wire, hmm?

407
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,879
But who's tripping who?

408
00:18:22,913 --> 00:18:24,614
(Grunting)

409
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:28,118
(Laughing maniacally)

410
00:18:28,152 --> 00:18:29,953
Wait... whom.

411
00:18:29,987 --> 00:18:31,621
Who's tripping whom?

412
00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:33,556
(Laughing maniacally)

413
00:18:35,092 --> 00:18:36,760
I guess what I've been trying
to say is,

414
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:38,762
we should all be ashamed.

415
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:42,098
Me for my hatred of a mechanical
fox that tore up my sign...

416
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:44,467
and who I'd like to throttle...

417
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:47,303
and you,
for hunting an innocent robot.

418
00:18:47,337 --> 00:18:50,774
Well, a robot who didn't
harm you personally.

419
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:52,142
Today.

420
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:53,476
Probably.

421
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,813
But most of all,
I blame you, huntmaster.

422
00:18:58,448 --> 00:18:59,816
Where's the huntmaster?

423
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,584
Remember when you said
"nobody leave"

424
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:03,486
and then you turned your head
briefly?

425
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,588
He left an hour before that.

426
00:19:14,198 --> 00:19:15,598
(Chuckles deviously)

427
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:18,134
(Grunting)

428
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:20,136
(Yells)

429
00:19:20,171 --> 00:19:22,205
(Grunts)

430
00:19:23,307 --> 00:19:24,841
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

431
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,010
Whoa, whoa,
whoa-whoa-whoa!

432
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:28,511
(Chuckles)

433
00:19:28,545 --> 00:19:30,413
You disappoint me, Bender.

434
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:32,082
I'd've thought you'd
have learned to avoid

435
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:34,350
my antigravity snares by now.

436
00:19:34,384 --> 00:19:35,752
I did.

437
00:19:35,786 --> 00:19:37,453
Too bad you didn't.

438
00:19:37,487 --> 00:19:39,155
Bender:
Boo-oop.

439
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,623
Ye gods!

440
00:19:41,826 --> 00:19:43,193
(Screaming, grunts)

441
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:48,131
How does it feel
to be the hunted?

442
00:19:48,165 --> 00:19:50,299
To be forever looking
over your shoulder,

443
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:52,368
like an owl
with that type of neck?

444
00:19:52,402 --> 00:19:53,703
To die in agony

445
00:19:53,738 --> 00:19:56,439
at the hands of the world's
greatest lover?

446
00:19:56,473 --> 00:19:59,109
(Cocks gun)
No! Please!

447
00:20:02,213 --> 00:20:04,047
I can't shoot you.

448
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:06,883
Bender, I found your
trigger finger.

449
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:08,517
Ah, now I can.

450
00:20:08,552 --> 00:20:09,786
(Cocks gun)

451
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,054
But I won't.

452
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:12,889
Not with so many witnesses.

453
00:20:12,923 --> 00:20:14,557
You're a true gentleman.

454
00:20:14,591 --> 00:20:16,226
Unlike me.

455
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,293
(Gasping)

456
00:20:20,931 --> 00:20:22,398
(Snarling)

457
00:20:22,432 --> 00:20:24,167
(Fox snarling,
huntmaster yelling)

458
00:20:24,201 --> 00:20:26,069
(Gasps):
I can't watch...

459
00:20:26,103 --> 00:20:27,737
Enough.

460
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:30,673
(Snarling) Oh, no!

461
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:31,975
(Screams)

462
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:33,676
Hey, wait a minute.

463
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,746
(Electrical crackling)

464
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:38,381
He was also a robot? Dude!

465
00:20:38,415 --> 00:20:42,085
So a robot fox
killed a robot human?

466
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,853
Eh, I guess that makes it okay.

467
00:20:43,888 --> 00:20:45,155
No.

468
00:20:45,189 --> 00:20:47,023
Killing of any kind is...

469
00:20:47,057 --> 00:20:49,192
I don't know, well...

470
00:20:49,226 --> 00:20:50,860
Let me think about this.
