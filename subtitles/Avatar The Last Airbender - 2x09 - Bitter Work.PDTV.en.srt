00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:14,413
Long ago,the four nations lived together in harmony

6
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:18,741
then everything changed when the firenation attacked

7
00:00:20,037 --> 00:00:23,687
Only the avatar mastered all four elements could stop them

8
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:26,767
but when the world needed him most he vanished

9
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:30,823
100 years passed, my brother and I discovered the new avatar

10
00:00:31,113 --> 00:00:32,836
airbinder named Aang

11
00:00:33,157 --> 00:00:35,336
And although his airbinding skill is great,

12
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:38,122
he has a lot to learn before he is ready to save anyone.

13
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:41,839
but I believe...
...Aang can save the world

Even though I was born blind, I've never had a problem seeing.

17
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,970
I see with earthbending.

18
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:01,910
Look here, sugar queen,  I gave up everything I had so that I could teach Aang earthbending,

19
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,700
Well, look at this. Enemies and traitors all working together.

Chapter nine: Bitter work

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,890
Today's the day!

22
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,160
 Can you believe it? 

23
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,400
After all that time searching for a teacher,

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,580
 I'm finally starting earthbending! 

25
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,960
And this place...i-it's perfect! Don't you think? 

26

Sokka

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,530
 Oh, you're still sleeping, huh? 

28
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,770
Sorry!

29
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,840
Good morning earthbending student! 

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,850
Good morning sifu Toph. 

31
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,730
Hey! You never call me sifu Katara.

32
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,310
Well, if you think I should

33
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,010
Sorry, snoozles. We'll do our earthbending as quietly as we can. 

34
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,040
So what move are you going to teach me first?

35
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,700
 Rockalanche? The trembler? Oh! Maybe I can learn to make a whirlpool out of land! 

36
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,260
Let's start with move a rock. 

37
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,540
Sounds good! Sounds good! 

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,350
The key to earthbending is your stance.

39
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,910
 You've got to be steady and strong. 

40
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,910
Rock is a stubborn element.

41
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,700
If you're going to move it, you've got to be like a rock yourself. 

42
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,810
Like a rock. Got it. 

43
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,490
Good. Now the actual motion of this one is pretty simple.

44
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,300
Okay, you ready to give it a try? 

45
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,630
I'm ready. 

46
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,000
Rock beats airbender! 

47
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,850
 I got you, dad! 

48
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,160
My beloved Lu Ten, I will see you again. 

49
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,830
Uncle! You were unconscious.

50
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,680
Azula did this to you. 

51
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,460
 It was a surprise attack. 

52
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,830
Somehow, that's not so surprising. 

53
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,020
I hope I made it the way you like it. 

54
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,120
Good

55
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,440
That was very, uhh... bracing!

56
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,020
So uncle, I've been thinking.

57
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,370
 It's only a matter of time before I run into Azula again. 

58
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,030
I'm going to need to know more advanced firebending if I want to stand a chance against her.

59
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,510
 I know what you're going to say: she's my sister and I should be trying to get along with her. 

60
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,880
 No, she's crazy and she needs to go down.

61
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,490
 It's time to resume your training. 

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,480
I don't understand what went wrong. He did it exactly the way you did. 

63
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,330
Maybe there's another way.  What if I came at the boulder from a different angle? 

64
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,510
No, that's the problem. 

65
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,720
You've got to stop thinking like an airbender. 

66
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:43,170
There's no different angle, no clever solution, no trickity trick that's going to move that rock.

67
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,380
You've got to face it head on. 

68
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,670
And when I say head on, I mean like this! 

69
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,380
I've been training Aang for a while now.

70
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,080
 He really responds well to a positive teaching experience. 

71
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,890
Lots of encouragement and praise. Kind words. 

72
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,750
If he's doing something wrong, maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction. 

73
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,970
Thanks Katara. A gentle nudge. I'll try that.

74
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,460
Keep your knees high, twinkletoes! 

75
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,200
Rocklike! 

76
00:06:21,637 --> 00:06:22,884
Rocklike!

77
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,840
You're awfully cute, but unfortunately for you, you're made of meat. 

78
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,480
Just a bit closer...

79
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,650
Gotcha! 

80
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,510
 You are one lucky little meat creature. 

81
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,230
Lightning is a pure expression of firebending, 

82
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,290
without aggression.

83
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:10,010
 It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is.

84
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,480
 Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire.

85
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,770
 It is precise and deadly, like Azula.

86
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,500
To perform the technique requires peace of mind. 

87
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,870
I see. That's why we're drinking tea: 

88
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,830
To calm the mind. 

89
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,620
Oh yeah, good point!

90
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,750
 I mean, yes. 

91
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,980
There is energy all around us. The energy is both yin and yang

92
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,090
positive energy and negative energy.

93
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,460
 Only a select few firebenders can separate these energies. 

94
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,210
This creates an imbalance. The energy wants to restore balance ...

95
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,530
and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together.

96
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:59,200
You provide release and guidance, creating lightning. 

97
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,770
 I'm ready to try it! 

98
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,610
 Remember, once you separate the energy, you do not command it. 

99
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,930
You are simply its humble guide. 

100
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,670
Breathe first. 

101
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,750
This time we're going to try something a little different. Instead of moving a rock, 

102
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,140
you're going to stop a rock. 

103
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,450
Get in your horse stance!

104
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,380
I'm going to roll that boulder down at you.

105
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,690
If you have the attitude of an earthbender, you'll stay in your stance and stop the rock. 

106
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,160
Like this

107
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:03,310
Sorry Toph, but are you sure this is really the best way to teach Aang earthbending? 

108
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,320
I'm glad you said something. Actually, there is a better way. 

109
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,790
This way he'll really have to sense the vibrations of the boulder to stop it.

110
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,750
 Thank you Katara. 

111
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,330
 Yeah, thanks Katara! 

112
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,260
I guess I just panicked. I don't know what to say. 

113
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,300
There's nothing to say. 

114
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,900
You blew it. You had a perfect stance and perfect form ...

115
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,460
but when it came right down to it you didn't have the guts. 

116
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,960
I know. I'm sorry. 

117
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,990
Yeah, you are sorry. If you're not tough enough to stop the rock,

118
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:07,240
 then you could at least give it the pleasure of smushing you instead of jumping out of the way like a jelly-boned wimp! 

119
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,370
Now, do you have what it takes to face that rock like an earthbender!? 

120
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,460
No. I don't think I do. 

121
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,300
Aang, it's no big deal. You'll take a break and try earthbending again when you're ready. 

122
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,660
Besides, you still have a lot of waterbending to work on, okay? 

123
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,920
Yeah, that sounds good.

124
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,720
Yeah, whatever, go splash around until you feel better.

125
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,170
Why can't I do it? Instead of lightning, it keeps exploding in my face! 

126
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,150
Like everything always does! 

127
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,780
I was afraid this might happen. 

128
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,840
You will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you. 

129
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,190
What turmoil? 

130
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:58,080
 Zuko, you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away. 

131
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,370
 But I don't feel any shame at all! I'm as proud as ever! 

132
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,620
Prince Zuko, pride is not the object of shame, 

133
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,850
but its source. 

134
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,960
True humility is the only antidote to shame. 

135
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,880
Well,  my life has been nothing but humbling lately. 

136
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,210
I have another idea. 

137
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,530
I will teach you a firebending move that even Azula doesn't know,

138
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,070
 because I made it up myself! 

139
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,580
You probably think I deserve this, don't you? 

140
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,970
 Look, I'm sorry I hunted you, but that's just the natural order of things! 

141
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,950
Big things eat smaller things, nothing personal! 

142
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,670
But this time it didn't work out that way. 

143
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,260
 I admit it. You're cute. 

144
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,560
Okay, you've convinced me. 

145
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,470
If I get out of this alive, it's a comically correct vegetarian existence for me. 

146
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,730
No meat. Even though meat is so tasty. 

147
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,080
It looks like my karma is already paying off! 

148
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,790
That's okay! I got it! 

149
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,120
Now come back boomerang. 

150
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,880
 You know this block you're having is only temporary, right? 

151
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,400
 I don't want to talk about it. 

152
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,370
You do know that's the problem, don't you? 

153
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,110
If you face this issue instead of avoiding it...

154
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,430
I know I know I know I know, I get it, alright! 

155
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,740
 I need to face it head-on, like a rock. 

156
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,800
But I just can't do it! I don't know why I can't, but I can't. 

157
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,020
 Aang, if fire and water are opposites, then what's the opposite of air? 

158
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,550
I guess it's earth. 

159
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,390
That's why it's so hard for you to get this. 

160
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,850
 You're working with your natural opposite. But you'll figure it out. I know you will.

161
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,540
Think fast! 

162
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,550
Excellent.

163
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,710
 You have the reflexes of a waterbending master. 

164
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,670
Thanks Katara. 

165
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,300
Sifu Katara. 

166
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,430
Fire is the element of power. 

167
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:29,790
The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy and drive to achieve what they want. 

168
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,740
Earth is the element of substance. 

169
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:40,630
The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring. 

170
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,250
Air is the element of freedom. 

171
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:50,830
The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom. 

172
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,740
Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor! 

173
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,220
Water is the element of change. 

174
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,990
The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things.

175
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:12,650
They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything. 

176
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,770
Why are you telling me these things? 

177
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,760
It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. 

178
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:25,000
If we take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale.

179
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:30,040
Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations ...

180
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,800
will help you become whole. 

181
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,890
 All this four elements talk is sounding like Avatar stuff. 

182
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:42,440
 It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful. 

183
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,350
But, it can make you more powerful too. 

184
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,820
 You see, the technique I am about to teach you is one I learned by studying the waterbenders. 

185
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,510
Aang! I found these nuts in your bag.

186
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,560
I think you would't mind. And besides,

187
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,580
 even if you did, you're too much of a pushover to do anything about it. 

188
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,510
As a matter of fact, I don't mind. I'm happy to share anything I have.

189
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,920
You know, I'm really glad you feel that way, 

190
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,800
because I also have this great new nutcracker. 

191
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,380
Actually, I'd prefer if you didn't...That's an antique,

192
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,710
 hand crafted by the monks...It's a delicate instrument! 

193
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,420
It's not the only delicate instrument around here. 

194
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,210
Hey Aang, have you seen...

195
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,210
Meditating here! 

196
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,280
It's important. It's almost sundown and Sokka isn't back yet. 

197
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,890
I think we should search for him. 

198
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,400
We'll find him faster if we split up. 

199
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,540
Okay karma person or thing, whoever's in charge of this stuff, 

200
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:04,912
if I can just get out of this situation alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm. OK?

201
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,130
OW! That's all I got! 

202
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,430
It's pretty much my whole identity!

203
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,000
 Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy! 

204
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,900
But I'm willing to be Sokka the veggies and straight talk fellow! 

205
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,830
Deal? 

206
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,170
Aang! Thank goodness! Have you got any meat? 

207
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,060
Sokka! Are you okay? 

208
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,430
 Stop, stop! You're going to pull my fingers off and I don't think the rest of me is coming! 

209
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,390
Hmm... I bet I can airbend you out of here. 

210
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,300
Seriously Aang, I know you're new at it, but I could use a little earthbending here. How about it? 

211
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,520
I can't. 

212
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,950
I can't do it. 

213
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,398
If you can't earthbend me out of here, go get Toph. 

214
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,060
I can't do that either. 

215
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,595
You can't? Why not? 

216
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:04,425
It would just be really...uncomfortable. 

217
00:17:04,425 --> 00:17:07,743
Uncomfortable?Well, I wouldn't want to make you feel uncomfortable. 

218
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,970
Thanks Sokka.

219
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,080
This whole earthbending thing really has me confused. 

220
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,390
There's so much pressure. Everyone expects me to get it right away. 

221
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,160
It puts me in a really awkward position. 

222
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,690
 Awkward position? I think I know the feeling. 

223
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:26,420
If I try, I fail. But if I don't try, I'm never going to get it. 

224
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,783
I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place. 

225
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,350
How about that.

226
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,880
Aang, this is my friend Foo Foo Cuddlypoops. Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang. 

227
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,940
Aww, what a cute name for a little baby sabertooth mooselion cub. 

228
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,080
Really? He looks nothing like a sabertooth mooselion. 

229
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,050
 It's hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in. 

230
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,700
Whatcha doin' out here, little guy? Did you lose your mama? 

231
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,760
Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy. 

232
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,570
A waterbender lets their defense become their offense, 

233
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,620
turning their opponents' energy against them. 

234
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,290
I learned a way to do this with lightning. 

235
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,550
You can teach me to redirect lightning? 

236
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,240
If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it. 

237
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:25,980
You must create a pathway from your fingertips up your arm to your shoulder and down into your stomach. 

238
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,180
The stomach is the source of energy in your body.

239
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,010
 It is called the sea of chi. 

240
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,710
Only in my case, it is more like a vast ocean. 

241
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,530
From the stomach, you direct it up again and out the other arm. 

242
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:50,920
The stomach detour is critical. You must not let the lightning pass through your heart 

243
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,860
... or the damage could be deadly. 

244
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:59,820
You may wish to try a physical motion to get a feel for the pathway's flow. 

245
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,917
Like this. 

246
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:14,700
Now, are you focusing your energy? Can you feel your own chi flowing in, down, up, and out? 

247
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,920
I think so.

248
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,800
Come on. You've got to feel the flow. 

249
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,690
Excellent! You've got it! 

250
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,370
Great! I'm ready to try it with real lightning! 

251
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,360
What, are you crazy?

252
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,120
 Lightning is very dangerous. 

253
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,310
 I thought that was the point: You teaching me how to protect myself from it. 

254
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,980
Yah, But I'm not going to shoot lightning at you! 

255
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:48,960
If you are lucky, you will never have to use this technique at all. 

256
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,290
 Well, if you won't help me, I'll find my own lightning. 

257
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,380
 Hey there? We found your cub!

258
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,220
See? We have no problem with you! We're friendly. 

259
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,580
Aang, this is bad! You gotta get me outta here! 

260
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,470
This is really bad! 

261
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,150
Please, Aang! You have to earthbend me out, there's no other way! 

262
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,140
oh no

263
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,690
Whoo-hoo! Look at me! 

264
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,300
Please don't leave me again. 

265
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,300
I won't. 

266
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,440
What are you doing here? 

267
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,020
Just enjoying the show. 

268
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:20,980
What?  

269
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,020
You were there the whole time?

270
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,270
Pretty much. 

271
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,440
Why didn't you do something? 

272
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,060
Sokka was in trouble!

273
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,200
 I was in trouble! 

274
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,490
You could've gotten him out and helped us get away! 

275
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,250
I guess it just didn't occur to me. 

276
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,590
Enough! I want my staff back! 

277
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,790
 Do it now. 

278
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,750
What? 

279
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,500
Earthbend, twinkletoes. 

280
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,730
You just stood your ground against a crazy beast, 

281
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,750
and even more impressive, you stood your ground against me. 

282
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,713
You've got the stuff. 

283
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:54,300
But...

284
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:54,970
Do it!

285
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,900
You did it! 

286
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,960
You're an earthbender. 

287
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,340
I can't believe it! 

288
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,050
Aww, this is really a wonderful, touching moment. 

289
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,520
So, could you get me out of here so I can give you both a big, snuggly hug? 

290
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,090
No problem, Sokka! 

291
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,900
Actually, you should probably let me do that. You're still a little new to this. 

292
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,390
You might accidentally crush him. 

293
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,320
Yeah, no crushing please. 

294
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,050
You found him! 

295
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,220
The whole time that I was in that hole, not knowing if I would live or die,

296
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,410
 it makes a man think about what's really important.

297
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,600
 I realize...

298
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,210
Hey Katara, look what I can do! 

299
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,800
You did it!

300
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
 I knew you would!

301
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,790
You tried the positive reinforcement, didn't you? 

302
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,030
Yep. It worked wonders. 

303
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,280
 Appa! Appa! I can earthbend now! The key is being completely rooted!

304
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,780
 Physically and mentally unmovable! 

305
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,810
You've always thrown everything you could at me! 

306
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,010
Well I can take it! And now I can give it back!

307
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,190
Come on! Strike me! 

308
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,080
You've never held back before! 

309
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:41,157
