00:00:02,144 --> 00:00:05,144
<b>1x05 - Heir Apparent</b>

2
00:00:07,145 --> 00:00:09,146
<i>Previously on "Green Lantern"...</i>

3
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:12,783
We fight them, we stop
them, whatever it takes.

4
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:15,486
Just how are we gonna
stop who knows how many

5
00:00:15,554 --> 00:00:18,923
superpowerful Red Lanterns
with just the two of us?

6
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:28,165
<i>I'm getting more comfortable
in my human/robotic form every day.</i>

7
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:31,302
<i>I can now assemble
myself in 2.1 seconds.</i>

8
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,337
And up until two days ago,
you weren't much more than

9
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:37,441
a real smart disembodied voice.
Jordan, back me up here.

10
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:42,146
Any girl who can get ready in less
than 3 seconds has my stamp of approval.

11
00:00:42,214 --> 00:00:44,215
<i>Sensors have located
the energy signature</i>

12
00:00:44,283 --> 00:00:49,420
<i>of a Green Lantern power ring
approximately 18.2 teraquads from us.</i>

13
00:00:49,488 --> 00:00:52,556
Great work, Aya.
Plot a course directly to that signal.

14
00:00:52,624 --> 00:00:53,858
We're doing a little recruiting.

15
00:00:53,926 --> 00:00:58,462
Which if successful will bring the total
of your Green Lantern Force to 3.

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,132
Atrocitus will be shaking in his boots.

17
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,533
4 including you.

18
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:05,303
<i>And there would be 5 of
us if you included me.</i>

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,106
Right, and how I could
forget with you constantly bringing it up?

20
00:01:09,174 --> 00:01:11,709
Jordan, you got stuff the
genie back in her box.

21
00:01:11,777 --> 00:01:14,111
You can't let our nav
computer get used to walking

22
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:15,680
around like a real person.

23
00:01:15,747 --> 00:01:19,750
<i>You may be unaware that
I can hear every sound on this vessel.</i>

24
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:22,153
Aya, I appreciate
the enthusiasm, but I think

25
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,921
It's best if you stay with the ship.

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,702
<i>Our queen and sovereign.</i>

27
00:01:42,207 --> 00:01:45,643
- Great timing as usual, Hal.
- It's a gift.

28
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:48,512
Hold. Observe their
garb and manner.

29
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,249
They are Green Lanterns
and friends.

30
00:01:52,317 --> 00:01:56,721
I am Queen Iolande.
I welcome you to Betrassus.

31
00:01:56,788 --> 00:01:58,289
Dulac used to tell
me stories of other

32
00:01:58,357 --> 00:01:59,790
Green Lanterns,
but I thought they

33
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:01,692
were nothing but tall tales.

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,261
This is my brother Prince Ragnar.

35
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:07,631
Iolande, your name
sounds like a waterfall.

36
00:02:10,702 --> 00:02:13,771
Worst line ever.

37
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:16,774
We're looking for the
Green Lantern that serves your planet.

38
00:02:16,842 --> 00:02:18,209
Green Lantern Dulac.

39
00:02:18,276 --> 00:02:21,212
He has protected
Betrassus for many years.

40
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:24,281
We need his help to fight a
deadly threat on the frontier.

41
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:26,250
You speak of the Red Lanterns.

42
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:28,552
Several of our off-planet
outposts have been attacked

43
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,187
by these vicious marauders.

44
00:02:30,255 --> 00:02:32,256
You're probably the only
ones strong enough to fight

45
00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:33,858
off the Red Lanterns.

46
00:02:33,925 --> 00:02:35,226
Enough!

47
00:02:35,293 --> 00:02:37,428
Betrassus doesn't
need Green Lanterns.

48
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:41,198
We need a king to command its
army, and that will be me!

49
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:44,702
Kothak, once again you
overstep your bounds.

50
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,370
It is our custom.

51
00:02:46,438 --> 00:02:49,407
If the queen is coroneted
without a husband, then the

52
00:02:49,474 --> 00:02:52,510
greatest warrior may claim
her hand and share the throne.

53
00:02:52,577 --> 00:02:54,211
Face it, princess.

54
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:57,515
You don't have what it takes
to rule this kingdom alone.

55
00:02:57,582 --> 00:03:01,619
Will no one challenge
Kothak for my sister's hand?

56
00:03:01,686 --> 00:03:06,424
<i>I will challenge Kothak
for the hand of Iolande.</i>

57
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:08,626
I think we found our man.

58
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,701
I've seen the destruction caused
by the Red Lanterns with my own eyes.

59
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:20,805
I would be proud to join
your fight against them.

60
00:03:20,872 --> 00:03:22,840
It will mean leaving the queen.

61
00:03:22,908 --> 00:03:26,911
Iolande has no love for
a tired old warhorse like me.

62
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:30,347
I'll marry her to keep her
throne save from Kothak.

63
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:33,217
He is not to be trusted,
but once I win her hand,

64
00:03:33,285 --> 00:03:37,621
I can best protect her and our
world by joining your crusade.

65
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:40,925
It's pretty easy to see why
you were chosen by your ring.

66
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:42,793
Happy to have you aboard.

67
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,434
I still can't believe you're here,
another actual Green Lantern.

68
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:52,336
I am sir Dulac's greatest
supporter, and now I'm

69
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:54,939
here to offer you equal devotion.

70
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:58,275
Excuse me for overhearing, but
you said the ring chose you to

71
00:03:58,343 --> 00:03:59,877
be a Green Lantern.

72
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:02,446
Were there many tests of
your strength and bravery?

73
00:04:02,514 --> 00:04:04,982
No. I was nearby when the
Green Lantern in my sector

74
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,418
died, and his ring came to me.

75
00:04:07,486 --> 00:04:10,254
Anyone can seem like
a warrior when wearing the most

76
00:04:10,322 --> 00:04:11,989
powerful weapon on the planet.

77
00:04:12,057 --> 00:04:13,858
The terms of the challenge
state that we face

78
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:15,526
each other equally armed.

79
00:04:15,594 --> 00:04:18,996
Then you'll see I'm more
a hero than Dulac will ever be.

80
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:20,965
We shall see.

81
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:25,703
He ought to be on a leash.

82
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,273
I will put a stop to
Kothak's scheming tomorrow.

83
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:32,009
Then you shall have my aid.

84
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:34,245
[cheering]

85
00:04:48,093 --> 00:04:49,960
<i>Boo!</i>

86
00:04:53,532 --> 00:04:55,299
[indistinct chatter]

87
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:58,302
Hmm.

88
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,572
Milady, sir Dulac cannot be found.

89
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,309
[crowd gasping and murmuring]

90
00:05:05,377 --> 00:05:08,479
Clearly your precious
green knight has fled.

91
00:05:08,547 --> 00:05:10,014
That doesn't make any sense.

92
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:13,684
Name one Green Lantern you've ever
known to run away from a fight.

93
00:05:13,752 --> 00:05:20,057
So Dulac forfeits the challenge.
Iolande is mine.

94
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:23,694
We saw yesterday that there
is no one else on Betrassus brave

95
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:25,829
enough to face me.

96
00:05:25,897 --> 00:05:28,732
No, but the is
one brave enough now.

97
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,601
Here we go.

98
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:33,537
I will fight for
the hand of Iolande.

99
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:35,072
[cheering]

100
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:41,119
<i>I will not allow it?</i>

101
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:44,923
This Green Lantern is an outsider
with no royal blood whatsoever.

102
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,659
If you win, you're gonna
have to stay here and rule.

103
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:51,362
We've got an agenda,
an intergalactic menace to destroy.

104
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,997
Don't get your
regulation undies in a bunch.

105
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:56,768
I'll defeat Kothak, then release
Iolande to rule in her own right.

106
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:59,737
Everybody wins, happily
ever after, boo-yah.

107
00:05:59,805 --> 00:06:01,739
Does he understand the
challenge must be fought

108
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:03,875
without his precious power ring?

109
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:06,878
He does.
He's also right here in the room,

110
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:09,047
so you don't have to talk
about him in the third person,

111
00:06:09,114 --> 00:06:12,016
and he looks forward
to kicking your butt tomorrow.

112
00:06:12,084 --> 00:06:14,085
Err.

113
00:06:14,153 --> 00:06:15,920
<i>The ship is primed
and ready to leave.</i>

114
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:18,289
<i>Why aren't you back here
with the Lantern we tracked?</i>

115
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:19,858
He's gone missing.

116
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:21,392
<i>I can easily find him.</i>

117
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,863
No. You can't just go running
around in that Red Lantern getup.

118
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,165
We've got enough on our hands
without you starting a panic.

119
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:29,300
<i>My talents are
wasted waiting here.</i>

120
00:06:29,368 --> 00:06:30,869
Stay with Aya.

121
00:06:30,936 --> 00:06:34,272
Have her run a scan
for Dulac's power ring.

122
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,774
<i>Sensors have located
a weak energy trail.</i>

123
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:40,044
<i>It is possible that it is
Green Lantern Dulac's ring.</i>

124
00:06:40,112 --> 00:06:41,980
<i>The energy trail is too
distant to make that</i>

125
00:06:42,047 --> 00:06:43,982
<i>determination with
total confidence.</i>

126
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:46,150
So you're saying we
need to be closer.

127
00:06:46,218 --> 00:06:49,954
<i>It would aid me, but
our orders are to remain on the ship.</i>

128
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:51,723
I was ordered to help you
trace the power ring, which is

129
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:56,895
exactly what we'll be doing if you
put yourself together and go with me.

130
00:06:56,962 --> 00:07:00,832
<i>Only 2.1 seconds to assemble.</i>

131
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,201
<i>Are my components
properly aligned?</i>

132
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:05,770
You look fine.

133
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:08,139
<i>You also look fine.</i>

134
00:07:19,852 --> 00:07:24,289
You'll need practice.
Kothak is very skilled on his machine.

135
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:25,757
I could help you.

136
00:07:25,824 --> 00:07:29,193
Back on my home planet,
I'm a test pilot for supersonic aircraft.

137
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:32,764
I don't think this little sidewalk skimmer
will give me any problems.

138
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:36,100
In fact, I'll probably invent a few
new moves while I'm feeling it out.

139
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:40,438
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, ohh!

140
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:42,740
Unh!

141
00:07:42,808 --> 00:07:45,243
You're right.
That was new.

142
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:09,601
For future reference, when
in my physical form, I prefer

143
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:12,036
not to be pushed into the dirt.

144
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,250
Whoa!
Nnunh!

145
00:08:26,318 --> 00:08:29,187
Some hero.

146
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:34,959
I look forward to destroying you
in the tournament tomorrow.

147
00:08:35,027 --> 00:08:39,831
You know, I think I'll
gratefully accept a couple of pointers.

148
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:42,300
Well, come along then.

149
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:46,904
If you can keep up, that is.

150
00:08:46,972 --> 00:08:50,842
She fell for the waterfall line.
Unbelievable.

151
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:53,311
I thought you might be thirsty.

152
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:58,082
I like a little more slime
floating on top, but thanks, kid.

153
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,918
Have I told you what an
honor it is to have you here?

154
00:09:00,986 --> 00:09:03,221
Over and over.

155
00:09:03,288 --> 00:09:07,458
My beloved kingdom is under
threat and not just by the Red Lanterns.

156
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:09,961
There's an internal threat,
as well, so having two

157
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:12,363
Green Lanterns here
is a great comfort.

158
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:15,566
3 lanterns counting Dulac,
soon as we track him down.

159
00:09:15,634 --> 00:09:19,070
Heck, 4 if you count Aya.
Heh. She'd love that.

160
00:09:28,714 --> 00:09:30,048
Ha ha ha!

161
00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:31,783
[motor sputters]

162
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:48,466
I had no idea these
machines were so unstable.

163
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:50,301
They aren't.

164
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:52,236
You think someone
did this deliberately?

165
00:09:52,304 --> 00:09:54,238
Kothak is capable of anything.

166
00:09:54,306 --> 00:09:56,641
This situation is
getting far too dangerous.

167
00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:00,178
I want you to back out of
the challenge, for your own protection.

168
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:01,879
Back out? Not on your life.

169
00:10:01,947 --> 00:10:04,382
This just got interesting for me.

170
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,050
You are brave.

171
00:10:06,118 --> 00:10:09,120
I don't know if fighting for
my throne is even worth it.

172
00:10:09,188 --> 00:10:13,124
A queen must be wise, strong,
clever, and a million other

173
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:16,527
things that I don't know if
I am or will ever be.

174
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:20,665
You're all of those
things and so much more.

175
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:22,834
How can you be so sure?

176
00:10:22,901 --> 00:10:26,138
I'm a pretty good judge of character.

177
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:29,440
My sensors indicate the
energy signal is getting

178
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:33,678
stronger, but it seems
our search is over.

179
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:35,646
Not quite.

180
00:10:47,426 --> 00:10:49,261
Dulac.

181
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:53,531
There doesn't seem to be any
signs indicating a struggle.

182
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:57,635
So he didn't go down fighting.
Odd.

183
00:10:57,703 --> 00:11:00,905
His ring is gone.
Has it gone back to Oa?

184
00:11:00,973 --> 00:11:03,074
The interceptor's sensors
would have noted that.

185
00:11:03,142 --> 00:11:06,077
The signal is still near here.

186
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:08,546
It's time we notify the others.

187
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:14,519
Great job obeying orders.

188
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:16,220
Do I need to write
them down from now on?

189
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:17,655
A warrior acts.

190
00:11:17,723 --> 00:11:20,091
A warrior listens to his superiors.

191
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,194
Enough. I'll give them the
insubordination lecture later.

192
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:24,462
What have you found?

193
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,197
We found his body in the catacombs.

194
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:28,900
We're still trying to
locate his power ring.

195
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:31,435
If it hasn't chosen
a new bearer already.

196
00:11:31,503 --> 00:11:35,239
My sensors indicate that the ring
is somewhere within the castle walls.

197
00:11:35,307 --> 00:11:37,441
My gut instinct tells me
so is the killer.

198
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:40,978
Then we must find this
murderer and bring him to justice.

199
00:11:41,046 --> 00:11:42,513
It is what Green Lanterns do.

200
00:11:42,581 --> 00:11:46,484
We will, but we have to do it carefully.
We'll need proof.

201
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:47,552
You go back to the ship.

202
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:49,153
We'll call if we need backup,

203
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:50,988
but we might have to make
a quick exit.

204
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:54,259
Kilowog and I have a trap to set.

205
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:57,495
[crowd cheering]

206
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:20,384
And here, another flagon of that ale
you so enjoyed before.

207
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:23,354
Hey!
You remembered the slime!

208
00:12:23,622 --> 00:12:28,659
Iolande, prepare to wed
as soon as I defeat this peasant.

209
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:32,096
Know your place, Kothak.

210
00:12:32,164 --> 00:12:35,233
Queen Iolande, I fight so
that your people might have

211
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,236
the capable, honest ruler they deserve.

212
00:13:10,235 --> 00:13:13,004
Keep your chin up, Jordan!
Focus!

213
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,580
[cheering]

214
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:57,615
Come on, Jordan!

215
00:13:57,683 --> 00:13:59,984
[coughing]

216
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:05,790
[choking]

217
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:07,425
Aah!

218
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:18,035
Ohh! Poison!
He's been murdered!

219
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,466
Kilowog! Come on, buddy.

220
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,269
Speak to me! Please.

221
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:35,074
Hal, he's gone.

222
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:38,444
No!
Whoever did this will pay.

223
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:42,114
The death of the outsider
is inconsequential.

224
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:45,985
I demand my challenger return
to the field so I may defeat

225
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:50,356
him and become the
rightful king of Betrassus.

226
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:52,959
Look! The ring!

227
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,894
[gasping]

228
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,676
Finally. It's mine!
The power I've dreamed of!

229
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,145
Again, I protest this delay.

230
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,948
Your silly contest no
longer matters, Kothak.

231
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:18,584
What matters is that I'm
a Green Lantern, the most

232
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:22,922
powerful citizen of Betrassus.
I shall be your ruler.

233
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,259
Bow down and grovel to me,
your new king!

234
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:29,395
You did this!
You murdered my friend!

235
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:32,932
I had to. You told me that
when a Lantern dies

236
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,268
his ring searches for the next
worthy person.

237
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:38,537
Knowing myself to be most
worthy, I killed Dulac so

238
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,072
that his ring might come to me.

239
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,174
[booing]

240
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:43,943
Do not judge me!

241
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:45,945
I loved Dulac more than any of you.

242
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:49,715
That's why I killed him,
to honor him by being his successor.

243
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,817
And Kilowog?
Why him?

244
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:55,121
Dulac's ring didn't come
to me, so I had to try again.

245
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,522
I had to!

246
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,458
Sorry, but I can't let
you get away with this.

247
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:02,862
You don't have a choice,
none of you!

248
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:10,202
Unh!

249
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,537
What happened to my ring?

250
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:14,240
Where is it?
I want my ring!

251
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:16,676
I still have it.

252
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:21,614
The ring you thought chose you was
a construct I made while playing dead.

253
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:25,017
Bravo, Kilowog.
Excellent performance.

254
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:27,019
Heh.
Aw, gee. Thanks.

255
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:29,188
I thought maybe slobbering
the grog all over a was a bit

256
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:32,491
much, but I sure has heck
wasn't gonna drink any.

257
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,695
Oh, Ragnar, I am heartbroken.

258
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:40,232
This is my planet.
I was born to lead!

259
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,468
I'll show you all!

260
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:43,736
My queen!

261
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:45,338
Your reign is over, sister.

262
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:49,543
Look at how easily I paid
off your guards.

263
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:55,181
If I cannot rule Betrassus,
then neither will you.

264
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:58,319
Attack now!

265
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:02,221
Kilowog, my ring.

266
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,327
Aah!

267
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,312
Aah!

268
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,018
[groaning]

269
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,004
[groaning]

270
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:13,092
Give it up, Ragnar!
Don't be a fool!

271
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:29,809
Close the gates!

272
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:39,318
- Unh!
- Unh!

273
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:40,853
[moans]

274
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:43,622
Stay back!

275
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,991
Let me go, or I'll kill her.

276
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,964
Iolande, put the ring on now!

277
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:07,980
Aaaaugh!

278
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,087
Please!
I beg for quarter.

279
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:25,764
The true enemy is defeated.

280
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,934
We thank our lantern friends
for bringing him to justice.

281
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:35,107
Guards, round up the traitors
and take my brother to the tower.

282
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,375
You'll all be sorry.

283
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:42,248
I will be a Lantern, and then you'll pay!
You'll all pay!

284
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:48,254
You will be... nay.
You are a great leader.

285
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:54,460
You are my queen and sovereign,
and to you I offer all my loyalty.

286
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:57,963
Better late than never.

287
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,699
<i>Our queen and sovereign!</i>

288
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,372
<i>Did you know all along
Ragnar had killed Dulac?</i>

289
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:10,242
No, but he was a little too curious
about how you become a Green Lantern.

290
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,645
Then Kilowog remembered that
Ragnar was happy to have

291
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,580
two Green Lanterns on Betrassus.

292
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:18,651
Only someone who knew Dulac was dead
wouldn't include him in the count.

293
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,786
But how did you know
I had the ring?

294
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:24,123
Once I found out Dulac was dead,
I knew his ring would go

295
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:29,862
to the most worthy person, and like I said,
I'm a pretty good judge of character.

296
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,830
Thank you for everything.

297
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,433
Now that you're a Green
Lantern, will you join us in our

298
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:36,335
fight against the Red Lanterns?

299
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:39,371
I would love nothing more
than to go with you, but I'm

300
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,174
more than
a Green Lantern to my people.

301
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:47,346
- You're their queen.
- Yes, and duty to them comes first.

302
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:50,249
Unfortunately my
birthright is not a choice.

303
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:53,586
In fact, there are very few
things I can choose,

304
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:55,220
but this is one of them.

305
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:00,926
Good-bye, Hal Jordan.
