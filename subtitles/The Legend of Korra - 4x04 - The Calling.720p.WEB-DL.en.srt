1
00:00:07,813 --> 00:00:09,213
Earth.

2
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:10,748
Fire.

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,516
Air.

4
00:00:12,518 --> 00:00:13,818
Water.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,055
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements

6
00:00:18,057 --> 00:00:21,259
and bring balance to the world.

7

8
00:00:27,096 --> 00:00:29,263
After three years, Kuvira has united

9
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:30,505
the former earth kingdom states

10
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:32,734
under her new earth empire banner.

11
00:00:32,736 --> 00:00:34,836
But one holdout remains: Zaofu.

12
00:00:34,838 --> 00:00:35,838
During that same time,

13
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:37,839
Asami rebuilt the
company her father created

14
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:39,907
and helped redesign the
city's infrastructure.

15
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:42,410
And most recently, the
airbender kids found the Avatar.

16
00:00:42,412 --> 00:00:45,380
Korra rid herself of the
residual poison in her body

17
00:00:45,382 --> 00:00:48,716
and is ready to return to action.

18
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:12,707
We have an emergency.

19
00:01:16,445 --> 00:01:18,112
I'll contact President Raiko.

20
00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:21,249
He'll send the united forces.

21
00:01:22,384 --> 00:01:25,420
Call whomever you want, but
they'll never make it in time.

22
00:01:25,422 --> 00:01:30,391
Kuvira's already here, and
she brought her entire army.

23
00:01:40,903 --> 00:01:41,869
By this time tomorrow,

24
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:43,351
my mother will have signed our treaty,

25
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,174
and the earth empire
will finally be united.

26
00:01:46,176 --> 00:01:47,408
Don't get ahead of yourself.

27
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,345
Securing your hometown won't
be like every other city.

28
00:01:51,347 --> 00:01:55,049
Zaofu stopped being my home long ago.

29
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:57,385
I'm ready to take it by force.

30
00:01:57,387 --> 00:01:58,119
No.

31
00:01:58,121 --> 00:02:00,288
The eyes of the world are on us now.

32
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,356
We must do this right.

33
00:02:02,358 --> 00:02:03,458
That's why we need Bolin.

34
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,961
Do you really think we can rely on him?

35
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:08,396
Su trusts him.

36
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:10,231
She'll listen to him.

37
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:13,468
Are you sure we should be going to Zaofu?

38
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,237
Dad wanted us to bring
you back to Republic City.

39
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,973
If Kuvira's heading to Zaofu, so am I.

40
00:02:18,975 --> 00:02:21,776
She needs to know that the Avatar is back.

41
00:02:21,778 --> 00:02:23,211
The world needs to know.

42
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:24,846
Whoo-hoo!

43
00:02:24,848 --> 00:02:26,147
Avatar fight!

44
00:02:26,149 --> 00:02:29,016
This is going to be awesome!

45
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:31,452
Meelo, there's not gonna be a fight.

46
00:02:31,454 --> 00:02:32,887
Kuvira saved my dad.

47
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:34,169
She was a Captain in Su's guard.

48
00:02:34,193 --> 00:02:36,190
I think she can be reasoned with.

49
00:02:36,192 --> 00:02:37,925
What? No fight?

50
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:41,028
Why did we go through all
that trouble to save you

51
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,233
if you're not going to beat someone up?

52
00:02:48,237 --> 00:02:50,471
Zhu Li, is this thing on?

53
00:02:50,473 --> 00:02:51,672
We're rolling, sir.

54
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:54,976
Okay, I'm Varrick of Varrick
industries international,

55
00:02:54,978 --> 00:02:59,280
and this is spirit vine experiment 3-02

56
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:01,415
hand me the thing.

57
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,956
In this stasis capsule is a
preserved spirit vine sample

58
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:13,127
weighing approximately two Zhu Lis.

59
00:03:13,462 --> 00:03:16,597
I have postulated that these spirit vines

60
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:19,267
are a form of pure energy that's unstable

61
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:22,069
in what we call "typical earth conditions."

62
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:25,139
This machine should transfer
the energy from the vine

63
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:28,142
into a battery using electrical currents,

64
00:03:28,144 --> 00:03:29,410
reverse magnetic polarity,

65
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:35,950
and a little-known phenomenon
I call the Varri-effect.

66
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,153
It's working.

67
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:42,390
It's registering five Varricks of power...

68
00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:47,028
Now seven Varricks.

69
00:03:47,696 --> 00:03:51,065
Whoa. What is this?

70
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:54,035
What's going on?

71
00:03:54,037 --> 00:03:55,303
Oh!

72
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:56,237
Ahh!

73
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,072
Zhu Li, shut it down.

74
00:03:58,074 --> 00:04:00,541
There are too many Varricks.

75
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:12,053
Ahh!

76
00:04:12,055 --> 00:04:14,555
Ahh!

77
00:04:14,557 --> 00:04:17,325
Sir...

78
00:04:19,462 --> 00:04:20,361
You're too heavy.

79
00:04:20,363 --> 00:04:24,031
You know, you could stand
to lose a few Zhu Lis.

80
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:26,067
I think you're just weak, sir.

81
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:27,602
Pull harder.

82
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:33,341
Ahh!

83
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:38,045
Varrick, you saved me.

84
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:39,480
Of course I saved you.

85
00:04:39,482 --> 00:04:42,984
I can't clean this place up by myself.

86
00:04:42,986 --> 00:04:43,684
Grab a broom.

87
00:04:43,686 --> 00:04:45,653
What happened? Were we attacked?

88
00:04:45,655 --> 00:04:49,357
No, we were spirit-vined, but don't worry.

89
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:52,259
I'm putting the kibosh on this project.

90
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:53,094
No, you're not.

91
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:56,297
Do you realize what we can
do with this kind of power?

92
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:57,299
Yes, I do.

93
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,200
And that's why we've
got to put an end to it.

94
00:04:59,202 --> 00:05:00,935
What if it fell into the wrong hands?

95
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:03,237
Since when does that matter to you?

96
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:04,639
I know. It's not like me, right?

97
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:06,161
Usually, I look at a project like this,

98
00:05:06,185 --> 00:05:09,610
and all I think is, "wow, I can
make a ton of money off this."

99
00:05:09,612 --> 00:05:14,649
But recently, I've been having
these strange feelings inside.

100
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:17,752
It's like I'm... concerned with others.

101
00:05:17,754 --> 00:05:20,154
And there's this nagging voice in my head

102
00:05:20,156 --> 00:05:23,357
constantly telling me
what's right from wrong.

103
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:26,260
I believe that voice
is your conscience, sir.

104
00:05:26,262 --> 00:05:27,862
Well, I'm the other voice in your head,

105
00:05:27,886 --> 00:05:31,599
and I'm telling you, you
will continue this project.

106
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:32,400
Sorry, no.

107
00:05:32,402 --> 00:05:34,195
I just really got to stand
my ground on this one.

108
00:05:34,322 --> 00:05:35,054
Whoa!

109
00:05:35,056 --> 00:05:37,223
Now there's a voice in my head telling me

110
00:05:37,225 --> 00:05:38,924
to drop you on the tracks.

111
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:41,160
Should I listen?

112
00:05:41,162 --> 00:05:42,028
No, no.

113
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,897
Head voices are liars.
What do head voices know?

114
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:46,198
I'll work on the project.

115
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,801
Please don't drop me.

116
00:05:48,803 --> 00:05:52,004
Ahh!

117
00:06:05,052 --> 00:06:07,887
Asami, you came.

118
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:13,859
I'm here to return these.

119
00:06:13,861 --> 00:06:15,661
You never opened them.

120
00:06:15,663 --> 00:06:16,729
Stop writing me.

121
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:20,866
I never want to see or hear from you again.

122
00:06:20,868 --> 00:06:22,268
Please, just let me say one thing,

123
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:25,304
then I'll never contact you again.

124
00:06:25,306 --> 00:06:29,742
I can't forgive myself for all
the horrible things I've done,

125
00:06:29,744 --> 00:06:31,711
and I never expect you to forgive me.

126
00:06:31,713 --> 00:06:35,815
I tore our family apart
and destroyed our good name.

127
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:36,849
But in a life of regret,

128
00:06:36,851 --> 00:06:42,655
you're the one thing I look
back on that makes me smile.

129
00:06:42,923 --> 00:06:46,892
I just want you to know
I'm so proud of you, Asami.

130
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:52,598
You are the greatest thing I ever created.

131
00:07:02,876 --> 00:07:04,276
Am I in trouble?

132
00:07:04,278 --> 00:07:07,079
No. In fact, I have good news.

133
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:10,282
We want you to be part of our inner circle.

134
00:07:10,284 --> 00:07:12,318
Inner circle! No way! Yes!

135
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,021
Ahem, that is a great honor.

136
00:07:16,023 --> 00:07:17,156
What does it mean, exactly?

137
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:19,058
It means you've proven your worth.

138
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,127
We're so close to uniting the empire,

139
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:24,163
but Su has some resentment
towards me and Baatar

140
00:07:24,165 --> 00:07:25,464
that might cloud her judgment

141
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:28,234
and stop her from making a wise decision.

142
00:07:28,236 --> 00:07:30,903
We believe you can help her see clearly.

143
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:32,004
I can do that.

144
00:07:32,006 --> 00:07:33,406
By the time I'm finished telling her

145
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,275
all the great things we've
done, she'll be begging to join.

146
00:07:36,277 --> 00:07:38,844
Good, because we're here.

147
00:07:40,347 --> 00:07:43,315
Aren't all these troops
gonna send the wrong message?

148
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:45,551
The army is here to project strength.

149
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:48,954
You're here to present peace.

150
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,167
Opal, you're here too.

151
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:03,636
No, you've chosen your side.

152
00:08:03,638 --> 00:08:06,005
Sides? There shouldn't be sides.

153
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:09,041
I know, why don't we all
stand in a circle, huh,

154
00:08:09,043 --> 00:08:10,075
maybe hold hands?

155
00:08:10,077 --> 00:08:11,210
I'm not giving up Zaofu.

156
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:13,579
I don't care if you
brought your entire army.

157
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:16,282
Su, I didn't bring my army to threaten you.

158
00:08:16,284 --> 00:08:18,484
I wanted to show you
all that your son and I

159
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:19,518
have accomplished.

160
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,020
You must realize what you're doing

161
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:24,757
goes against everything your
father and I tried to teach you.

162
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:27,259
Son, you belong here.

163
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:27,893
Why?

164
00:08:27,895 --> 00:08:30,563
So that I can go on living in your shadow?

165
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:31,964
Don't say that.

166
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:34,166
Can't you see she's brainwashed you.

167
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:36,969
Ha, I didn't brainwash him.

168
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:38,003
I set him free.

169
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:39,505
And now he's accomplished more with me

170
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:40,973
than he ever could have with you.

171
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:45,211
Okay, guys, obviously,
there's a lot of personal,

172
00:08:45,213 --> 00:08:46,178
painful history here.

173
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,148
So what do say we just all
forget about that stuff, huh?

174
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,516
I mean, that's the past.

175
00:08:50,518 --> 00:08:51,951
Right, Wing? Right, Wei?

176
00:08:51,953 --> 00:08:54,153
You guys know what I'm talking about.

177
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:56,722
High five.

178
00:08:56,724 --> 00:08:58,424
All right. No, it's cool.

179
00:08:58,426 --> 00:09:00,259
You know what I think we need to do?

180
00:09:00,261 --> 00:09:01,427
Focus on the future.

181
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:03,462
And the future is bright. Let me tell you.

182
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:06,131
I've seen it. Yeah, saw it last month.

183
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:08,300
We went to this town that had nothing.

184
00:09:08,302 --> 00:09:10,503
Most of the people
there had never even seen

185
00:09:10,505 --> 00:09:11,904
a satomobile before.

186
00:09:11,906 --> 00:09:15,140
But now they have two satomobiles,

187
00:09:15,142 --> 00:09:17,009
running water, and a magnet train

188
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:18,544
that goes right through their town.

189
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:20,246
I mean, how awesome is that?

190
00:09:20,248 --> 00:09:22,648
They might have been happy
when you first arrived,

191
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,483
but I've seen what happens after you leave.

192
00:09:24,485 --> 00:09:27,319
Citizens are forced to work as slave labor.

193
00:09:27,321 --> 00:09:29,955
Dissenters are sent off to who knows where.

194
00:09:29,957 --> 00:09:31,090
You're wrong, Opal.

195
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,958
Now, I don't know what
you think you've seen,

196
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,294
but I'm giving you the 100% Bolin guarantee

197
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:36,962
that we're making the earth empire

198
00:09:36,964 --> 00:09:38,063
a better place to live.

199
00:09:38,065 --> 00:09:41,100
I can't believe you brought Bolin here

200
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:43,102
to try to sway us.

201
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:43,602
Leave.

202
00:09:43,604 --> 00:09:46,405
Zaofu will never accept
you as their leader.

203
00:09:46,407 --> 00:09:47,940
Then you leave me no choice.

204
00:09:47,942 --> 00:09:51,410
You have 24 hours to
agree to join the empire,

205
00:09:51,412 --> 00:09:54,980
or we take the city by force.

206
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:03,989
I see it. Zaofu.

207
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:05,391
We made it.

208
00:10:05,393 --> 00:10:11,030
And a bunch of other people are here too.

209
00:10:11,032 --> 00:10:12,064
Oh, no.

210
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:14,500
I hope we're not too late.

211
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,137
Korra?

212
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:20,539
I can't believe it. Where have you been?

213
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,008
You disappeared. Everyone was so worried.

214
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,710
I'll tell you the whole story later.

215
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:28,080
Right now, I want to help you stop Kuvira.

216
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:30,349
What can I do?

217
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:31,631
You were just bluffing, right?

218
00:10:31,655 --> 00:10:34,486
I mean, you're not really going
to attack Zaofu... Are you?

219
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:37,723
When people don't cooperate,
we must find other ways

220
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:39,525
of convincing them to join.

221
00:10:39,527 --> 00:10:40,726
Other ways?

222
00:10:40,728 --> 00:10:43,662
How many times have we
used these other ways

223
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:44,496
in the past?

224
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:46,365
It's not for you to worry about.

225
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:48,500
So... What does happen

226
00:10:48,502 --> 00:10:51,403
to all of those towns and
villages after we leave?

227
00:10:51,405 --> 00:10:54,406
I just realized I've never really gone back

228
00:10:54,408 --> 00:10:55,441
and checked on them.

229
00:10:55,443 --> 00:10:57,376
Those people are my loyal subjects,

230
00:10:57,378 --> 00:11:00,579
and they contribute to the
empire however I see fit.

231
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:02,214
Now that you're in the inner circle,

232
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:04,550
you're going to have to
accept some hard truths.

233
00:11:04,552 --> 00:11:08,454
Maybe I'm not really an
inner-circle kind of guy.

234
00:11:08,456 --> 00:11:11,323
Or... or maybe we don't take over Zaofu.

235
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:12,958
We could just let them be on their own,

236
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,727
then yay, the empire's united.

237
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:16,228
Congratulations to us.

238
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,497
I didn't know your
personal feelings for Opal

239
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:21,266
were stronger than your loyalty to me.

240
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:23,235
Zaofu will join us.

241
00:11:23,237 --> 00:11:25,137
The only thing I'm second-guessing

242
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:26,705
is the decision to bring you along.

243
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:30,676
Maybe you need to spend some
time in a reeducation camp.

244
00:11:30,678 --> 00:11:33,245
I thought that's where we send people

245
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,280
to learn new trade skills.

246
00:11:35,282 --> 00:11:37,149
Hard truths, Bolin.

247
00:11:37,151 --> 00:11:39,952
Your loyalty seems to be wavering.

248
00:11:39,954 --> 00:11:43,789
No, no, I'm totally on your side,

249
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:47,993
completely 100% loyal.

250
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:54,400
How did things get so bad
between you and Kuvira?

251
00:11:54,402 --> 00:11:56,168
I thought she was your protege?

252
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,703
She was more than that.

253
00:11:57,705 --> 00:11:59,204
She was like a daughter to me.

254
00:11:59,206 --> 00:12:01,640
I took her in when she was eight years old

255
00:12:01,642 --> 00:12:02,875
and nourished her talents.

256
00:12:02,877 --> 00:12:05,744
Kuvira was smart, a natural leader,

257
00:12:05,746 --> 00:12:08,313
and quickly rose through the ranks.

258
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:10,449
I saw myself in her.

259
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:11,583
What happened?

260
00:12:11,585 --> 00:12:15,154
Three years ago, after the
fall of the earth queen,

261
00:12:15,156 --> 00:12:18,557
Raiko and Tenzin came to see me.

262
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
The earth kingdom is in chaos.

263
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:22,361
There's a vacuum of power,
and I'm concerned about

264
00:12:22,363 --> 00:12:25,264
what will happen if
someone doesn't take control

265
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,098
of the situation.

266
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,633
And do you think I should be the one?

267
00:12:27,635 --> 00:12:29,902
You're the perfect person to take charge.

268
00:12:29,904 --> 00:12:32,538
The world leaders trust
you, and as a Beifong,

269
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,540
you have credibility in the earth kingdom.

270
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:36,241
I'm honored that you thought of me,

271
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:39,278
but I'm not interested
in imposing my ideals

272
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,946
on an entire nation.

273
00:12:40,948 --> 00:12:42,715
I'm afraid I can't help you.

274
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:45,317
Suyin, I know this isn't my place,

275
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:46,819
but I think you should do this.

276
00:12:46,821 --> 00:12:49,221
Zaofu has always been a
beacon of modern progress,

277
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:51,724
and now you can share that with everyone.

278
00:12:51,726 --> 00:12:53,358
What would you have me do,

279
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,661
march into Ba sing Se with an army?

280
00:12:55,663 --> 00:12:57,129
We'd be seen as conquerors

281
00:12:57,131 --> 00:12:59,198
and greeted with nothing but war.

282
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,365
There are already wars.

283
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:02,768
The earth queen nearly
destroyed our nation.

284
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,804
This is our opportunity to change things.

285
00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:09,108
It's not going to happen.

286
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:11,210
I didn't realize at the time,

287
00:13:11,212 --> 00:13:16,215
but that moment created a rift between us.

288
00:13:16,217 --> 00:13:18,584
Kuvira turned my own son against me.

289
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:22,488
And together they plotted behind my back.

290
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,123
What do you think you're doing?

291
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,625
We're doing what you
don't have the guts to do.

292
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:29,461
We're going to Ba Sing Se
to help bring order back

293
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:30,529
to the earth kingdom.

294
00:13:30,531 --> 00:13:32,865
No. You will stay here.

295
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:34,700
And who's going to stop me?

296
00:13:34,702 --> 00:13:37,369
Your security force was more than happy

297
00:13:37,371 --> 00:13:38,170
to join my cause.

298
00:13:38,172 --> 00:13:40,305
They're some of the best
fighters in the world,

299
00:13:40,307 --> 00:13:41,840
and they are tired of being treated

300
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:43,442
like exotic birds in your cage.

301
00:13:43,444 --> 00:13:46,879
If you leave now, you will
never be welcomed back.

302
00:13:46,881 --> 00:13:50,949
When I choose to return,
it will be on my own terms.

303
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:54,253
Kuvira and Baatar left
that day with Varrick,

304
00:13:54,255 --> 00:13:57,856
my security force, and a few
of Zaofu's wealthiest citizens.

305
00:13:57,858 --> 00:14:01,894
After Kuvira proved herself
by stabilizing Ba Sing Se,

306
00:14:01,896 --> 00:14:03,962
Raiko and the other world leaders made her

307
00:14:03,964 --> 00:14:06,865
the provisional head of the earth kingdom.

308
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:08,834
Once she refused to step down,

309
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:10,602
I knew it was only a matter of time

310
00:14:10,604 --> 00:14:12,738
until she made her way back here.

311
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,840
- I want to fix this.
- You can.

312
00:14:14,842 --> 00:14:18,243
Go into the Avatar state
and demolish her army.

313
00:14:18,245 --> 00:14:21,213
Remove Kuvira from power once and for all.

314
00:14:21,215 --> 00:14:23,682
Fighting is something the old me would do,

315
00:14:23,684 --> 00:14:26,585
but that always made things worse.

316
00:14:26,587 --> 00:14:28,420
Let me talk with Kuvira.

317
00:14:28,422 --> 00:14:29,922
Maybe I can reason with her.

318
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:33,826
Kuvira doesn't listen to reason.

319
00:14:49,843 --> 00:14:52,344
I can't believe Kuvira locked me in here

320
00:14:52,346 --> 00:14:53,478
like a prisoner.

321
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,580
I'm not feeling well.

322
00:14:54,582 --> 00:14:56,315
I think I'm running out of air.

323
00:14:56,317 --> 00:14:57,816
Zhu Li, hold your breath.

324
00:14:57,818 --> 00:14:59,017
I'm not holding my breath.

325
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:01,954
Great. Now we're both gonna die.

326
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:03,655
Varrick.

327
00:15:03,657 --> 00:15:04,323
Varrick.

328
00:15:04,325 --> 00:15:07,793
Ugh, and the head voices are back.

329
00:15:08,394 --> 00:15:09,995
Bolin, thank goodness you're here.

330
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:12,531
Where did that hatch come
from? Forget the hatch.

331
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:14,766
There's something important
I've got to tell you.

332
00:15:14,768 --> 00:15:16,635
Well, there's something important

333
00:15:16,637 --> 00:15:18,604
I've got to tell you too.

334
00:15:18,606 --> 00:15:20,672
Kuvira's crazy.

335
00:15:20,674 --> 00:15:21,573
How'd you find out?

336
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:23,842
When I refused to build her a super weapon,

337
00:15:23,844 --> 00:15:24,877
she threatened my life.

338
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:27,279
She threatened me too, and
she's threatening Zaofu.

339
00:15:27,281 --> 00:15:29,414
And it turns out she's
been threatening villages

340
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,416
this whole time.

341
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:31,750
We've got to get out of here.

342
00:15:31,752 --> 00:15:35,387
I couldn't agree more, kid.

343
00:15:43,897 --> 00:15:46,265
We have an unexpected guest.

344
00:15:46,267 --> 00:15:49,735
The Avatar is here to see you.

345
00:15:51,838 --> 00:15:54,339
Korra, it's such an honor to see you again.

346
00:15:54,341 --> 00:15:57,542
The last I heard, you were
still healing in the South pole.

347
00:15:57,544 --> 00:16:00,379
Well, I'm feeling much better now.

348
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:01,647
That's wonderful news.

349
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:03,949
I'm here to ask you to back down.

350
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:06,018
Please, take your army and leave.

351
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:11,356
I think we both know
that's not going to happen.

352
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,398
I can't let you take Zaofu.

353
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,067
Look, I was tasked with bringing stability

354
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:23,568
to the earth kingdom.

355
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,504
Zaofu is the last holdout.

356
00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:27,039
Why should I treat it differently

357
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,273
than any other state?

358
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:29,808
What you're doing isn't right.

359
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,711
I understand you're just
trying to do Su a favor,

360
00:16:32,713 --> 00:16:35,080
but you can't come to
me as I'm on the verge

361
00:16:35,082 --> 00:16:37,749
of reuniting my nation and tell me to stop.

362
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:41,053
The world was descending into
chaos while you were gone.

363
00:16:41,055 --> 00:16:44,890
In order to fix it, I had
to make some tough decisions.

364
00:16:44,892 --> 00:16:46,325
I know what that's like.

365
00:16:46,327 --> 00:16:48,060
I've had plenty of people mad at me

366
00:16:48,062 --> 00:16:49,728
about decisions I've made.

367
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,595
Exactly.

368
00:16:50,597 --> 00:16:52,597
Korra, if you really want to help,

369
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:56,535
go back to Su and try to
talk some sense into her.

370
00:16:56,537 --> 00:16:58,270
Let's call a temporary truce.

371
00:16:58,272 --> 00:17:01,173
I won't make any moves
until you talk to her

372
00:17:01,175 --> 00:17:02,240
and get back to me.

373
00:17:02,242 --> 00:17:05,877
Maybe that will be for the best.

374
00:17:05,879 --> 00:17:07,045
Have you seen Bolin?

375
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:11,183
He came by to see Varrick,
but we turned him away.

376
00:17:11,185 --> 00:17:13,518
Open the door.

377
00:17:15,588 --> 00:17:19,358
We have some fugitives to catch.

378
00:17:21,928 --> 00:17:24,496
Okay, I say we go up
and around the mountains

379
00:17:24,498 --> 00:17:26,198
and sneak into Zaofu from the rear.

380
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,733
We're not going to Zaofu.

381
00:17:27,735 --> 00:17:28,867
That place is doomed.

382
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:30,229
We've got to head to Republic City.

383
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:32,738
What? No. No, no, no.
We've got to help here.

384
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,973
We'll be helping by warning the world

385
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,776
about Kuvira's potential super weapon.

386
00:17:37,778 --> 00:17:38,877
Well, that is helping,

387
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:41,213
but it's a completely
different type of helping.

388
00:17:41,215 --> 00:17:43,548
Hmm, let me think about this.

389
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,550
Ahh!

390
00:17:45,552 --> 00:17:47,219
Argh!

391
00:17:47,221 --> 00:17:49,021
Ahh!

392
00:17:51,524 --> 00:17:52,858
Argh!

393
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,627
Ahh! Ahh!

394
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:01,066
That's not the flamethrower.

395
00:18:01,068 --> 00:18:03,835
What idiot designed these things?

396
00:18:03,837 --> 00:18:04,770
You did, sir.

397
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:07,773
Less lecturing, more saving my life.

398
00:18:07,775 --> 00:18:09,574
Ugh!

399
00:18:09,576 --> 00:18:11,910
Ahh!

400
00:18:11,912 --> 00:18:14,179
Argh!

401
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:15,747
Oh!

402
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:17,482
Argh!

403
00:18:17,484 --> 00:18:20,552
Ahh!

404
00:18:20,554 --> 00:18:22,087
Ugh.

405
00:18:23,656 --> 00:18:27,259
Ahh!

406
00:18:27,261 --> 00:18:31,563
Argh!

407
00:18:39,705 --> 00:18:40,272
Argh!

408
00:18:40,274 --> 00:18:43,108
Hey, I think I figured it out.

409
00:18:44,977 --> 00:18:46,278
Ahh!

410
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,881
Sir, you're making this very difficult.

411
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:51,716
Ahh!

412
00:18:51,718 --> 00:18:54,986
Argh!

413
00:18:54,988 --> 00:18:56,855
Yah!

414
00:18:58,991 --> 00:19:01,593
Augh!

415
00:19:01,595 --> 00:19:04,863
Ahh!

416
00:19:04,865 --> 00:19:09,101
Argh!

417
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,807
Argh!

418
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:17,209
Augh!

419
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:19,778
Ahh!

420
00:19:22,648 --> 00:19:24,850
Ahh!

421
00:19:24,852 --> 00:19:26,785
Ahh-ahh!

422
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:36,761
Argh!

423
00:19:36,763 --> 00:19:37,963
Stop.

424
00:19:37,965 --> 00:19:40,799
Turn yourself over or else.

425
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:43,802
Thanks a lot, Zhu Li.

426
00:19:50,877 --> 00:19:52,944
You came back.

427
00:19:52,946 --> 00:19:53,845
When I first came here,

428
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:56,114
it was because I wanted
to tell you face-to-face

429
00:19:56,116 --> 00:19:59,885
that I never wanted to
see or hear from you again.

430
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:01,720
I wanted my words to hurt you,

431
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:04,890
so that you would know how you hurt me.

432
00:20:04,892 --> 00:20:05,690
I'm sorry.

433
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:09,794
But when I saw you, it wasn't anger I felt.

434
00:20:09,796 --> 00:20:11,129
It was sadness.

435
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:15,333
You tainted our past and
destroyed our future together.

436
00:20:15,335 --> 00:20:16,401
I want to make amends.

437
00:20:16,403 --> 00:20:20,272
I'm not sure I'll ever
be able to forgive you,

438
00:20:20,274 --> 00:20:24,342
but that doesn't mean I shouldn't try.

439
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:28,046
I thought we could play some Pai Sho,

440
00:20:28,048 --> 00:20:30,182
like we used to.

441
00:20:30,184 --> 00:20:33,585
Nothing would make me happier.

442
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,027
Augh!

443
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,897
Don't torture us.

444
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:48,700
Send these three away on the next train.

445
00:20:48,702 --> 00:20:52,571
Bolin and Zhu Li will be
going to the reeducation camp

446
00:20:52,573 --> 00:20:54,206
for our most severe dissenters.

447
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:58,076
And you will continue work
on the spirit energy project

448
00:20:58,078 --> 00:21:00,845
under close, armed supervision.

449
00:21:00,847 --> 00:21:04,082
I want it weaponized immediately.

450
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:05,917
Please, have mercy on me.

451
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,187
Don't send me away. Take me back.

452
00:21:09,189 --> 00:21:09,921
Why would I?

453
00:21:09,923 --> 00:21:14,259
Because my only mistake was
being loyal to the wrong person.

454
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:15,827
I was blindly devoted to Varrick,

455
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:18,263
and I looked past all
the times he ridiculed me

456
00:21:18,265 --> 00:21:22,400
or ordered me around or made
me clean his disgusting feet,

457
00:21:22,402 --> 00:21:25,470
because I thought he possessed
the most brilliant mind

458
00:21:25,472 --> 00:21:28,340
in the world, but when I met you,

459
00:21:28,342 --> 00:21:29,908
I realized I was wrong.

460
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,711
Compared to you, Varrick's a fool.

461
00:21:32,713 --> 00:21:34,412
Hey, come on. I'm right here.

462
00:21:34,414 --> 00:21:36,381
I believe in everything you've done,

463
00:21:36,383 --> 00:21:38,216
and I believe in your vision.

464
00:21:38,218 --> 00:21:40,485
I want to devote my life to you.

465
00:21:40,487 --> 00:21:45,390
I pledge my allegiance
to you, great uniter.

466
00:21:45,392 --> 00:21:48,393
You two could learn something from her.

467
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:49,527
Rise, Zhu Li.

468
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:51,263
I'll give you another chance.

469
00:21:51,265 --> 00:21:53,398
Think about what you're doing.

470
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,966
We're partners.

471
00:21:54,968 --> 00:21:55,834
We have history.

472
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:57,902
I did everything you ever asked of me,

473
00:21:57,904 --> 00:21:59,971
and you never appreciated it.

474
00:21:59,973 --> 00:22:01,973
Guards, do the thing.

475
00:22:01,975 --> 00:22:05,010
No, not the thing.

476
00:22:05,012 --> 00:22:07,812
Zhu Li.

477
00:22:08,881 --> 00:22:11,016
Where's Su? I have to talk to her.

478
00:22:11,018 --> 00:22:12,183
She's not here.

479
00:22:12,185 --> 00:22:13,318
She took Wing and Wei.

480
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,654
They're going to sneak into Kuvira's camp

481
00:22:15,656 --> 00:22:17,489
and put an end to this.

482
00:22:17,491 --> 00:22:19,321
No.

483
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:24,383
