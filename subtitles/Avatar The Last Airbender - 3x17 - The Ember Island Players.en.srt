1
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:38,694
Doesn’t it seem kinda weird that we’re
hiding from the Fire Lord in his own house?

2
00:01:38,995 --> 00:01:42,995
I told you, my Father hasn’t come
here since our family was actually happy.

3
00:01:43,096 --> 00:01:47,411
And that was a long time ago. This is the
last place anyone would think to look for us.

4
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:51,531
You guys are not going to
believe this. There’s a play about us.

5
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:54,581
We were just in town
and we found this poster.

6
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:57,028
What?
How is that possible?

7
00:01:57,321 --> 00:02:02,321
Listen to this. “The Boy in the Iceberg is a new
production from acclaimed playwright Pu On Tim...

8
00:02:02,442 --> 00:02:08,142
...who scoured the globe gathering information on the
Avatar from the icy South Pole to the heart of Ba Sing Se...

9
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:14,276
...His sources including singing nomads, pirates, prisoners
of war and a surprisingly knowledgeable merchant of cabbage.”

10
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,310
“Brought to you by the critically
acclaimed Ember Island Players.”

11
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:23,704
Ugh. My Mother used to take us to see them.
They butchered “Love Amongst The Dragons” every year.

12
00:02:24,716 --> 00:02:28,716
Sokka, do you really think it’s a good
idea for us to attend a play about ourselves?

13
00:02:29,127 --> 00:02:34,127
Come on, a day at the theatre? This is the kind
of wacky time wasting nonsense I’ve been missing.

14
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:48,395
Hey,
uh… I wanted to sit there.

15
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,780
Just sit next to me,
what’s the big deal?

16
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,300
I was just…
I wanted to… Okay.

17
00:02:56,163 --> 00:03:00,663
Why are we sitting in the nose bleed section?
My feet can’t see a thing from up here.

18
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:03,381
Don’t worry,
I’ll tell your feet what’s happening.

19
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,700
Actress Katara:
Sokka, my only brother.

20
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:22,396
We constantly roam these icy South Pole
seas and yet never do we find anything fulfilling.

21
00:03:23,114 --> 00:03:27,114
Actor Sokka: All I want is a
full feeling in my stomach, I’m starving!

22
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,960
Is food the only thing on your mind?

23
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:39,347
Well, I’m trying to get it out of
my mind and into my mouth. I’m starving.

24
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:43,581
This is pathetic.
My jokes are way funnier than this.

25
00:03:45,424 --> 00:03:47,424
I think he’s got you pegged.

26
00:03:47,783 --> 00:03:52,783
Everyday, the World awaits a
beacon to guide us, yet none appears.

27
00:03:52,884 --> 00:03:58,584
Still, we cannot give up hope.
For hope is all we have...

28
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:03,888
and we must never relinquish it.
Even… even to our dying breath.

29
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:09,748
Well, that’s just silly.
I don’t sound like that.

30
00:04:11,393 --> 00:04:13,893
Oh man,
this writer’s a genius.

31
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:23,065
It appears to be someone frozen in ice.
Perhaps for a hundred years.

32
00:04:23,322 --> 00:04:26,822
Actor Sokka: But who?
Who is the boy in the iceberg?

33
00:04:28,504 --> 00:04:31,004
Waterbend, hai-ya!

34
00:04:39,294 --> 00:04:41,594
Who are you, frozen boy?

35
00:04:42,754 --> 00:04:46,754
Actress Aang: I’m the Avatar, silly.
Here to spread joy and fun.

36
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:49,777
Wait,
is that a woman playing me?

37
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:05,170
An airbender. My heart is so full
of hope that it’s making me tearbend.

38
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:13,133
My stomach is so empty that
it’s making me tearbend.

39
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,148
I need meat.

40
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:20,819
But wait. Is that a
platter of meaty dumplings?

41
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:22,778
Actor Sokka:
Ooo. Where? Where?

42
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:28,508
Did I mention that
I’m an incurable prankster?

43
00:05:30,154 --> 00:05:34,654
I don’t do that. That’s not what I’m like!
And… I’m not a woman!

44
00:05:36,447 --> 00:05:38,947
Oh, they nailed you,
Twinkle Toes.

45
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,290
Actor Uncle:  Prince Zuko,
you must try this cake.

46
00:05:47,852 --> 00:05:52,652
Actor Zuko: I don’t have time to stuff my face.
I must capture the Avatar to regain my honor!

47
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:58,048
Well, while you do that,
maybe I’ll capture another slice.

48
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:00,413
You sicken me.

49
00:06:00,774 --> 00:06:03,374
They make me
totally stiff and humorless.

50
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:06,281
Actually, I think
that actor’s pretty spot on.

51
00:06:06,857 --> 00:06:08,057
How could you say that?

52
00:06:08,314 --> 00:06:12,114
Let’s forget about
the Avatar and get massages.

53
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:14,175
How could you say that?!

54
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:23,779
Hey look,
I think I found something.

55
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:33,888
It’s a flying rabbit monkey.
I think I’ll name him, Momo.

56
00:06:34,904 --> 00:06:37,904
Puppet Momo:
Hi, everybody. I love you.

57
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,319
Actor Sokka:
Does this dress make my butt look fat?

58
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:58,250
Actor Bumi: Riddles and challenges must
you face, if you are ever to leave this place.

59
00:07:13,153 --> 00:07:16,153
Actor Sokka: Why did you have
to steal that waterbending scroll?

60
00:07:16,989 --> 00:07:19,989
It just gave me so much hope!

61
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:30,428
Actor Zuko:
The Avatar is mine! Wait, who’s coming?

62
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:37,366
Actor Blue Spirit: I am the Blue Spirit.
The scourge of the Fire Nation here 
to save the Avatar.

63
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:45,109
Actress Aang: My hero.

64
00:07:57,514 --> 00:08:03,514
Actor Jet: Don’t cry, baby.
Jet will wipe out that nasty town for you.

65
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,840
Actress Katara:
Oh Jet, you’re so bad.

66
00:08:14,497 --> 00:08:19,997
Actress Aang: Look, it’s The Great Divide.
The biggest canyon in the Earth Kingdom.

67
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:23,605
Actor Sokka:
Meh. Let’s keep flying.

68
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:30,613
Actor Sokka: Don’t go, Yue. You’re the only
woman whose ever taken my mind off of food.

69
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:35,425
Wait,
did you have pickled fish for dinner?

70
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,260
Actress Yue: Goodbye, Sokka.
I have important Moon duties to take care of.

71
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:43,861
And yes, I did have pickled fish.

72
00:08:45,203 --> 00:08:48,003
You never told me you
made out with the Moon Spirit.

73
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,900
Shh.
I’m trying to watch.

74
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:05,125
Actress Aang:
The Avatar is back to save the day! Yay!

75
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:24,244
So far, this intermission
is the best part of the play.

76
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:28,579
Apparently, the playwright thinks I’m an
idiot who tells bad jokes about meat all the time.

77
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:32,603
Yeah, you tell bad jokes
about plenty of other topics.

78
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:34,052
I know!

79
00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:36,743
Aang: At least this
Sokka actor kinda looks like you.

80
00:09:36,888 --> 00:09:39,888
That woman playing the
Avatar doesn’t resemble me at all.

81
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:44,139
I don’t know, you are more in touch
with your feminine side than most guys.

82
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,970
Relax, Aang.
They’re not accurate portrayals.

83
00:09:47,998 --> 00:09:54,698
It’s not like I’m a preachy crybaby who can’t resist
giving overemotional speeches about hope all the time.

84
00:09:56,237 --> 00:09:57,237
What?

85
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,364
Yeah.
That’s not you at all.

86
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:03,853
Listen, friends. It’s obvious
that the playwright did his research.

87
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:07,948
I know it must hurt but what you’re
seeing up there on that stage is the truth.

88
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:11,834
Well,
here we are in the Earth Kingdom.

89
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:16,737
I better have a look around to see
if I can find an earthbending teacher.

90
00:10:16,973 --> 00:10:19,573
This is it! This must
be where I come in.

91
00:10:22,648 --> 00:10:28,648
I flew all over town but I couldn’t
find a single earthbending master.

92
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,391
Here it comes.

93
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:35,633
Actor Toph: You can’t find an earthbending
master in the sky, you have to look underground.

94
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:38,404
Who are you?

95
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:44,139
My name is Toph because it sounds
like tough. And that’s just what I am.

96
00:10:44,232 --> 00:10:50,732
Wait a minute, I sound like…
a guy. A really buff guy.

97
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:54,569
Well Toph, what you hear up
there is the truth. It hurts, doesn’t it?

98
00:10:54,746 --> 00:11:01,446
Are you kidding me? I wouldn’t have cast it
any other way. At least it’s not a flying bald lady.

99
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:06,412
So, you’re blind?

100
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:13,801
I can see you doing that. I see everything
that you see except that I don’t see like you do.

101
00:11:13,828 --> 00:11:16,828
I release a sonic wave from my mouth.

102
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:26,486
There.
I got a pretty good look at you.

103
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,480
Zuko, it’s time we had a talk.
About your hair. It’s gone too far.

104
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:40,628
Maybe it’s best if we…
split up.

105
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,437
Actor Zuko: Azula! My sister.
What are you doing here?

106
00:11:47,644 --> 00:11:52,844
You caught me. Wait.
What’s that? I think it’s your honor.

107
00:11:53,015 --> 00:11:54,215
Actor Zuko: Where?

108
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,370
Actress Katara:
She escaped. But how?

109
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:07,493
Actress Aang: If she continues
drilling this wall will come down for sure.

110
00:12:10,505 --> 00:12:17,505
Haha, yes! Continue drilling.
The city of Ba Sing Se can’t hide no longer.

111
00:12:33,678 --> 00:12:36,978
Actress Aang:
No, Jet! What did they do to you?

112
00:12:37,226 --> 00:12:44,726
Actor Jet:
Must. Serve. Earth King! Must… Destroy!

113
00:12:55,444 --> 00:12:57,644
Did Jet just… die?

114
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:00,379
You know,
it was really unclear.

115
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:05,822
I have to admit, Prince Zuko.
I really find you attractive.

116
00:13:06,014 --> 00:13:08,314
You don’t have to make fun of me.

117
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:14,231
But I mean it. I had eyes for you
since the day you first captured me.

118
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:19,278
Wait.
I thought you were the Avatar’s girl.

119
00:13:21,423 --> 00:13:25,923
The Avatar? Why,
he’s like a little brother to me.

120
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:35,157
I certainly don’t think of him in a romantic way.
Besides, how could he ever find out about this.

121
00:13:36,874 --> 00:13:41,174
Oh, you’re getting up?
Can you get me some fire flakes?

122
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:44,853
Oh and fire gummies.

123
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:54,046
Actress Azula: Well, my brother. What’s it
going to be? Your nation or a life of treachery?

124
00:13:56,289 --> 00:13:59,289
Choose treachery, it’s more fun.

125
00:14:00,753 --> 00:14:02,453
No way!

126
00:14:06,814 --> 00:14:12,014
I hate you, Uncle.
You smell and I hate you for all time.

127
00:14:15,726 --> 00:14:17,726
You didn’t really say that,
did you?

128
00:14:17,935 --> 00:14:19,235
I might as well have.

129
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:42,774
Avatar State, yip yip.

130
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:54,157
Not if my lightning can’t help it!

131
00:15:03,753 --> 00:15:07,253
The Avatar is no more!

132
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:16,432
Suki: It seems like every time there’s
a big battle you guys barely make it out alive.

133
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:18,145
I mean,
you guys lose a lot.

134
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,800
You’re one to talk, Suki. Didn’t Azula
take you captive? That’s right, she did.

135
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:26,363
Are you trying
to get on my bad side?

136
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:27,806
I’m just saying.

137
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:29,658
Does anyone know where Aang is?

138
00:15:29,843 --> 00:15:34,043
He left to get me fire gummies like,
10 minutes ago. And I’m still waiting.

139
00:15:34,856 --> 00:15:36,356
I’m going to check outside.

140
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:47,595
Are you alright?

141
00:15:47,895 --> 00:15:50,895
No, I’m not.
I hate this play.

142
00:15:51,677 --> 00:15:54,877
I know it’s upsetting but
it sounds like you’re overreacting.

143
00:15:54,991 --> 00:16:00,691
Overreacting? If I hadn’t blocked my chakra,
I’d probably be in the Avatar State right now.

144
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,596
Little Boy: Wheeee.

145
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:08,613
Suki, what are the chances
you can get me backstage?

146
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:11,204
I got some jokes
I want to give to the actor me.

147
00:16:11,745 --> 00:16:16,545
I’m an elite warrior who’s trained
for many years in the art of stealth.

148
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,600
I think I can get you backstage.

149
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,660
Jeez. Everyone’s getting
so upset about their characters.

150
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:27,867
Even you seem more down than
usual and that’s saying something.

151
00:16:28,142 --> 00:16:30,442
You don’t get it.
It’s different for you.

152
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:35,782
You get a muscley version of yourself taking
down 10 bad guys at once and making sassy remarks.

153
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,000
Yeah,
that’s pretty great.

154
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:43,106
But for me, it takes all the mistakes
I’ve made in my life and shove them back in my face.

155
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:49,166
My Uncle. He’s always been on my side
even when things were bad. He was there for me.

156
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:52,622
He taught me so much
and how do I repay him?

157
00:16:52,776 --> 00:16:58,876
With a knife in his back. It’s my greatest
regret and I may never get to redeem myself.

158
00:16:59,762 --> 00:17:04,662
You have redeemed yourself to your Uncle.
You don’t realize it but you already have.

159
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:05,663
How do you know?

160
00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:11,106
Because I once had a long conversation
with the guy and all he would talk about was you.

161
00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:14,486
- Really?
- Yeah, and it was kind of annoying.

162
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:15,850
Oh, sorry.

163
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:17,566
But it was also very sweet.

164
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:22,275
All your Uncle wanted was for you
to find your own path and see the light.

165
00:17:22,502 --> 00:17:25,202
Now you’re here with us.
He’d be proud.

166
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,210
Ow. What was that for?

167
00:17:29,742 --> 00:17:31,242
That’s how I show affection.

168
00:17:33,347 --> 00:17:37,347
Your Zuko costume is pretty good
but your scar’s on the wrong side.

169
00:17:38,443 --> 00:17:40,643
The scar is not on the wrong side!

170
00:17:48,815 --> 00:17:50,315
He’s coming this way.

171
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,445
Can I help you?

172
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,300
Actually,
I think I can help you.

173
00:17:56,484 --> 00:18:00,584
I’m a big Sokka fan but I don’t think you’re
representing him quite as well as you could be.

174
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,538
Oh no…
another fan with ideas.

175
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:07,899
Just hear me out. Here’s something
I think the real Sokka would say.

176
00:18:08,578 --> 00:18:11,878
“What does the cabbage
merchant use to fix his cabbages?”

177
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:13,849
“A cabbage patch”

178
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:19,390
That’s actually pretty good.
Let me see those.

179
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:24,249
Haha.
Rocky relationship. Not bad.

180
00:18:25,068 --> 00:18:27,568
Also, don’t be afraid
to make up some phrases.

181
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:31,839
Especially before an attack.
Something like “Flying Kick-A-Pow!”

182
00:18:32,353 --> 00:18:35,853
- Who are you, anyway?
- I’m just a guy who likes comedy.

183
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:40,019
Katara, did you really
mean what you said in there?

184
00:18:40,176 --> 00:18:42,676
In where?
What are you talking about?

185
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:49,325
On stage. When you said I was just like a
brother to you and you didn’t have feelings for me.

186
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:51,966
I didn’t say that.
An actor said that.

187
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:53,841
But it’s true, isn’t it?

188
00:18:54,011 --> 00:18:59,011
We kissed at the invasion and I thought
we were going to be together but we’re not.

189
00:18:59,647 --> 00:19:02,147
Aang, I don’t know.

190
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:04,029
Why don’t you know?

191
00:19:04,322 --> 00:19:08,122
Because we’re in the middle of a war
and we have other things to worry about.

192
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:10,033
This isn’t the right time.

193
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,420
Well, when is the right time?

194
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:16,785
Aang, I’m sorry but right now,
I’m just a little confused.

195
00:19:22,316 --> 00:19:24,316
I just said that I was confused.

196
00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:28,383
I’m going inside.

197
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:33,773
Argh! I’m such an idiot!

198
00:19:39,365 --> 00:19:44,165
Here’s what you missed. We went to the Fire Nation
and you got better and Katara was the Painted Lady

199
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:47,215
and I got a sword and
I think Combustion Man died.

200
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,516
Ooo look,
The Invasion’s about to start. Shh.

201
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:58,178
I just want to let you know Aang,
that I’ll always love you. Like a brother.

202
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,458
I wouldn’t want it any other way.

203
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,640
Hey Toph, would you say you
and Aang have a rocky relationship?

204
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,219
I told him to say that.

205
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:26,262
I hope everyone’s ready
for The Invasion. Slop-A-Pow!

206
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:39,175
We finally made it to the
royal palace but no one’s home.

207
00:20:39,622 --> 00:20:43,122
Actually,
I’m home and I want to join you.

208
00:20:43,824 --> 00:20:46,324
I guess we have no choice.
Come on.

209
00:20:48,878 --> 00:20:51,878
I guess that’s it. The play’s
caught up to the present now.

210
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,090
Wait.
The play’s not over.

211
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:58,666
But it is over.
Unless… This is the future.

212
00:21:01,455 --> 00:21:08,455
Actor Ozai: With the energy harnessed from
that comet, no one will be able to stop the Fire Nation!

213
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Father, Zuko and the Avatar are
at the palace. They’re trying to stop you.

214
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:20,276
You take care of Zuko.
I shall face the Avatar myself.

215
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:29,783
Aang, you fight the Fire Lord,
I’ll hold her off.

216
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,880
You are no longer my brother.
You are an enemy.

217
00:21:35,465 --> 00:21:39,665
No,
I am the rightful heir to the throne!

218
00:21:40,491 --> 00:21:42,991
We’ll see.

219
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:56,463
Honor!

220
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:13,456
Actor Ozai:
So, you have mastered all 4 elements?

221
00:22:13,671 --> 00:22:16,671
Yeah and now,
you’re going down.

222
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:24,407
No, it is you who are going down.
You see, you are too late.

223
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:29,729
The comet is already
here and I’m unstoppable.

224
00:22:52,105 --> 00:23:02,105
Nooo…

225
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:06,114
It is over, Father.
We’ve done it.

226
00:23:06,348 --> 00:23:08,848
Yes, we have done it!

227
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:15,717
The dreams of my Father, and my
Father’s Father have now been realized.

228
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:19,227
The World is mine.

229
00:23:30,248 --> 00:23:32,448
Zuko:
That… wasn’t a good play.

230
00:23:32,969 --> 00:23:34,569
- Aang: I’ll say.
- Katara: No kidding.

231
00:23:34,722 --> 00:23:36,722
- Suki: Horrible.
- Toph: You said it.

232
00:23:36,923 --> 00:23:38,923
But the effects were decent.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
