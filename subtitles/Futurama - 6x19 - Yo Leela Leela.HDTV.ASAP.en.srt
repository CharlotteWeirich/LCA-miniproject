Hi, kids.

What book would you
like me to read first?

uh, tell a story.

38

00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,990
(scanner warbling)

166
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,960
(digital squeaking)

167
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,160
Holy moly!

168
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,700
Lady, you don't know me,

169
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,070
but my name is
Abner Doubledeal.

170
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,870
Wait, I know you.

171
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,740
You're Abner Doubledeal.

172
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,740
I brain-scanned those little
nose-pickers during your story,

173
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,210
and, sister,
their enjoyment glands

174
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,880
were squirting
like Broadway roadkill!

175
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,680
Aw, they were?

176
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,550
Say, you seem
like a smart mark.

177
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,680
How'd you like to make
it into a TV show?

178
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,520
Sign here on this, uh...

179
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,620
Supercuts coupon.

180
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,820
I don't know.

181
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,990
Don't I need a degree

182
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,760
to write gibberish for toddlers?

183
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,190
Come on, Miss Leela.

184
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,730
Don't be a fraidy cat
like Feffernoose.

185
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Okay. I'll do it

186
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,300
to show you kids
you can succeed at anything,

187
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,670
if you just luck out
hard enough.

188
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,600
Welcome to the glamorous,
big-money world

189
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,540
of basic cable TV!

190
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,340
I'm going to need
that pen back.

191
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,060
Working on a real TV
show is so exciting.

192
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,060
I'm on a mostly natural high.

193
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,170
These costumes are gonna make it
hard to go to the bathroom.

194
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,900
I'm not having any problem.

195
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,910
We're shooting in five minutes,

196
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,810
and this Leela broad hasn't
even delivered a script yet!

197
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,080
Sweet zombie Jesus,
like it's not hard enough

198
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,080
to make a freakin' TV show
for under 50 bucks.

199
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,180
Damn it.
I'll call you back, Grandma.

200
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,620
Nice of you to show up, toots.

201
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,950
I mean that sincerely.

202
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,150
It's just that I'm in show biz.

203
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,920
Sorry, I went to my
quiet place to write.

204
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,060
Here's the script.

205
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,660
Ach! You writers
make me sick.

206
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,860
Nice job on the script, though.

207
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,060
Places, everyone!

208
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay. Cheap lights.

209
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,970
Off-brand camera.

210
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,470
(whirring)

211
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,510
And non-union action!

212
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,180
I like ice cream.

213
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,550
(slurping)

214
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,180
And I like lollipops.

215
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,120
(slurping)

216
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,150
And I like you,
Princess Num-Num.

217
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,590

220
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,630
I don't understand.

221
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,560
When I like something,
I lick it.

222
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,930

that don't want to be licked.

227
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,910
But how do I know what to lick

228
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,110
and what not to lick?

229
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,840
It's very simple.

Well, that's all for today.

But before we go,

let's do everything we just did

two more times.

244

Leela, that was great!

245
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,710
Even I have
to admire the performance

246
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,980
of me, Bender.

247
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,710
The show looks so cute.

248
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,910
Kids will love it!

249
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,180
And it looks so cruddy,

250
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,880
their ironic hipster parents

251
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,590
will love it.

252
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,690
Thanks, guys, but
let's be realistic.

253
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,460
We all know any TV show
that's even slightly good

254
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,790

Turanga Leela

alongside so many
inferior shows.

283
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,080
And to all

284
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,650
my young friends
at the orphanarium,

285
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,850
thank you for inspiring me
to be your hero.

286

Slurm her!

287
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,700
So, wait. You play
a high school student

288
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,570
who's also secretly a rock star who's also
secretly a massage chair?

289
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,570
No. I play a high school student
who's also secretly a rock star,

290
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,910
but in real life
I'm a massage chair.

291
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,480
Oh. You ever made out
with a tugboat.

292
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,140
(whistle blows)

293
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,810
Guys, I didn't have time
to mention it up there,

294
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,710
but I want each of you to know

295
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,520
what an honor it is
to work with me.

296
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,220
Sweet ego of Montego!

297
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,150
Someone build a wind farm
in front of her mouth!

298
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,220
Leela, I mean this:
you're the greatest creative mind

299
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,890
since blah, blah,
blah-bity blah.

300
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,560
But it's 2:00 a.m. and you still haven't
written tomorrow's episode.

301
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,730
Well, you can't expect me
to write it here

302
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,930
with everyone talking so loudly
about how great I am.

303
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,170
Sorry.
I'm taking the ship to my quiet place

304
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,800

Noncreative? Ha!

307
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,080
I'll have you know
I bedazzle my own underpants.

309
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,260
That was a hell of a massage.

310
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,160
Maybe the best that ever was.

311

It's real!

315
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,710
I love eating vegetables,
don't you?

316
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,110
They're like crunchy,
green water.

317
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,910
I don't like 'em!
They're icky-yuckie!

318
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,220
(giggles) Now, now, Garbly,
if we don't eat our vegetables,

319
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,450
we won't grow big and strong,

320
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,020
like Feffernoose.

321
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:52,860
I had to be big and strong
to fight off the monsters.

322
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,830
Did somebody say monsters?!

323

(laughs)

324
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,200
This will make a great episode.

Well, well, well.
(gasps)

327
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,210
You didn't make up
that TV show.

328
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,040
You just wrote down
what these space twerps said.

329
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,110
Oh, hell.

from those poor,
innocent creatures

340

341
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,330
I underestimated you.

342
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,930
Wait. I can explain.

Nah, don't ruin it.

I'm loving the hypocrisy.

It's like catching an evangelist
in a whorehouse.

346
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,570
That was
the best Christmas ever.

347
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,110
You know I hate lying.

348
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,510
But those orphans
were so proud of me,

349
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,410
I couldn't bear
to let them down.

350
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,680
(sputters)
At least Reverend Pickens had the dignity

351
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,480
to jump out
the whorehouse window

352
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,320
with his pants
around his ankles.

353
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,920
Who's your friend, Leela?

354
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,220
He sure has a shiny
metal bumbledy-boop.

355
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,090
Aw, they're so cute
and harmless.

356
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,560
No wonder you feel safe
ripping off their act.

357
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,960
Bender, I feel
bad enough already.

358

I'm just messin' with you.

359

I love that you're
getting rich off of them.

rich off of you.

361

00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,400
From now on, you give me

363

364

Oh, fine. You'll get your cut.

365
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,480
I don't really care
about the money anyway.

366
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,280
I just want to show those poor,
disadvantaged orphans

367
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,350

Leela, you may have become
a Lady Gaga-esque fame hag,

378
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,490
but you sure cheered up
those orphans.

379
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,920
Nice job.

380
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,290

381
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,630
Thanks so much
for inviting us to the taping.

382
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,360
The kids haven't been
this excited since Food Day.

383
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,860
Ah, thanks.

384
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,360
They're my inspiration.

385
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,200
But not my only inspiration,
am I right, Leels?

386
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,940

387

388
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,240
Is somebody standing on me?

389
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,780
Ah. I do love inconveniencing
the underclass.

390
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,580
Well, we'll be on our way.

391
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,550
After we dig through your trash
for aluminum.

392
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,950
Okay, kids, delta pattern.
Go! Go! Go!

393
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,450
(excited shouting)

394
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,990
Miss Leela?

395
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,260
Yes, Sally?

396
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,090
I want to show you
the story I made up.

397
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,000
That's Gumdrop, Sticky, Candycorn,
Sourball, and Jujube.

398
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,870
They're brothers and sisters

399
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,170
and they live
in Butterscotch Hollow.

400
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,410
Sally, that's wonderful.

401
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,370
You came up with that yourself?

402
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,510
Out of thin air?

403
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:16,980
How?

404
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,610
You were an orphan,

405
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,320
and now you're
the best writer ever.

406
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,690
So I knew I could write, too.

407
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,190
Thank you for being my hero.

408
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,120
I can't do this anymore.

409
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,590
I don't blame you.

410
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,090
Having to wear a costume

411
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,660
made from a
hollowed-out walrus.

412
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,030
Everyone, I have a confession.

413
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
I Turanga Leela,

414
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,070
winner of a Young People's
Choice Award,

415
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,270
a Peabody Jr.
and two Training Emmys,

416
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,170
am not what I appear to be.

417
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,980
There's something
I need to show you.

418
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,110
Uh-oh.

419
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,220
Continuing my confession,

420
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,290
this is the hardest
thing I've ever done.

421
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,220
Harder than creating
the best-est show in the world?

422
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,560
I didn't create anything.
I stole it.

423
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,060
Stealing is a form
of creativity.

424
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,260
No, it isn't.

425
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,060
Guys, come on out.

426
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,240
(all gasping)
Holy moly again.

427
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,070
Oh, hello, Leela.

428
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,640
I was just telling my friends

429
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,640
how they shouldn't eat food
off the floor.

430
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,410
Should we sing a song about it?

431
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,440
Yes, please.

432
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,010
No need, Ladybuggle.

433
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,410
Say, what's going on here?

434
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,080
(sighs)

435
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,280
This planet is the
real Rumbledy-Hump,

436
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,250
and these creatures are
the real Humplings.

437
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,960
All I did was write down their
adorably repetitious hijinks.

438
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,030
(gasps)
You lied?

439
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,530
Like Doingg did when he stole
Garbly's pet pinecone?

440
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,460
You told them about that?

441
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,530
I should have told
the truth right away.

442
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,170
These simple prairie folk have
a simple prairie-ish life here,

443
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,710
and I was wrong
to exploit it for profit.

444
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,040
I'm as sad as
an upside down smile.

445
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,710
You mean a frown?

446
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,210
We didn't have a word
for it... until now.

447
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,850
To think I put on an unflattering
cupcake costume for you.

448
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,250
To think I borrowed
money from you.

449
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,620
I was going to ask you
to marry me.

450
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,130
I guess if you can't
make up stories,

451
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,030
I can't neither.

452
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,430
I deserve this.

453
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,900
And more.

454
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,130
Keep it coming.

455
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,030
Wait a second.

456
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,970
As a big Hollywood TV producer,

457
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,740

and put it on TV.

467

Who said anything
about ripping them off?

468
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,870
I did.

469
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,200
I'm paying 'em.

470

473

474
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,520
our lives are a jillion times
better.

475

486
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,510
Oh, God, what have I done?!

487
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:35,040
You've given us a new father
and a full-time job.

488
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,150
Which is more than
most kids have.

489
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,450
But...

490
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,180
We love it here, Miss Leela.

491
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,280
This is the funnest planet
in the whole world.

492
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,090
Don't hug me!

493
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,550
I've done a horrible thing!

494
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,660
For God's sake,
somebody teach me a lesson!

495
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:54,259
(chanting):
We love Leela, we love Leela (and so on)

496
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,800
No!

497
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,780
