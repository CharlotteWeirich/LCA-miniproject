1
00:00:02,853 --> 00:00:06,528
Futurama is brought to you
by Molten Boron.

2
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:09,531
Nobody doesn 't like Molten Boron!

3
00:00:14,853 --> 00:00:16,969
The Problem with Popplers

4
00:00:42,213 --> 00:00:44,966
I hate the Moochers.
They offer you a drink. . .

5
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:47,807
. . .but their wallet's always
in the other pants. . .

6
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:50,089
. . .which they borrowed from me!

7
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:51,328
Dinner ready?

8
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:53,922
The Moochers cleaned out our pantry.

9
00:00:54,173 --> 00:00:58,086
All they left was baking soda
and capers. And here it is!

10
00:00:59,573 --> 00:01:02,690
Great. We're two days from Earth
with no food.

11
00:01:02,893 --> 00:01:07,648
Fight to the death. I'll cook the
loser. Work his gut. I like it tender.

12
00:01:07,853 --> 00:01:12,768
Maybe that planet has a drive-thru!
Burger Jerk, Fishy Joe's or Chiseler.

13
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:15,726
No, we're a billion miles
from nowhere.

14
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:18,612
It probably only has
a Howard Johnson's.

15
00:01:23,453 --> 00:01:27,412
A type-M planet, so it should at least
have Rodden berries.

16
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:31,162
I'm good at foraging.
I found mushrooms on my bathmat.

17
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:34,331
I found some rocks!
You eat rocks, right?

18
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:37,001
Not even sautéed in a little mud?

19
00:01:37,213 --> 00:01:39,727
Look! A ditch full of fried shrimp!

20
00:01:39,973 --> 00:01:44,364
Are you blind? Looks more
like a hole full of fried prawns.

21
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:52,482
This thing on my wrist says
they're not poisonous.

22
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:55,890
Well, how are they?

23
00:02:01,373 --> 00:02:06,208
They're great! They're like sex!
Except I'm having them!

24
00:02:06,413 --> 00:02:08,529
These would go great with rocks!

25
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:10,001
Look! Here's more!

26
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,125
-The planet's full of them!
-I'll take a few.

27
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:17,406
-No! A whole Bender-ful!
-Only what we need. Stuff the ship!

28
00:02:23,653 --> 00:02:26,565
Planet Express ship,
you are cleared to land.

29
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:28,092
Roger!

30
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,087
Oh, man! I'm inhaling these things!

31
00:02:35,293 --> 00:02:38,285
You guys scored some primo stuff here!

32
00:02:38,653 --> 00:02:42,692
They're tastier than a penguin nest.
What do you call them?

33
00:02:42,893 --> 00:02:46,966
-No name yet.
-They're tasty. What about Tasty-cles?

34
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:50,211
-Not that.
-Why not?

35
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:54,048
It sounds like frozen
mountain oysters on a stick.

36
00:02:54,253 --> 00:02:56,289
You know, Test-cicles.

37
00:02:56,533 --> 00:03:00,082
The only names not yet trademarked
are. . .

38
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:02,124
. . .Popplers and Zittzers.

39
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,006
-We'll call them "Popplers" !
-Yeah. Why not?

40
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:06,646
-You picked it.
-Swish!

41
00:03:07,893 --> 00:03:11,488
Call them what you want.
I call them a free meal.

42
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:13,809
Slow down there, Sigmund!

43
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:16,886
I can't stand poor people
getting free food.

44
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:19,089
We gotta sell these things!

45
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,324
-Good idea!
-Bender's a genius!

46
00:03:25,693 --> 00:03:30,687
-Business is great.
-Great's okay. Amazing would be great!

47
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,211
Don't push!
There's hot dogs for everyone!

48
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:40,886
Where do you want those rat droppings
you ordered?

49
00:03:44,413 --> 00:03:47,689
You're not the guy who delivers
the rat droppings!

50
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:51,283
Popplers? Never heard of them!

51
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:52,886
Eat it or beat it!

52
00:03:55,373 --> 00:03:56,488
These are great!

53
00:03:56,733 --> 00:04:01,090
Boys, this is your lucky day!
I'm Joe Gillman.

54
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:05,691
-You're a guy who eats at Fishy Joe's?
-Hell, no! I am Fishy Joe!

55
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:09,482
I've got a fast-food franchise
on every planet.

56
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,007
Except McPluto.

57
00:04:11,213 --> 00:04:14,728
I wanted to write you about
the in-store kiddie parks.

58
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:19,888
-The slides won't support a robot.
-Not interested. But these are great!

59
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:21,885
-How much?
-$1 a dozen.

60
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:25,125
You'll never make money.
Supply them to me. . .

61
00:04:25,373 --> 00:04:30,083
. . .and I'll sell them for $2 a dozen.
I'll even pay you $1 a dozen.

62
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:33,490
I'll be rich! You too,
but that doesn't excite me.

63
00:04:33,693 --> 00:04:34,682
How do we sign?

64
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:40,525
Pop a Poppler at Fishy Joe's

65
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,928
It's a mystery
Where they're from no one knows

66
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:46,483
Pick them, lick them, chew them,
Stick them, if you won 't sue

67
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,212
Shove one up your nose

68
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,289
I can't pay.

69
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:14,485
That's the second billboard this week!

70
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:18,612
Sorry. I was distracted
by those protesters outside.

71
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:32,931
Unless this is a nude love-in,
get the hell off my property!

72
00:05:33,653 --> 00:05:36,213
You can't own property, man!

73
00:05:36,413 --> 00:05:39,132
I can, because I'm not
a penniless hippie!

74
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:40,852
What do you want?

75
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:44,284
We're with Mankind
for Ethical Animal Treatment!

76
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:48,806
Popplers are living creatures.
Stop harvesting them for food!

77
00:05:49,013 --> 00:05:52,449
-Or what?
-Or we'll boycott Fishy Joe's!

78
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:55,121
You're vegetarians. Who cares?

79
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,482
Shut up!

80
00:05:56,693 --> 00:05:59,048
Animals eat animals. It's nature.

81
00:05:59,253 --> 00:06:02,882
No, it isn't.
We taught a lion to eat tofu.

82
00:06:05,173 --> 00:06:09,405
The point is, you shouldn't eat things
that feel pain--

83
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:13,288
-Okay, we won't eat you!
-I'll go get some more bricks.

84
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,086
I wish you'd throw out
these old Popplers.

85
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,609
They're getting big and scaly.
There's one left.

86
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:22,487
Mama!

87
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:37,609
Stop! Stop eating Popplers!

88
00:06:37,973 --> 00:06:39,531
-Why?
-My booze!

89
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,089
Popplers are intelligent!
This one called me mama!

90
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:46,888
Congratulations!
I assume Amy is the father?

91
00:06:47,093 --> 00:06:48,572
Popplers can't talk.

92
00:06:48,773 --> 00:06:52,812
She's hallucinating from lack
of Popplers. Eat some now!

93
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:56,050
-No!
-I said eat! Come on, mangia !

94
00:06:57,733 --> 00:07:00,486
-Sorry, babies.
-Maybe you should lie down.

95
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:02,490
Yes, listen to the father.

96
00:07:02,693 --> 00:07:07,084
I'm telling you it spoke to me.
Come on, little Poppler. Say mama?

97
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:11,283
Hearing one talk
doesn't mean it's intelligent.

98
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:16,487
-Parrots talk and we eat them, right?
-Maybe it learned as a parlor trick.

99
00:07:16,693 --> 00:07:18,684
-Like Fry.
-Like Fry! Like Fry!

100
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:23,887
There's one way, and only one way, to
determine if an animal is intelligent.

101
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:25,765
Dissect its brain.

102
00:07:25,973 --> 00:07:28,851
No! Mama! Stop Grandpa!

103
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:32,932
Enough chitchat!
Restrain the specimen!

104
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:38,091
-Good.
-Give me some of that special sauce.

105
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:47,286
Stop eating Popplers! They can talk!

106
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,888
Don't stop to talk! Eat Popplers!

107
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:53,887
-Cut it out!
-Take a coupon! Cut it out!

108
00:08:00,653 --> 00:08:04,851
I won't let you enter! Popplers
are as intelligent as you or me!

109
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:06,042
You, maybe.

110
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:13,044
Hear me, hear me!

111
00:08:13,253 --> 00:08:15,084
Stop eating Popplers!

112
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:20,088
Stop eating them with honey mustard
sauce, tangy sweet and sour sauce!

113
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,370
Stop eating the fiesta Popplers salad!

114
00:08:23,573 --> 00:08:26,451
Stop taking advantage
of the cheaper 1 2-pack!

115
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:34,325
Stop enjoying Popplers on the patio,
in the car or on the boat.

116
00:08:34,573 --> 00:08:37,087
Wherever good times are had--

117
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:44,526
Tonight on Date Night.

118
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:47,890
Popplers. Eating them.
Is it all right?

119
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:52,086
With us, the CEO of Fishy Joe's,
Mr. "Fishy" Joseph Gillman.

120
00:08:52,293 --> 00:08:55,603
Noted anti-eating activist,
Free Waterfall, Junior.

121
00:08:55,813 --> 00:08:59,328
And the Popplers discoverer,
Captain Taronga Leela.

122
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:02,491
-Taronga?
-That's her name, Philip.

123
00:09:02,693 --> 00:09:05,605
Is it wrong to eat
intelligent animals?

124
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:09,328
Absolutely not.
No one's here to make that claim.

125
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:10,932
-I am.
-Me too.

126
00:09:11,173 --> 00:09:15,325
We're talking about a snack
low in fat and high in profit.

127
00:09:15,573 --> 00:09:17,609
You're crazy, man. He is crazy.

128
00:09:17,813 --> 00:09:21,362
-There isn 't evidence of intelligence.
-Shut up, shut up.

129
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:27,364
-Not true. This one talks. Say mama.
-Ca-ca.

130
00:09:27,573 --> 00:09:28,847
We'll bleep that.

131
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:31,328
I'm not saying eating meat
is wrong.

132
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:34,133
-No one's here to make that claim.
-I am!

133
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,689
-Eating smart animals is different.
-Shut up, shut up.

134
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:40,532
Don 't force your tired philosophy
on us.

135
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:44,089
The reason we don 't eat people
is the lousy taste.

136
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,648
You're nuts. Shut up. Let me talk.

137
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,809
-You shut up.
-No, you shut up.

138
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:53,803
Popplers are no smarter than any other
animal I've served, cats included.

139
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:58,808
-Ca-ca head. Mean, old ca-ca head.
-Sir, I'm making a point.

140
00:09:59,013 --> 00:10:04,087
If these gutter-mouths are so smart,
why don 't they defend themselves?

141
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:07,931
-Stop it!
-I call murder on that!

142
00:10:08,853 --> 00:10:12,892
I'm willing to grant it's murder.
The real issue is...

143
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,289
... who 's gonna stop me?

144
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:27,889
We seem to be experiencing
technical difficulties.

145
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:30,488
And crap like I've never seen!

146
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:35,682
People of Earth, I am Lure of the
planet Omicron Persei Eight.

147
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:38,164
Turn down the TV, lndunda.

148
00:10:38,373 --> 00:10:40,045
Dear Lord, they're back!

149
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:42,528
-We're doomed!
-Doomed!

150
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,484
Doomed!

151
00:10:47,693 --> 00:10:52,926
The creatures you call Popplers come
from a nursery planet in our sector.

152
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:55,971
You monsters have been eating
our babies!

153
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:02,406
We demandjustice!

154
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:06,931
As you ate our children,
so shall you be eaten by us!

155
00:11:07,173 --> 00:11:10,722
We'll begin with the firemen,
then the math teachers...

156
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:14,886
...and so on in that fashion
until everyone is eaten.

157
00:11:18,173 --> 00:11:20,084
Transmission over!

158
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:22,892
Well, that went okay.

159
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:27,883
When you know you can 't scratch,
that's when you really have to.

160
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:32,252
Oh, yeah! That feels a lot better--
What? It's still on?

161
00:11:36,013 --> 00:11:38,288
I speak for all of Earth. . .

162
00:11:38,493 --> 00:11:41,610
. . .when I mourn the loss
of the Omicronian young.

163
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:44,083
We share your pain.

164
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:49,890
If we could undo the damage. . . .

165
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:53,442
It'd be great with quack-a-mole.

166
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:56,213
Stop eating our young!
And it's guacamole!

167
00:11:57,253 --> 00:12:00,290
All right. I'm putting them away.

168
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:04,571
What is it you want?

169
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:06,092
We demand. . .

170
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:09,842
. . .to eat one human for each
Omicronian that was eaten!

171
00:12:10,053 --> 00:12:12,487
Fair enough. How many is that?

172
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,088
It's 1 98 billion, sir.

173
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:19,889
Very well. You will provide us
with 1 98 billion humans.

174
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:22,283
-And small fries.
-Lure!

175
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,603
All right. Cottage cheese.

176
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:27,686
Sir?
There aren't that many human beings.

177
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:30,686
A thought:
There aren't that many humans.

178
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:33,965
We'll wait while you
shore up the numbers.

179
00:12:34,173 --> 00:12:36,733
Well, 1 98 billion babies
in a few weeks.

180
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:40,409
We'll need super-virile men
scoring 'round the clock.

181
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:44,089
I'll do my part.
Kif? Clear my schedule.

182
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:50,412
Just wipe out humanity.
Get it over with.

183
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:53,890
-It's the waiting I can't stand.
-That's stupid.

184
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:02,805
Fellow earthlings,
we've reached an agreement.

185
00:13:03,013 --> 00:13:05,527
Using the twin guns
of grace and tact. . .

186
00:13:05,773 --> 00:13:10,289
. . .I blasted our worthless enemies
with a fair compromise.

187
00:13:10,773 --> 00:13:15,164
-They won't eat everyone.
-I filled up on nuts negotiating.

188
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:18,922
Instead, they'll eat only
one human of their choice.

189
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:22,603
We'll eat the first earthling
who ate our offspring.

190
00:13:22,853 --> 00:13:27,085
Here is the culprit, as photographed
by our nanny-cam satellite.

191
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:32,403
She must be sacrificed,
but the rest of you shall be spared!

192
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:37,924
Boo! Boo!

193
00:13:49,773 --> 00:13:52,287
Tonight, the world watches
in horror. . .

194
00:13:52,493 --> 00:13:55,724
. . .as an earthling is eaten alive
on network TV.

195
00:13:55,973 --> 00:14:00,763
This scene of unimaginable carnage
is brought to you by Fishy Joe's!

196
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:03,288
Try our new Extreme Walrus Juice!

197
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:08,086
One hundred percent fresh-squeezed
walrus! Ride the walrus!

198
00:14:08,373 --> 00:14:10,887
Ladies and gentlemen!

199
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:15,052
The Omicronians!

200
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:19,684
Greetings, Earth morsels!

201
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,449
-You suck!
-Get a job!

202
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,691
I'll miss you, Leela.

203
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:27,532
You're just a carbon-based
life form. . .

204
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:31,965
. . .but I'll always think of you
as a big pile of titanium.

205
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:36,929
Bender means you're really brave,
smart, beautiful and a great friend.

206
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:39,687
Just like titanium.

207
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:45,687
What a load! I was the one trying
to save the Popplers!

208
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,613
You ate them like the fat hog you are!

209
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:51,890
And you were stepping on them
for fun!

210
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:56,771
-You should be in here!
-Someone's acting awfully aluminum.

211
00:14:57,013 --> 00:15:00,608
My sweet, I've come to save you.
I have a devious plan.

212
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:04,010
Great. Captain Moron has a plan.

213
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:06,204
Tell it to Wingus and Dingus.

214
00:15:06,453 --> 00:15:10,765
Wingus? Dingus? We're going to give
the aliens the old switcheroo.

215
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:15,889
I found a giant, hideous ape
that looks exactly like Leela.

216
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:21,842
It doesn't look anything like me!
The hair's all wrong.

217
00:15:22,093 --> 00:15:26,405
Don't worry. Kif is an expert stylist
as you can plainly see.

218
00:15:34,853 --> 00:15:40,485
This might actually work. Omicronians
have trouble telling people apart.

219
00:15:40,693 --> 00:15:43,685
True. They thought Kif
was the statesman. . .

220
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:46,925
. . .and l, a jabbering mental patient.
Right, Kif?

221
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:49,693
Please, I'm creating!

222
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:53,522
Voilà !

223
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:58,883
-That's Leela!
-I'm seeing double!

224
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:04,726
I grow hungry!
Bring on the one called Leela.

225
00:16:04,973 --> 00:16:07,533
-That comes with salad or soup.
-Salad.

226
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,008
-Ranch or vinaigrette?
-Vinaigrette.

227
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:12,483
Balsamic or raspberry?

228
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:21,649
What's going on here?

229
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:24,165
It's very strange.

230
00:16:24,373 --> 00:16:26,284
People of Earth. . . .

231
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,925
-I get it.
-I understand.

232
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:37,643
Yes, this is the one. Definitely.

233
00:16:37,853 --> 00:16:41,209
I recognize her slumping posture
and hairy knuckles.

234
00:16:51,213 --> 00:16:54,489
Would you like some human
with your salt?

235
00:16:57,253 --> 00:17:01,929
This is it. If the aliens fall for
Zapp's ploy, the Earth will be saved.

236
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:05,205
Brought to you by Fishy Joe's.
Ride the walrus.

237
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:14,003
Wait! Stop! It's a trick!
That's not Leela!

238
00:17:15,093 --> 00:17:16,924
What? I'm losing the crowd!

239
00:17:17,173 --> 00:17:22,486
It's an orangutan, one of Mother
Earth's most precious creatures.

240
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:30,924
Why'd you open your bong hole,
you smelly hippie?

241
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,648
You'd sacrifice a beautiful woman
for an attractive monkey?

242
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,367
You must have smoked some bad granola.

243
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:42,488
The one called Smelly Hippie is right!
This is a monkey!

244
00:17:42,973 --> 00:17:45,328
Yes. Definitely.

245
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:47,245
Where is the real female?

246
00:17:47,453 --> 00:17:49,921
-I'll never tell.
-Where is she?

247
00:17:50,173 --> 00:17:52,289
I'll get her for you.

248
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:57,085
This may hurt our chances of
consummating our relationship again.

249
00:17:57,293 --> 00:18:01,081
-Go consummate yourself.
-Stop talking! You're getting cold!

250
00:18:02,053 --> 00:18:04,248
Please! I just paid off my car!

251
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:06,887
-No!
-I can't look!

252
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:21,931
People of Earth, I am Jurr of the
planet Omicron Persei Eight.

253
00:18:22,173 --> 00:18:24,482
Could you lower this thing for me?

254
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,368
Now then, if Leela gets eaten,
I get eaten.

255
00:18:29,773 --> 00:18:33,812
Little one, get out of there!
I'm going to count to Blorks!

256
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:36,283
But elder one--

257
00:18:40,173 --> 00:18:43,688
Hear me out! There are many
good reasons to eat!

258
00:18:43,893 --> 00:18:48,205
Hunger, boredom, wanting to be
the world's fattest man!

259
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:51,450
But not revenge.
Are we no better than they?

260
00:18:51,653 --> 00:18:53,723
Besides, Leela's my friend.

261
00:18:53,973 --> 00:18:57,204
-She's your friend?
-Yeah, I am!

262
00:18:57,453 --> 00:19:01,366
Leela's garbled words have opened
my eyes!

263
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:09,130
Okay, that's a start.
It's very earth-friendly.

264
00:19:09,373 --> 00:19:12,683
Now everyone join hands.
Join hands, please.

265
00:19:12,893 --> 00:19:17,091
I'd like to lead you all in some
swaying. Pay attention.

266
00:19:17,453 --> 00:19:19,045
I said do it!

267
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:22,292
-Is he your friend too?
-No.

268
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:25,489
This is not happening.

269
00:19:28,813 --> 00:19:32,283
I think there was something funny
in that hippie.

270
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:36,771
Thank you, Jurr. I hope you'll always
think of me as your mom.

271
00:19:36,973 --> 00:19:40,488
When my species grows up,
we eat our moms.

272
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:45,126
People of Earth--
That hippie's starting to kick in.

273
00:19:45,373 --> 00:19:50,527
We've all learned an important lesson
today. I realize now that--

274
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:54,209
Dude, my hands are huge!

275
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:59,883
They can touch anything
but themselves.

276
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:02,482
-Oh, wait--
-Let's go.

277
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:21,284
Whoa, I feel like I'm flying.

278
00:20:26,053 --> 00:20:30,490
A toast to Leela. She showed us
it's wrong to eat certain things.

279
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:32,331
-Here!
-Let's get drunk!

280
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:36,048
-Thanks, guys. Pass the veal, please?
-Here you go.

281
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:39,086
Let me get some of that suckling pig.

282
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:41,291
Who wants dolphin?

283
00:20:41,653 --> 00:20:43,848
But dolphins are intelligent.

284
00:20:44,053 --> 00:20:47,329
No, this one blew his money
on lottery tickets.

285
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:49,451
-Good.
-Pass the blowhole.

286
00:20:49,653 --> 00:20:52,611
-Fluke, please.
-Quit hogging the bottle-nose!

287
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:56,084
Toss me the speech center
of the brain!
