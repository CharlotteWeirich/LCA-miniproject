<i>Air.</i>

<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

00:00:13,697 --> 00:00:17,775
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:29,410
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:31,250
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:33,456
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,457 --> 00:00:37,189
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,812
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

Chapter Eleven: The Great Divide

15
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:01,033
Um... aren't you forgetting the tarp?

16
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:03,174
Right... got it.

17
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:06,539
Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp on top of the tent.

18
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:08,716
You know, so we don't get rained on.

19
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:13,040
Ordinarily you'd be right, but seeing how it's the dry season, you're not.

20
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:14,892
Besides, that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket.

21
00:01:14,947 --> 00:01:16,353
But what if it does rain?

22
00:01:16,397 --> 00:01:20,394
But what if it doesn't? Then I would have put the tarp up for nothing.

23
00:01:20,464 --> 00:01:21,929
You're infuriating!

24
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:24,410
Katara, why don't you worry about gathering the firewood...

25
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:27,648
...because that kindling's looking pretty sorry.

26
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:31,174
Well if you don't like my firewood... have it!

27
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,100
Fine by me! If you're not going to do your job... urg!

28
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:37,425
Okay, I got the grub if you guys got the...

29
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:40,673
Hey, where's the campfire? And what happened to the tent?

30
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:43,703
Why don't you ask Miss Know It All? Queen of the Twigs!

31
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:50,344
Oh yeah? Well you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the... Tents!

32
00:01:50,423 --> 00:01:55,629
Okay, listen guys. Harsh words won't solve problems, action will.

33
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,571
Why don't you just switch jobs?

34
00:01:57,638 --> 00:01:58,931
- Sounds good.
- Whatever.

35
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:06,819
You see that? Settling feuds and making peace. All in a days work for the Avatar.

36
00:02:20,252 --> 00:02:26,399
Come on Momo, that's fair. Appa's got five stomachs.

37
00:02:28,354 --> 00:02:31,529
Here it is, guys, The Great Divide.

38
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:34,501
Wow! I could just stare at it forever.

39
00:02:34,578 --> 00:02:36,272
Okay. I've seen enough.

40
00:02:36,353 --> 00:02:41,639
How can you not be fascinated, Sokka? This is the largest canyon in the entire world.

41
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:45,547
Then I'm sure we'll be able to see it very clearly from the air while we fly away.

42
00:02:45,619 --> 00:02:48,769
Hey! If you're looking for the Canyon Guide, I was here first!

43
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:52,021
Ooooo... canyon guide. Sounds informative.

44
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,447
Believe me, he's more than a tour guide, he's an earthbender.

45
00:02:55,537 --> 00:02:58,587
And the only way in and out of the canyon is with his help.

46
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,002
And he's takin' my tribe across next!

47
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:02,542
Calm down, we know you're next.

48
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,524
You wouldn't be calm if the Fire Nation destroyed your home and forced you to flee.

49
00:03:06,595 --> 00:03:11,576
My whole tribe has to walk thousands of miles to the capital city of Ba Sing Se!

50
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:13,121
You're a refugee.

51
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:16,995
Humph. Tell me somethin' I don't know.

52
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,206
Is that your tribe?

53
00:03:19,307 --> 00:03:20,868
It most certainly is not.

54
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,393
That's the Zhang tribe.
A bunch of low-life thieves.

55
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:28,140
They've been the enemies of my tribe for hundred years.

56
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:33,180
Hey Zhangs! I'm savin' a spot for my tribe so don't even think of stealing it!

57
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:38,144
Where are the rest of the Gan Jin? Still tidying up their campsite?

58
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:41,254
Yes! But they sent me ahead of them to hold a spot.

59
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,698
I didn't know the canyon Guide took reservations.

60
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,561
Heh! Of course you didn't. That's the ignorance I'd expect from a messy Zhang!

61
00:03:48,643 --> 00:03:53,932
So unorganized and ill prepared for a journey.

62
00:04:02,104 --> 00:04:07,876
Sorry about the wait, youngsters. Who's ready to cross this here canyon?

63
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:10,167
Um... one of them I think.

64
00:04:10,257 --> 00:04:12,590
I was here first! My party's on their way!

65
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:15,439
I can't guide people who aren't here.

66
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,568
Guess you guys'll have to make the trip tomorrow.

67
00:04:19,815 --> 00:04:22,203
Wait! Here they come!

68
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,157
You're not seriously going to cave into these spoiled Gan Jins!

69
00:04:31,274 --> 00:04:35,591
I mean, we're refugees too! And we've got sick people that need shelter.

70
00:04:35,697 --> 00:04:37,522
I... uh... well...

71
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:40,122
We've got old people who are weary from traveling.

72
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:42,928
Sick people get priority over old people.

73
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:47,729
Maybe you Zhang's wouldn't have so many sick people if you weren't such slobs.

74
00:04:47,814 --> 00:04:52,414
If you Gan Jins weren't so clean, maybe you wouldn't live to be so old.

75
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,780
I could smell your stink a mile away.

76
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,044
Well Aang, ready to put your peace...

77
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:56,780
...making skills to the test?

78
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,084
I... don't know. A fight over chores is one thing.

79
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:02,904
These people have been feuding for hundred years.

80
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,103
Everyone, listen up! This is the Avatar! And if you give him a chance,...

81
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:13,792
...I'm sure he can come up with a compromise that will make everyone happy.

82
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:17,731
Uh... you could share the earthbender and travel together?

83
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:18,752
Absolutely not!

84
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:23,374
We'd rather be taken by the Fire Nation than travel with those stinking thieves.

85
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,962
We wouldn't travel with you pompous fools anyway!

86
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:27,737
I am not pompous!

87
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,308
Alright! Here's the deal!

88
00:05:29,393 --> 00:05:33,422
We're all going down together and Appa here will fly your sick and elderly across.

89
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:36,506
Does that seem fair?

90
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:48,865
Sorry Appa. You'll have to do this on your own.

91
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:51,348
And this feuding tribe stuff is serious business.

92
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,587
Are you sure it's a good idea getting involved in this?

93
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:57,987
To tell the truth, I'm not sure. But when have I ever been?

94
00:05:58,098 --> 00:06:02,345
He's the Avatar, Sokka. Making peace between people is his job.

95
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:05,497
His job's gonna make us cross this whole thing on foot, isn't it?

96
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:08,150
Okay, now comes the bad news.

97
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:14,784
No food allowed in the canyon. It attracts dangerous predators.

98
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,402
No food! This is ridiculous.

99
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:25,657
Aww, you babies can go a day without food. Would you rather be hungry... or dead?

100
00:06:25,746 --> 00:06:28,234
Now, we're headin' down in ten minutes.

101
00:06:28,363 --> 00:06:34,358
All food better be in your gut, or in the garbage!

102
00:06:38,512 --> 00:06:42,222
Appas's gonna take good care of you until we get there.

103
00:06:42,324 --> 00:06:47,555
See ya on the other side, buddy. Yip, yip!

104
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:01,493
Nice bending!

105
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,635
The job's much more than bending, kid. Folks want information.

106
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:12,019
Many of you are probably wondering how canyons are formed.

107
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:17,717
Experts tell us this canyon was most likely carved into the ground by Earth Spirits...

108
00:07:17,793 --> 00:07:26,652
...who were angry at local farmers for not offering them a proper sacrifice.

109
00:07:32,508 --> 00:07:40,726
Guess the spirits are still angry! Hope you all brought sacrifices.

110
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:48,713
Okay... everyone stand clear of the wall.

111
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,442
Why'd you do that?

112
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:56,647
These people are fleeing the Fire Nation, aren't they?

113
00:07:56,712 --> 00:08:02,644
I gotta make sure we can't be followed. We'll be safe now.

114
00:08:05,997 --> 00:08:08,913
We gotta help him!

115
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:16,563
Okay... now you gotta help me!

116
00:08:35,402 --> 00:08:36,671
What was that?

117
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:41,888
Canyon crawler. Oh, ugh! And there's sure to be more.

118
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:44,319
Your arms... they're broken.

119
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:48,471
Without my arms, I got no bending. In other words...

120
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:51,913
...we're trapped in this canyon.

121
00:09:00,054 --> 00:09:01,586
I thought the whole point of ditching our food...

122
00:09:01,661 --> 00:09:04,776
...was so we wouldn't have to deal with things like... canyon crawlers...

123
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:10,102
It's the Zhangs! They took food down here, even after the guide told them not to!

124
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:13,965
What! If there's anyone who can't go without food for a day,...

125
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,039
...it's you pampered Gan Jins!

126
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,644
I hope you're happy. We're stuck in the canyon with no way out.

127
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:22,148
Why don't you thank yourself, food hider!

128
00:09:22,238 --> 00:09:24,394
Look. Sticking together is the only way to...

129
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:27,385
I'm not walkin' another step with the likes of them.

130
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:30,536
Now, there's something we can agree on.

131
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:31,758
Any ideas?

132
00:09:31,853 --> 00:09:34,878
No bending. We need to get out of this canyon.

133
00:09:34,972 --> 00:09:40,461
I won't die down here! I won't become part of the food chain!

134
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,909
See? We're going to become part of the food chain because of you!

135
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:47,363
Sure. Unjustly blame the Zhangs like you always do!

136
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:48,213
Gladly!

137
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:51,602
Enough! I thought I could help you guys get along,...

138
00:09:51,681 --> 00:09:55,442
...but I guess that's not going to happen.

139
00:09:55,675 --> 00:10:00,079
We should split up. Gan Jins on this side... and Zhangs on that side.

140
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,405
We'll travel in two separate lines.

141
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:12,943
Sokka, you go with the Zhangs. And Katara, you go with the Gan Jins.

142
00:10:13,038 --> 00:10:18,468
See if you can figure out why they hate each other so much.

143
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:36,841
So, you guys aren't going to put up your tarps?

144
00:10:36,938 --> 00:10:39,075
What for? It's the dry season.

145
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:40,476
Exactly!

146
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,431
Besides, we like to use the tarp as a blanket.

147
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:47,708
Finally, someone gets it.

148
00:10:52,892 --> 00:10:54,534
You really think it'll rain?

149
00:10:54,626 --> 00:11:00,391
No, but you can never be too careful, right?

150
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,524
Would you care for some bread, Katara?

151
00:11:18,617 --> 00:11:20,835
So it was you guys who had food!

152
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:25,067
Oh come now. You really think that tribe of thieves isn't smuggling food?

153
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:30,301
Why should my people go hungry when the sneaky Zhangs are stuffing their faces?

154
00:11:30,384 --> 00:11:36,377
Well, I guess it's okay if everyone's doing it.

155
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:41,647
So, why does your tribe hate the Zhang so much?

156
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:49,799
You seem like a smart girl, Katara. I bet you would enjoy hearing some history.

157
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:55,689
The patriarch of our tribe,...

158
00:11:55,789 --> 00:12:00,764
...Jin Wei, was an earthbender warrior who was assigned an important duty,...

159
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:10,026
...transporting our sacred orb from the Great Eastern Gate to the Great Western Gate.

160
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:17,119
Taking the orb from the east to the west represents the sun's rising and setting.

161
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:21,383
It was our tribe's ancient redemption ritual...

162
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:26,504
...but as he approached the gate, Jin Wei was attacked by one of the Zhang!

163
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:32,116
A vermin, named Wei Jin, who looked at the orb with envy.

164
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:39,397
That coward, Wei Jin, knocked Jin Wei to the ground and stole our sacred orb.

165
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:48,315
Our people have never forgotten. You can never trust a Zhang.

166
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:52,200
Care for some meat?

167
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,197
Would I!?

168
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,773
I know what you must be thinking.

169
00:12:55,866 --> 00:13:00,332
We're horrible for endangering everybody by bringing food down here.

170
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:04,435
The Gan Jin think so badly of us they probably assumed we brought food in...

171
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,102
...and decided to bring food in themselves. That's why we brought food in.

172
00:13:09,196 --> 00:13:15,612
Our conflict with the Gan Jin goes back over a hundred years...

173
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,251
Our forefather, Wei Jin, was leaving the western gate of our village...

174
00:13:21,337 --> 00:13:23,751
...when he saw a figure in the distance.

175
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:29,163
It was a man of the Gan Jin tribe, Jin Wei, collapsed on the ground.

176
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:34,685
Noble Wei Jin stopped to help him. Jin Wei was transporting a sacred orb,...

177
00:13:34,774 --> 00:13:39,243
...a very powerful relic used in his tribe's redemption ritual.

178
00:13:39,313 --> 00:13:41,380
Wei Jin tried to tend to the man's wounds,...

179
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:44,683
...but Jin Wei insisted the orb was more important,...

180
00:13:44,727 --> 00:13:47,515
...and asked him to take it back to his tribe.

181
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:51,855
Kind Wei Jin promised to send help for the man as soon as he could,...

182
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:56,362
...but as Wei Jin crossed the border to return the orb into Gan Jin territory...

183
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:58,704
...he was arrested!

184
00:14:02,106 --> 00:14:05,377
Instead of thanking him for his kind and selfless deed,...

185
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:09,737
...they sentenced him to twenty long years in prison.

186
00:14:10,318 --> 00:14:13,426
We Zhang's will never forget that injustice.

187
00:14:13,526 --> 00:14:18,826
That's just terrible. You gonna finish that?

188
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,074
Sure would be nice to be around one of those campfires,...

189
00:14:22,164 --> 00:14:26,384
...telling stories and laughing. It's okay, Momo,...

190
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:33,255
...we'll be out of here soon enough and then we can eat our weight in leechy nuts!

191
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:39,733
Nah, I'll wait for the leechy nuts.

192
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,954
It's lonely, isn't it? Being impartial.

193
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:48,059
I wish I could help these people get along, but it just seems impossible.

194
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:51,007
Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem is getting out of here.

195
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:58,046
I'm not so sure the two problems are unrelated.

196
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,824
All clear! We're almost to the other side.

197
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:20,318
Katara, Sokka, will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon?

198
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:24,066
I don't think so, Aang, the Zhang's really wronged the Gan Jins.

199
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:27,130
They ambushed Jin We and stole the sacred orb.

200
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,609
What are you talking about?

201
00:15:28,702 --> 00:15:30,823
Yeh, Katara, what are you talking about?

202
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:32,822
We Jin didn't steal the orb,...

203
00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:36,610
...he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin.

204
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:39,145
Not punished enough if you ask me!

205
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:41,652
Okay! Okay! I get it! Now I need your help.

206
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:47,342
Let's get everyone together at the base of the canyon wall.

207
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,605
Please everyone! As soon as we get out of here we can eat,...

208
00:15:55,713 --> 00:15:57,164
...and then go our separate ways,...

209
00:15:57,251 --> 00:16:00,859
...but I need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff.

210
00:16:00,957 --> 00:16:05,129
Maybe the Zhang can climb the walls with their long, disgusting fingernails.

211
00:16:05,221 --> 00:16:08,159
Oh, sorry! I forgot that to the Gan Jin,...

212
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,299
...unclipped fingernails is a crime punishable by twenty years in jail!

213
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:13,823
Why you dirty thief!

214
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:17,592
You pompous fool!

215
00:16:17,818 --> 00:16:21,329
Guys! focus! How many times do I have to say it?

216
00:16:21,428 --> 00:16:25,445
Harsh words won't solve problems, action will!

217
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:27,725
Perhaps the Avatar is right.

218
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:31,427
Yes, perhaps he is.

219
00:16:32,054 --> 00:16:34,870
Harsh words will never solve our problems...

220
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,404
...action will!

221
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:47,706
To the death! And let this be the end of this rivalry!

222
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:53,706
You know, I take it back! Harsh words aren't so bad!

223
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:22,483
Is that... food? Everyone smuggled food down here!? Unbelievable!

224
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:26,631
You guys put our lives in danger because you couldn't go without a snack for a day!?

225
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:31,163
You are all... awful!

226
00:17:35,892 --> 00:17:43,825
So hungry... is that... egg custard in that tart?

227
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,945
Oh no! That's a lot of canyon crawlers!

228
00:17:54,048 --> 00:17:55,866
We barely survived one!

229
00:17:55,948 --> 00:18:01,181
They're coming back for me! They've had a taste, and they're coming back for me!

230
00:18:01,271 --> 00:18:06,864
Sokka, wait! I don't care about this stupid feud! I just want us to get out of here alive.

231
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:12,135
Me too. I only took their side because they fed me.

232
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:17,121
Everybody! Watch me! Do what I do!

233
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:47,480
Now, follow me! We're riding out of this hole!

234
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:05,564
Everyone! Get off!

235
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,470
We made it!

236
00:20:22,298 --> 00:20:25,404
I never thought a Gan Jin could get his hands dirty like that.

237
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:28,956
And I never knew you Zhang's were so reliable in a pinch.

238
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:32,976
Perhaps we're not so different after all.

239
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:39,495
Too bad we can't rewrite history. You thieves stole our sacred orb from Jin Wei!

240
00:20:39,564 --> 00:20:45,158
You tyrants unjustly imprisoned We Jin for twenty long years!

241
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:50,909
Wait a second! Jin Wei? Wei Jin? I know those guys!

242
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:53,877
Yes, yes, we're all aware of the story.

243
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:59,417
No! I mean I really knew them. I may not look it, but I'm 112 years old.

244
00:20:59,496 --> 00:21:03,669
I was there a hundred years ago on the day you're talking about...

245
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,711
There seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened.

246
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,933
First of all, Jin Wei and Wei Jin weren't enemies, they were brothers,...

247
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:15,726
...twins in fact and they were eight and most importantly,...

248
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:21,311
...they were just playing a game! The sacred orb from the legend... that was the ball.

249
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:24,353
And the eastern and western gates were the goal posts.

250
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:28,329
Jin Wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it.

251
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,149
Win Jei didn't steal the ball,...

252
00:21:30,236 --> 00:21:33,176
...he picked it up and started running it back toward the other goal.

253
00:21:33,255 --> 00:21:37,986
But he stepped out of bounds, so the official put him in the penalty box,...

254
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:42,774
...not for twenty long years, but for two short minutes.

255
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:47,439
There was no stealing and no putting anyone in prison. Just a game.

256
00:21:47,512 --> 00:21:50,351
You're saying the sacred orb was actually a sacred ball?

257
00:21:50,424 --> 00:21:52,520
Nope, just a regular ball.

258
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:54,549
What about our tribe's redemption ritual?

259
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:57,137
That's what the game was called, Redemption.

260
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:59,884
As soon as someone got the ball from one goal to the other,...

261
00:21:59,974 --> 00:22:04,168
...everyone would yell, "redemption!"

262
00:22:04,232 --> 00:22:05,061
Don't get me wrong,...

263
00:22:05,154 --> 00:22:09,457
...Wei Jin was kind of a slob and Jin Wei was a little stuffy, that much is true,...

264
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:14,051
...but they respected each others differences enough to share the same playing field.

265
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:17,348
I suppose it's time we forget the past...

266
00:22:17,401 --> 00:22:20,592
...and look to the future.

267
00:22:27,902 --> 00:22:31,455
Good to see ya, boy! Did you miss me?

268
00:22:31,526 --> 00:22:33,998
I cannot thank you enough, Avatar.

269
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:38,461
Well, you know, I try.

270
00:22:38,547 --> 00:22:44,460
Let us travel to the Earth Kingdom capital as one tribe!

271
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:48,686
I'm goin' too! I'm sick of this place!

272
00:22:48,783 --> 00:22:51,118
That's some luck you knew Jin Wei and Wei Jin.

273
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:54,585
You could call it luck. Or, you could call it... lying!

274
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:55,433
What!?

275
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:57,176
I made the whole thing up.

276
00:22:57,266 --> 00:23:01,136
You did not! That is so wrong.

277
00:23:01,221 --> 00:23:06,701
Now where's that custard tart? I'm starving!

278
00:23:07,438 --> 00:23:10,614
