1
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:09,876
Guard:
Line them up for the Warden!

2
00:02:18,761 --> 00:02:24,561
Dad. Excuse me, coming through.
The Warden wants me over there, sorry.

3
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:29,226
Warden:
Welcome to The Boiling Rock.

4
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:33,318
I'm sure you've all heard the
horrible rumors about our little island.

5
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:37,172
Well I just want to tell you
that they don't have to be true.

6
00:02:37,294 --> 00:02:43,794
As long as you do everything I say.
Look me in the eye when I'm talking to you.

7
00:02:44,507 --> 00:02:45,407
Hakoda: No.

8
00:02:45,488 --> 00:02:50,488
Oh, you'd rather look at my shoes?
Then take a look!

9
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:59,123
I know exactly who you are,
Hakoda of the Water Tribe. So strong willed.

10
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:04,954
But don't worry, we'll get rid
of that in time. Now look me in the eye.

11
00:03:08,983 --> 00:03:15,283
See? Isn't that better. You will all
do as I say or pay the price. You will all...

12
00:03:18,654 --> 00:03:20,154
Are you okay, Sir?

13
00:03:20,444 --> 00:03:23,744
I'm fine! Get these
prisoners out of my sight!

14
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:40,731
Thank goodness you're okay.

15
00:03:41,102 --> 00:03:46,102
If you take one step closer
you'll see just how okay I am.

16
00:03:46,654 --> 00:03:47,954
Dad, it's me.

17
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:51,976
Sokka, my son.

18
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:58,101
You know Sokka, you should be
more careful with that guard outfit on.

19
00:03:58,374 --> 00:04:02,274
- I almost punched you in the gut.
- Yeah, I ran into that problem earlier.

20
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:10,624
Are you comfortable
Chit Sang?

21
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:15,182
If you're trying to get me to talk,
forget it. I'm not a squealer.

22
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:19,566
Chit Sang, I only asked
you if you were comfortable.

23
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:22,975
Well, yeah. Actually,
I am pretty comfortable.

24
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,850
- Are you still comfortable?
- No.

25
00:04:29,224 --> 00:04:34,024
I know you and your cronies are not smart
enough to come up with that little escape plan.

26
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:37,204
So you're gonna tell me.
Who is?

27
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:53,901
So where's Bato? Where's
everyone else from the invasion?

28
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,400
The others are being held
at a prison near the Fire Nation palace.

29
00:04:57,403 --> 00:04:59,903
They singled me out as
their leader and sent me here.

30
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:06,103
But before I left I met some young women
who said they knew you. The Yoshinama Fighters?

31
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,439
You mean the Kyoshi Warriors?

32
00:05:08,503 --> 00:05:09,503
That's right.

33
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:12,547
Their leader Suki is here
and she's gonna escape with us.

34
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,904
Good, we'll need
all the help we can get.

35
00:05:14,972 --> 00:05:16,672
And you know Prince Zuko?

36
00:05:16,703 --> 00:05:20,503
The son of the Firelord?
I don't know him, but I knew of him.

37
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:22,104
Well, he's here too.

38
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:23,837
Sounds like a major problem.

39
00:05:24,227 --> 00:05:26,427
Actually,
he's on our side now.

40
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,710
I know, I had the same reaction.
After all he has done, it was hard to trust him.

41
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:36,033
But he's really proven himself and
I never would have found you without his help.

42
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:39,993
So, do you have a plan?

43
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:43,829
We had one but some of the other
prisoners got involved and ruined it.

44
00:05:44,238 --> 00:05:46,538
I don't know if there's
another way off this island.

45
00:05:46,748 --> 00:05:51,848
Sokka, there's no prison in the World
that can hold two Water Tribe geniuses.

46
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,518
Then we'd better find two.

47
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:09,331
Zuko, are you there?

48
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:10,909
I'm here.

49
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,250
I just got done talking to my Dad.
We came up with an escape plan together.

50
00:06:15,254 --> 00:06:17,254
Male Guard:
What are you doing here?

51
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:21,627
I was just telling this
dirty lowlife what I think of him!

52
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,720
Well, you'll have to do
that later, he's coming with us.

53
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:26,497
Why?

54
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,570
Female Guard: Because we have
orders straight from the Warden. That's why.

55
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:32,753
Could I just get 10 more
seconds to rough him up a bit?

56
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,090
Fine, ten seconds.

57
00:06:37,942 --> 00:06:39,942
Sokka:
Take that! And this!

58
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:41,605
Newbie.

59
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:48,546
We have a new plan but
it's gonna need a big distraction.

60
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:50,207
Be in the yard in one hour.

61
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:54,792
Alright,
that's enough.

62
00:06:58,095 --> 00:07:00,895
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?

63
00:07:04,352 --> 00:07:05,852
I didn't do anything wrong.

64
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,495
Mai: Come on Zuko.
We all know that's a lie.

65
00:07:10,007 --> 00:07:11,007
Mai.

66
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:18,738
How is he?

67
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:20,622
I think he's ready to talk.

68
00:07:26,305 --> 00:07:29,805
Have you had enough
time to think about what I asked?

69
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:32,271
- Yes.
- And?

70
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:37,046
You're right. There was another
person involved in the escape plan.

71
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:38,077
Who?

72
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:42,151
It's a guy who's disguised like a
prison guard, only he's not a prison guard.

73
00:07:42,186 --> 00:07:45,286
He's the mastermind.
He came up with the plan.

74
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,700
How did you know I was here?

75
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,747
Because I know you so well.

76
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:04,979
But... how?

77
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:12,176
The Warden's my Uncle you idiot.
The truth is, I guess I don't know you.

78
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:17,325
All I get is a letter. You could have at least
looked me in the eye when you ripped out my heart.

79
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,263
- I didn't mean to...
- You didn't mean to?

80
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:26,208
Dear Mai, I'm sorry that
you have to find out this way, but I'm leaving.

81
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:30,218
Stop! This isn't about you.
This is about the Fire Nation.

82
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:33,622
Thanks Zuko.
That makes me feel all better.

83
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:40,586
Mai, I never wanted to hurt you.
But I have to do this to save my country.

84
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:43,634
Save it?
You're betraying your country.

85
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,590
That's not how I see it.

86
00:08:55,007 --> 00:08:57,007
Sokka,
what's going on?

87
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,710
I don't have much time. If I'm seen with
you the guards might think something's up.

88
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:05,552
- I just talked to my Dad.
- That's great.

89
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:08,781
Yeah and we're escaping today.
On the gondola.

90
00:09:09,058 --> 00:09:09,958
What?

91
00:09:10,025 --> 00:09:12,225
My dad and I came up
with a plan together.

92
00:09:12,228 --> 00:09:16,628
We're gonna commandeer the gondola and we're
gonna take a hostage with us so they won't cut the lines.

93
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:20,424
We'll never make it onto the gondola.
There's too many guards.

94
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,793
My dad already thought of that.
He said we'll need a distraction.

95
00:09:24,102 --> 00:09:26,302
That's why we're
gonna start a prison riot.

96
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,860
Okay. Let's say by some miracle this
all works and we make it on the gondola.

97
00:09:31,913 --> 00:09:35,413
The Warden will still just cut
the lines, even if we have a captive.

98
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:38,139
Not if the Warden is the captive.

99
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,340
I have to go.
I'll find you before we start the riot.

100
00:09:47,613 --> 00:09:49,913
Male Guard: Hey you!
The Warden wants to see you.

101
00:09:50,151 --> 00:09:52,751
- Why?
- I don't know. I didn't ask.

102
00:09:52,904 --> 00:09:56,004
Maybe I could schedule another
time with him? How's tomorrow?

103
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,304
He wants to see you,
now.

104
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,540
Warden:
Put him in the line up.

105
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:14,216
One of you is an imposter
who thought he could fool me.

106
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:19,245
But now that person is
going to be in a lot of trouble.

107
00:10:20,483 --> 00:10:21,683
Who is it?

108
00:10:28,142 --> 00:10:30,642
Chit Sang: That's him, Warden.
He's the imposter.

109
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:39,074
Bully Guard: What?! I am not.
He's lying! He's a liar!

110
00:10:46,903 --> 00:10:49,903
Bully Guard: I'm telling you,
it wasn't me.

111
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:53,663
Save your breath. I know
you've been working together.

112
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:58,854
You threw Chit Sang in the very cooler
they used to escape. It was all part of your plan.

113
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:00,941
That was just a coincidence.

114
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:03,801
Guard:
Sir, there's someone to see you.

115
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:05,576
Who told you to interrupt me!

116
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:08,113
Azula: I did.

117
00:11:09,788 --> 00:11:11,088
Warden: Princess Azula.

118
00:11:11,398 --> 00:11:18,598
Uh, it is an honor to welcome you to the Fire Nation's
most exemplary prison. I didn't realize you were coming.

119
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:19,773
Who is this?

120
00:11:20,502 --> 00:11:24,202
He's a guard who was involved
in a recent and feeble escape attempt.

121
00:11:24,554 --> 00:11:27,154
- It wasn't me.
- Quiet you.

122
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:30,201
You're wasting your time.
That's not one of them.

123
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:34,335
- How do you know?
- Because I'm a people person.

124
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:43,473
Sokka: Hey, I just got orders.
Let the prisoners out into the yard.

125
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:45,608
Guard: But we’re in
the middle of lockdown.

126
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:48,433
Oh, okay. I'll just go tell
the Warden you said that.

127
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,120
I'm sure he'll be glad to hear about you
undermining his authority. What's your name again?

128
00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:57,119
Wait. Don't tell the Warden,
I… I'm just a little confused.

129
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:02,309
Hey, I'm confused too. But the
Warden's in a bad mood and irrational.

130
00:12:02,465 --> 00:12:06,665
So if you ask me, it's best not to
question it and just do what he says.

131
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:10,501
Yeah, you're right.
We're letting them out.

132
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,530
This is it.
We have to start a riot.

133
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,618
Okay,
but how do we do that?

134
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:39,538
I'll show you.

135
00:12:42,835 --> 00:12:46,635
Prisoner: Hey, why did you do that for?
That hurt my feelings.

136
00:12:46,836 --> 00:12:48,036
Aren't you mad at me?

137
00:12:48,188 --> 00:12:52,688
Uhh, well normally I would be,
but I've been working to control my anger.

138
00:12:53,674 --> 00:12:54,874
This isn't working.

139
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:58,342
Chit Sang: Hey you.
You're lucky I didn't rat you out.

140
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,729
But my generosity
comes with a price.

141
00:13:01,138 --> 00:13:04,238
I know you're planning
another escape attempt and I want in.

142
00:13:05,123 --> 00:13:07,523
Actually,
we're trying to escape right now.

143
00:13:07,532 --> 00:13:11,832
But we need a riot. You wouldn't
happen to know how to start one would you?

144
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:15,025
A prison riot?
Please.

145
00:13:18,457 --> 00:13:21,057
Hey! Riot!

146
00:13:26,434 --> 00:13:27,434
Impressive.

147
00:13:28,936 --> 00:13:31,736
Prisoner: Forget about
controlling my anger. Let's riot!

148
00:13:39,594 --> 00:13:44,094
Warden: Who let these prisoners
into the yard? This is supposed to be a lockdown!

149
00:13:49,397 --> 00:13:51,897
Guard: Ma'am, there's
a riot going on. I'm here to protect you.

150
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,610
I don't need any protection.

151
00:13:53,795 --> 00:13:55,895
Hah, believe me.
She doesn't.

152
00:13:56,017 --> 00:13:59,517
I'm sorry but I'm under direct orders
from your Uncle to make sure nothing happens.

153
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:02,405
Get off of me!

154
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:22,967
Zuko, good. We're all here. Now all we need
to do is grab the Warden and get to the gondolas.

155
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,562
And how do we do that?

156
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:26,163
I'm not sure.

157
00:14:26,628 --> 00:14:28,828
Argh, I thought
you thought this through.

158
00:14:29,062 --> 00:14:32,062
I thought you told me it's okay
not to think everything through!

159
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:35,239
Maybe not everything.
But this is kind of important.

160
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:39,638
Chit Sang: Hey, uhh, fellas.
I think your girlfriend's taking care of it.

161
00:15:09,238 --> 00:15:10,806
You wouldn't dare.

162
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:17,241
Sorry Warden,
you're my prisoner now.

163
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:21,706
We've got the Warden,
now let's get out of here.

164
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:25,207
- That's some girl.
- Tell me about it.

165
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,630
We're almost there.

166
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,840
Back off,
we've got the Warden.

167
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,100
Let's go.

168
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:03,023
Everyone in.

169
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:35,701
What are you doing?

170
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,759
 I'm making it
so they can't stop us.

171
00:16:38,235 --> 00:16:39,435
Way to think ahead.

172
00:16:39,913 --> 00:16:40,913
We're on our way.

173
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,866
Wait.
Who's that?

174
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:47,069
Zuko: That's a problem.
It's my sister and her friend.

175
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:12,867
This is a rematch
I've been waiting for.

176
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,260
Me too.

177
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:24,389
Guard #1:
There's the Warden. I see him!

178
00:18:28,032 --> 00:18:29,032
Cut the line!

179
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,309
Guard #2:
He wants us to cut the line.

180
00:18:31,697 --> 00:18:34,297
Guard #3: But if we cut the line,
there's no way he'll survive.

181
00:18:34,751 --> 00:18:36,251
Guard #1: He knows that.

182
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,116
Ty Lee:
They're about to cut the line!

183
00:19:15,032 --> 00:19:17,032
Then it's time to leave.

184
00:19:20,144 --> 00:19:21,144
Goodbye Zuko.

185
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:37,779
They're cutting the line.
The gondola's about to go!

186
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,780
Hakoda:
I hope this thing floats.

187
00:19:51,098 --> 00:19:52,498
Guard:
What are you doing?!

188
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,280
Saving the jerk who dumped me.

189
00:20:21,403 --> 00:20:22,603
Who is that?

190
00:20:28,156 --> 00:20:29,156
It's Mai.

191
00:20:29,502 --> 00:20:31,002
What is she doing?

192
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,670
Sorry Warden,
your record is officially broken.

193
00:20:57,096 --> 00:20:59,696
Well, we made it out.
Now what?

194
00:21:01,784 --> 00:21:03,184
Zuko, what are you doing?

195
00:21:03,411 --> 00:21:05,111
My sister was on that island.

196
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:08,771
Yeah and she's probably
right behind us. So let's not stop.

197
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:11,179
What I mean is she
must have come here somehow.

198
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,948
There.
That's our way out of here.

199
00:21:24,707 --> 00:21:25,907
Azula: Leave us alone.

200
00:21:30,893 --> 00:21:32,993
I never expected this from you.

201
00:21:36,771 --> 00:21:42,771
The thing I don't understand is why?
Why would you do it? You know the consequences.

202
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,903
I guess you just don't know
people as well as you think you do.

203
00:21:48,624 --> 00:21:53,424
You miscalculated.
I love Zuko more than I fear you.

204
00:21:53,722 --> 00:21:56,722
No, you miscalculated!
You should have feared me more!

205
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,236
Come on,
let's get out of here!

206
00:22:14,908 --> 00:22:16,308
You’re both fools.

207
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,799
What shall we do with them,
princess?

208
00:22:21,231 --> 00:22:26,031
Put them somewhere I'll never have
to see their faces again. And let them rot.

209
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,440
Katara: What are you doing in this thing?
What happened to the war balloon?

210
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:41,432
- It kind of got destroyed.
- Sounds like a crazy fishing trip.

211
00:22:41,634 --> 00:22:43,534
Did you at least
get some good meat?

212
00:22:43,634 --> 00:22:49,334
I did. The best meat of all.
The meat of friendship and fatherhood.

213
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,380
Chit Sang:
I'm new. What's up everybody?

214
00:22:55,532 --> 00:22:56,632
Dad.

215
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,060
Hi, Katara.

216
00:23:03,662 --> 00:23:07,662
How are you here?
What is going on? Where did you go?

217
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,050
We…
kind of went to a Fire Nation prison.

218
00:23:16,107 --> 00:23:19,107
Seriously,
you guys didn't find any meat?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
