aang: ladies and gentlemen.

327
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,859
the flamey-os!

328
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,463
yeah, this ought to get
everybody moving.

329
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:14,434
now what
do we do?

330
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,503
this is when you start dancing.

331
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:20,107
i don't think
my parents want me
dancing in a cave.

332
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:24,144
yeah, what if someone
finds out?

333
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,045
oh, boy.

334
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,180
listen, guys...

335
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,582
dancing isn't something
you think about.

336
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:30,317
it's a form of self-expression

337
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,553
that no one can ever
take away from you.

338
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:36,523
maybe it was different
in the colonies, kuzon,
but we don't do that here.

339
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:37,691
sure you do.

340
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,860
you have for generations.

341
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,996
it just so happens
that i know several classic
fire nation dances.

342
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,932
a hundred years o

343
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:46,400
this was known as
"the phoenix flight."

344
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,735
students: ooh... wow.

345
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:52,806
and this was
the "camelephant strut".

346
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:56,844
[giggling]

347
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:00,280
[cheering and applause]

348
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,684
who knew twinkle toes
could dance?

349
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:05,185
[cheering continues]

350
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:09,256
i brought you some
komodo-chicken.

351
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:11,024
i know you don't care for it

352
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,393
but i figure
it beats prison food.

353
00:18:13,494 --> 00:18:14,495
i admit it.

354
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,964
i have everything
i always wanted

355
00:18:17,064 --> 00:18:19,366
but it's not at all how
i thought it would be.

356
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,935
the truth is

357
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:24,071
i need your advice.

358
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:27,241
i think the avatar
is still alive.

359
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:29,209
i know he's out there.

360
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,979
i'm losing my mind.

361
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,349
please, uncle, i'm so confused,
i need your help.

362
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:38,852
forget it.

363
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,087
i'll solve this myself.

364
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:42,289
waste away in here
for all i care.

365
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:48,862
[door creaks shut]

366
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:56,036
[dance music continues]

367
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:59,106
[cheering and applause]

368
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,811
and this is how they do it in
the ballrooms of ba sing se.

369
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,819
wow, they look pretty
good together.

370
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,588
eh, if that's what you like.

371
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:17,691
aang: yeah, that's it.

372
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,561
that's the sound of happy feet.

373
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,333
all right, go with that.

374
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,335
everybody, freestyle.

375
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,054
i don't know, aang.

376
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:49,223
these shoes aren't
really right for dancing

377
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:51,425
and i'm not sure
that i know how to...

378
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:52,493
take my hand.

379
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:54,761
ok.

380
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:17,151
aang, everyone's watching.

381
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:18,385
don't worry about them.

382
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:21,255
it's just you and me right now.

383
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:47,714
[students gasp]

384
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:49,483
student: wow.

385
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,661
[music ends]
[cheering and applause]

386
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,464
[faint cheering]

387
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:07,334
<i>it is a dancing party.</i>

388
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,570
you did the right thing by
telling me, hide.

389
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,405
anytime,
headmaster, sir.

390
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,842
this is incredible.

391
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:17,277
it's like my inhibitions
just disappear.

392
00:21:22,316 --> 00:21:25,352
ok, they're back again.

393
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:26,453
headmaster: he's
the one we want.

394
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:29,590
the boy with the headband.

395
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,624
uh-oh.

396
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:37,197
guard: got ya.

397
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,565
looking for me?

398
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,702
that's not the one.

399
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:43,203
he's here somewhere.

400
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:44,605
don't let him leave the cave.

401
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,444
yes?

402
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:57,184
hi there.
how we doing?

403
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:05,726
looking for someone?

404
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:08,729
who are you
looking for?

405
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,097
do you need something?

406
00:22:10,197 --> 00:22:11,198
over here.

407
00:22:24,878 --> 00:22:27,614
stop that.

408
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:29,716
stop that.

409
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:33,654
we're safe, sokka.

410
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:35,289
you can take off
the moustache, now.

411
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:37,090
oh, no, i can't.

412
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:39,760
it's permanently
glued to my skin.

413
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,062
way to go, dancy pants.

414
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:44,665
i think you really
did help those kids.

415
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:46,066
you taught them to be free.

416
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,100
i don't know.

417
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,069
it was just
a dance party, that's all.

418
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:51,872
well, that was some
dance party, aang.

419
00:22:51,972 --> 00:22:53,307
mwah.

420
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,076

you're sure
you weren't followed?

425
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,863
zuko: i've heard about you.

426
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:18,098
they say you're good
at what you do

427
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:20,767
and even better
at keeping secrets.

428
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:23,070
the avatar's alive.

429
