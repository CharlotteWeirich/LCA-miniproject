1
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:10,565
Ba-bum.

00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:13,026
[croaks]

[dogs growling]

5
00:00:20,116 --> 00:00:22,097
We'll find Callum and Ezran

6
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:26,196
wherever we find that vile,
bloodthirsty elven assassin.

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,844
[Soren] All right, so what else
do we need for this spell?

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,874
All we have to do now is climb to the top
of the tallest mountain in Katolis.

9
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:36,969
Nothing can cut this stupid binding!

10
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:40,547
It will just get tighter and tighter
until I lose my hand.

11
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:44,842
- It's a Primal Stone.
- Wow! What's inside?

12
00:00:44,927 --> 00:00:50,047
[Claudia] It's a storm. A real storm.
Captured from the top of Mount Kalik.

13
00:00:50,605 --> 00:00:54,055
- [Ellis] I can't believe you're a mage.
- [Callum] The truth is, it's not me.

14
00:00:54,123 --> 00:00:57,180
All the magic, all the power,
all the confidence...

15
00:00:57,372 --> 00:00:59,852
it's just because of this amazing thing.

16
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:01,268
A Primal Stone.

17
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,521
That's a dragon egg, isn't it?

18
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:09,631
- I'm afraid it's dying.
- No. There has to be something you can do.

19
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:12,712
There was a miracle that happened
a few years ago,

20
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,327
but it happened on the Cursed Caldera.

21
00:01:15,573 --> 00:01:17,703
[Callum] We have to find
this miracle healer.

22
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:21,123
[Ezran] I have really bad news.
I don't know how to tell you.

23
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:24,311
Even if we make it to the rim,
it doesn't matter.

24
00:01:24,482 --> 00:01:26,224
There is no miracle healer.

25
00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:30,408

29
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:14,686
There is no miracle healer. I'm sorry.

30
00:02:14,773 --> 00:02:16,521
Stop being mysterious.

31
00:02:16,608 --> 00:02:20,111
If you're gonna make a claim like that,
you owe everyone an explanation.

32
00:02:20,198 --> 00:02:22,151
Okay. Ava told me...

33
00:02:22,238 --> 00:02:23,825
Ugh, here we go!

34
00:02:23,912 --> 00:02:25,280
No, it's true!

35
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:26,953
I can understand animals.

36
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,616
Well, did you ask Bait?

37
00:02:28,703 --> 00:02:30,577
- He might disagree.
- [croaks]

38
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:33,958
Or maybe we can find an opinionated
squirrel around here somewhere.

39
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:36,544
I knew you wouldn't listen to me.

40
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:37,667
[sighs]

41
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:39,841
[Rayla] Ezran, I'm listening to you.

42
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:42,633
But it is pretty hard to believe.

43
00:02:45,887 --> 00:02:47,594
I've always been different.

44
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:50,352
It's hard for me
to make friends with other kids.

45
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:53,308
I just feel like I don't fit in.

46
00:02:53,395 --> 00:02:56,978
That's okay. Fitting in is boring anyway.

47
00:02:57,065 --> 00:02:58,193
But with animals?

48
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,608
- Somehow, I have this connection.
- [Bait croaks]

49
00:03:01,695 --> 00:03:05,740
And a few years ago, I realized
I could understand what they were saying.

50
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,079
Can you believe this?

51
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,617
Why would he lie?

52
00:03:10,704 --> 00:03:13,244
Because he's a kid? Because it's fun?

53
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:15,418
Because he's afraid to go up the mountain?

54
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:18,666
- I'm not afraid!
- Come on, Ez, tell the truth.

55
00:03:18,753 --> 00:03:20,965
The first time he did this,
I asked him to prove it,

56
00:03:21,052 --> 00:03:23,338
so Ezran said that
a group of raccoons had told him

57
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:25,553
there was a treasure hidden
behind a waterfall.

58
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,723
But when I went through the waterfall,
did I find a treasure?

59
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,559
- No.
- But did my underwear get soaked?

60
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:34,185
- Yes.
- Case closed.

61
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,231
The raccoons were being mischievous.

62
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,020
I have since learned
you cannot trust raccoons.

63
00:03:39,107 --> 00:03:42,487
This is ridiculous!
See, this is why you can't make friends.

64
00:03:42,574 --> 00:03:44,692
Callum! Back off.

65
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:46,574
Do you believe me, Rayla?

66
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:49,617
[sighs] Does it matter?

67
00:03:50,535 --> 00:03:52,283
I believe you, Ez.

68
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,334
But I also know
the miracle healer is real.

69
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:58,790
Because I have my Ava!

70
00:03:58,877 --> 00:04:02,004
We're moving on.
We need to get to the rim.

71
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:09,258
- [horse snorts]
- [Claudia] Mount Kalik.

72
00:04:09,345 --> 00:04:11,803
The tallest mountain in Katolis.

73
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,849
[Soren] You might say it's...

74
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:15,643
the Ka-tallest.

75
00:04:15,977 --> 00:04:17,979
[laughing]

76
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:23,361
That is the funniest joke
I've heard in my entire life.

77
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:25,530
You are a genius.

78
00:04:25,617 --> 00:04:28,322
- Really?
- Why not?

79
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:31,906
Hey... what's this?

80
00:04:31,993 --> 00:04:33,324
I don't know, what?

81
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:35,874
[Claudia] The Ka-shortest mountain!

82
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:37,916
[laughing]

83
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:43,337
So, now I'm not even sure
you got the original joke.

84
00:04:46,758 --> 00:04:48,386
Look, just to double check...

85
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:51,890
you do have everything you need
for your weird spell, right?

86
00:04:51,977 --> 00:04:53,679
- Yeah, of course.
- Great.

87
00:04:53,747 --> 00:04:56,452
I... I just don't want to get
all the way to the top of the mountain

88
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,484
and have you suddenly remember
you still need a...

89
00:04:58,552 --> 00:05:00,065
a wasp butt or something.

90
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,918
[scoffs] Wasp butts are useless.

91
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:05,070
But actually,
there are a lot of interesting things

92
00:05:05,157 --> 00:05:06,821
you can do with a wasp thorax...

93
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:10,948
You know what?
Could not be less interested.

94
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:13,409
[Claudia chuckles]

95
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:25,254
Huh! The higher we walk up this caldera,
the brighter the Moon Rune glows.

96
00:05:25,922 --> 00:05:27,175
[Rayla] Here's a theory.

97
00:05:27,262 --> 00:05:29,886
The higher we walk,
the closer we are to...

98
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:31,308
the moon.

99
00:05:32,262 --> 00:05:35,431
[Callum] I don't know.
Something seems different this time.

100
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,684
- [disembodied voices moaning]
- [Ava whimpers]

101
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,767
Did anyone else hear that?

102
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:43,274
[Rayla] Yup! Ignoring it! Keep moving.

103
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,354
[moaning continues]

104
00:05:45,441 --> 00:05:47,607
[Ezran] Maybe we should
find out what it is?

105
00:05:47,694 --> 00:05:50,526
[Rayla] I'm going to share
an old elven proverb with you.

106
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:53,451
When traveling up a mountain
trying to save a dying dragon egg

107
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:55,203
and you hear a spooky sound...

108
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,078
just keep walking.

109
00:05:57,871 --> 00:05:59,541
[Callum] Wow, that's really specific.

110
00:05:59,628 --> 00:06:02,917
- [moaning continues]
- [Bait croaks nervously]

111
00:06:04,168 --> 00:06:05,795
What if someone needs help?

112
00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:16,180
Ez, you have a good heart.

113
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:20,726
It's super annoying.

114
00:06:21,102 --> 00:06:22,812
[Rayla sighs]

115
00:06:23,438 --> 00:06:26,985
Fine, but we shouldn't all go up there.
I'll check it out.

116
00:06:27,072 --> 00:06:30,444
The rest of you stay here
and keep the egg safe.

117
00:06:38,036 --> 00:06:40,371
[moaning continues]

118
00:06:59,557 --> 00:07:02,020
[disembodied voice] Turn back!

119
00:07:02,107 --> 00:07:04,267
Hello? Someone in there?

120
00:07:04,354 --> 00:07:07,648
[disembodied voice] Before it gets you,
too.

121
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,154
I'm not leaving you. Don't worry.
Just hang on, I'm going to help.

122
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,788
[gasps]

123
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:28,666
- Did you find someone?
- No.

124
00:07:28,753 --> 00:07:31,672
There was no one there.
We have to get moving.

125
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:36,554
Are you okay? You saw something.

126
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:38,092
[Rayla sighs]

127
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:40,344
It was barely alive.

128
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:44,435
Crumbled to dust right before my eyes.
It was horrible, Callum.

129
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:03,117
[screams]

130
00:08:03,204 --> 00:08:05,750
- [Callum] Ez, what's wrong?
- I...

131
00:08:05,837 --> 00:08:08,709
I saw something. A face in the dark.

132
00:08:15,883 --> 00:08:19,347
Something's watching us.
If you guys want to turn back...

133
00:08:19,434 --> 00:08:21,886
No! There's no turning back.

134
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:24,519
We have to keep going, no matter what.

135
00:08:24,606 --> 00:08:27,102
The egg doesn't have much time.

136
00:08:45,747 --> 00:08:48,958
- [Rayla] Hmm.
- Can't you just cut through it?

137
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,127
Probably better if we can go around.

138

[Ava sniffing]

139
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,303
- [Ava whimpers]
- I don't think there is an "around."

140
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,261
We need to punch through.

141
00:09:00,762 --> 00:09:01,929
[sighs]

142
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,897
All right. Let's find out what made this.

143
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:18,320
[Rayla] Be careful.

144
00:09:18,654 --> 00:09:20,906
Do not touch those webs!

Ahh! Uh, did I get it? Where'd it go?

00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:02,617
[exclaiming] I feel like it's in my hair!

152

Really? It's a two-ton magical spider.

153
00:10:05,576 --> 00:10:07,745
You'd know if it was in your hair.

[all panting]

160
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:38,317
[screeching]

161
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,572
How are we gonna get past that thing?

162
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:43,986
Even if we manage to get past,

163
00:10:44,073 --> 00:10:47,865
one misstep and we're caught
in one of those crazy webs.

164
00:10:47,952 --> 00:10:52,998
And trust me, you don't want to know
what happens if you get caught in a web.

165
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:56,585
There has to be a way.
We have to get through.

166
00:10:57,253 --> 00:10:58,754
[screeching loudly]

167
00:10:59,547 --> 00:11:00,633
Wait a second.

168
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,758
[chittering loudly]

169
00:11:04,677 --> 00:11:07,140
- Something's not right...
- [chittering continues]

170
00:11:07,227 --> 00:11:09,264
in a good way, this time!

171
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,228
[Soren] I know it's late...

172
00:11:12,315 --> 00:11:17,147
but there's something so invigorating
about climbing a mountain at midnight!

173
00:11:17,481 --> 00:11:20,481
The moonlight. Ah, the clouds.

174
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:24,363
Oh, that fresh night air...
[inhales deeply]

175
00:11:24,822 --> 00:11:27,196
[coughing]

176
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:30,204
Ahh! Claudia, I think your horse just...

177
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,746
Wasn't the horse.

178
00:11:34,498 --> 00:11:38,168
I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm disgusted...

179
00:11:38,586 --> 00:11:40,462
and a little impressed.

180
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,507
[loud chittering]

181
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:45,339
What should we do?

182
00:11:45,426 --> 00:11:48,639
We could turn back and try to find
another way up the caldera.

183
00:11:48,726 --> 00:11:52,012
[Ezran laughs] No, it's gonna be okay.

184
00:11:52,099 --> 00:11:53,931
We can just walk right past it.

185
00:11:54,018 --> 00:11:55,599
What are you talking about?

186
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:57,273
It's not real! I'm sure of it.

187
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,062
That doesn't make any sense.

188
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:03,190
Exactly!
All those crazy chitters and screams...

189
00:12:03,277 --> 00:12:04,780
that's not how spiders talk.

190
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:06,989
Ezran, you've lost your mind.

191
00:12:07,114 --> 00:12:09,450
- I'm going out there to prove it.
- Don't!

192
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:13,409
Ezran, no!

193
00:12:13,496 --> 00:12:15,581
[loud chittering]

194
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,960
[screeching loudly]

195
00:12:21,837 --> 00:12:24,381
[Ezran yelling]

196
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:30,679
[screeching loudly]

197
00:12:32,306 --> 00:12:33,888
[Ezran yelling]

198
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:36,977
[laughs] It's fun. Try screaming at him.

199
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:42,941
[screeching loudly]

200
00:12:44,151 --> 00:12:46,570
See? It won't do anything.

201
00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:50,321
You're right.

202
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:52,531
[loudly] Ez is right!

203
00:12:52,618 --> 00:12:57,498
Let's see if we can get it to turn around
and show us its creepy glow face.

204
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,837
[laughing]

205
00:13:03,587 --> 00:13:05,883
Ezran, I owe you an apology.

206
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,505
Well, at least one.

207
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:10,554
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

208
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:13,391
I promise, I won't ever doubt you again.

209
00:13:13,478 --> 00:13:15,596
- If you really mean it...
- I do.

210
00:13:15,683 --> 00:13:17,810
Then you have to do the thing.

211
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:20,021
Here? Now?

212
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,483
[inhales deeply]

213
00:13:30,031 --> 00:13:33,327
[laughing] Callum's famous jerkface dance!

214
00:13:33,414 --> 00:13:36,078
- [laughing]
- [screeching]

215
00:13:47,798 --> 00:13:51,715
So, if it's fake... what's it doing here?

216
00:13:51,802 --> 00:13:55,599
Cheering for the jerkface dance, I think.
It wants more.

217
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:57,641
Knees higher! Knees higher!

218
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,072
[screeching excitedly]

219
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:18,620
This is it!

220
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:23,625
We hid in that tree
when the miracle healer found us!

221
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:27,171
- Remember this place, girl?
- [Ava barking]

222
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,718
[Callum] So, now what? Do we just...

223
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:34,221
[loudly] Uh, Miracle Healer?
Hello! We're here!

224
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:38,140
I don't know. I just showed up,
then she showed up.

225
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:40,684
Yeah, I don't see why that shouldn't work.

226
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:49,026
[Rayla] Actually, I think it is working.

227
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,658
[bird screeching]

228
00:15:17,638 --> 00:15:18,889
Oh, no!

229
00:15:20,725 --> 00:15:22,853
Ez was right about everything.

230
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,690
That's no miracle healer. She's a fake.

231
00:15:25,777 --> 00:15:28,109
[Callum] What? How do you know?

232
00:15:28,196 --> 00:15:30,945
She's a moon mage, an illusionist.

233
00:15:31,032 --> 00:15:33,072
She can't heal anything.

234
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:36,111
It's true. I am no healer.

235
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:40,240
I am Lujanne. Guardian of the Moon Nexus.

236
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:43,661
Ugh, I'm such an idiot,
I should have figured it out.

237
00:15:43,748 --> 00:15:47,294
None of those monsters were real,
they were all illusions.

238
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:52,464
Yes. They were just to scare you.
That's how I protect the Nexus.

239
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:55,089
But... I don't understand.

240
00:15:55,176 --> 00:15:59,012
If you're not a healer,
how did you save Ava's leg?

241
00:16:01,098 --> 00:16:03,936
I remember you and that little cub...

242
00:16:04,023 --> 00:16:06,937
both so frightened and sad.

243
00:16:08,189 --> 00:16:09,978
I saw she had lost her leg,

244
00:16:10,065 --> 00:16:14,069
and I understood that humans
would have trouble accepting her.

245
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:21,243
But I knew her spirit was strong
and that was all that really mattered.

246
00:16:21,952 --> 00:16:23,578
[Ellis sobbing]

247
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,921
[Lujanne] Oh, what a beautiful creature.

248
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:34,506
[voice breaking] No... she's hurt.

249
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:38,135
She's perfect.

250
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:42,180
[indistinct chanting]

251
00:16:50,105 --> 00:16:54,231
[Lujanne] To help you,
I created an illusion.

252
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:59,239
A leg that others would see and feel,
even though it wasn't real.

253
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,996
I enchanted the moonstone collar
to hold the spell.

254
00:17:06,413 --> 00:17:09,710
She never needed that fourth leg
to be happy.

255
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:11,501
Everyone else did.

256
00:17:18,592 --> 00:17:20,387
But the help we need is real.

257
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:22,679
An illusion won't help us.

258
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:26,809
[gasps]

259
00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:33,067
[Rayla] It's the egg of the Dragon Prince.
It was stolen, but we saved it.

260
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:36,987
I mean, we were trying to save it
and return it to its mother.

261
00:17:37,074 --> 00:17:40,530
But there was a terrible accident.
You see, I...

262
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:44,745
Its life is fading quickly.

263
00:17:44,832 --> 00:17:49,206
The only chance of saving it now
would be to hatch it.

264
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,290
But that won't be possible.

265
00:17:53,377 --> 00:17:56,671
Sky dragons can only be born
in the eye of a storm.

266
00:17:56,758 --> 00:17:59,549
The weather is clear for miles.

267
00:18:04,722 --> 00:18:08,978
No... that can't be.
There has to be a way to save it!

268
00:18:09,065 --> 00:18:11,061
[softly] I'm sorry.

269
00:18:17,151 --> 00:18:20,904
I dropped it. This is all my fault.

270
00:18:22,031 --> 00:18:24,738
No, I should have trusted you.

271
00:18:24,825 --> 00:18:27,619
Things only went wrong
because we kept fighting.

272
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:30,622
I let you both down.

273
00:18:31,248 --> 00:18:33,542
I let the world down.

274
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:35,137
You tried, Rayla.

275
00:18:35,205 --> 00:18:36,253
[exclaims]

276
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,339
You're so good and brave.

277
00:18:47,932 --> 00:18:52,185
Wait a minute.
It can only hatch... in a storm.

278
00:18:53,771 --> 00:18:56,565
- What if I...
- [lightning crackles faintly]

279
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,152
I know what I have to do.

280
00:19:04,573 --> 00:19:07,033
[electricity crackling]

281
00:19:26,971 --> 00:19:28,805
[Ezran] No!

282
00:19:50,202 --> 00:19:51,745
[Bait grunts]

283
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:58,418
Hold on, Rayla!

284
00:20:01,255 --> 00:20:02,381
Ahh!

285
00:20:26,989 --> 00:20:29,324
[lightning crackles]

286
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:27,299
[cracking]

287
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:37,059
[yawns]

288
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:42,411
[yips]

289
00:21:43,524 --> 00:21:47,986
Come on Bait, help him!
His eyes are stuck.

290
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:51,364
- [Bait grunts]
- You need to lick them open!

291
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,751
[yips inquisitively]

292
00:22:05,045 --> 00:22:07,213
[Ezran laughs]

293
00:22:13,887 --> 00:22:17,057
You know your own name! Azymondias.

294
00:22:19,226 --> 00:22:21,105
- We'll call you "Zym."
- [Bait grunts]

295
00:22:21,192 --> 00:22:25,899
That's Rayla. You almost blew off
the mountain, but Rayla saved you!

296
00:22:30,487 --> 00:22:32,572
[purrs softly]

297
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:35,989
[Rayla] Aww! It's okay, little one.

298
00:22:36,076 --> 00:22:40,663
The important thing is you.
One miracle is enough for me today.

299
00:22:58,765 --> 00:22:59,766
[laughs]

300
00:23:16,116 --> 00:23:18,284
[wind howling]

301
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:21,915
- Couldn't you do this someplace warmer?
- No.

302
00:23:22,002 --> 00:23:23,787
But if you like,

303
00:23:23,874 --> 00:23:27,421
I can use these rare components
to conjure a magical blanket for you

304
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:30,424
instead of using them
to locate the lost princes?

305
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:33,176
You would be insanely comfortable.

306
00:23:33,263 --> 00:23:36,052
[grunts] Fine, I'll suffer.

307
00:23:42,225 --> 00:23:45,145
[chanting indistinctly]

308
00:23:55,322 --> 00:23:58,741
[chanting continues]

309
00:24:02,996 --> 00:24:04,330
[Claudia] There!

310
00:24:04,873 --> 00:24:07,000
That's where we'll find them.

311
00:24:08,085 --> 00:24:10,587
[Ezran laughing]

312
00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:13,256
Look.

313
00:24:22,557 --> 00:24:24,267
It's beautiful.

314
00:24:25,852 --> 00:24:29,066
They're gentle. They even tickle a little.

315
00:24:29,153 --> 00:24:30,524
[blows]

316
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,236
[chitters excitedly]

317
00:24:38,022 --> 00:24:39,312
[grunts]

318
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,701
[belches]

319
00:24:41,294 --> 00:24:43,286
