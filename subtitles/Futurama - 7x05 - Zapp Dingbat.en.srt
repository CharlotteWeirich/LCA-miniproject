2
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:46,967
Hey, guys.

3
00:00:47,092 --> 00:00:49,337
Welcome to my parents'
40th anniversary party.

4
00:00:49,462 --> 00:00:51,218
I'm bored.
Let's drink.

5
00:00:55,596 --> 00:00:58,011
Wow, what a turnout.

6
00:00:58,136 --> 00:01:01,048
It's great to see
so many happy smiles,

7
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:02,729
most of them on mouth mutant.

8
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:04,619
(All laugh)

9
00:01:04,744 --> 00:01:06,108
All:
Hey-o!

10
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,623
But let me just say, for 40 years,

11
00:01:08,748 --> 00:01:12,072
my beautiful wife Munda
has been by my side...

12
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,728
Even that year my side mutated

13
00:01:13,853 --> 00:01:15,829
into some kind of venomous radish.

14
00:01:15,954 --> 00:01:17,465
And, Morris, I fell in love

15
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,533
with your honesty and humility.

16
00:01:19,658 --> 00:01:22,303
And those things never mutated.

17
00:01:22,428 --> 00:01:24,042
Both:
Mmm...

18
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,172
All:
Aw...

19
00:01:25,297 --> 00:01:26,795
(Guttural):
Aw...

20
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,409
Now, if you'll direct your attention

21
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:30,215
to this moldy shower curtain,

22
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,218
I've prepared a video tribute
to the happy couple.

23
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,889
In their 40 years together,

24
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:41,018
my parents have been through so much.

25
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,491
Well, not that much, actually,
since mutants weren't allowed

26
00:01:43,616 --> 00:01:45,660
to leave the sewers until last year.

27
00:01:45,785 --> 00:01:48,775
Like anyone wants to leave
the sewer. Am I right?

28
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:50,402
(All laugh)

29
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,945
Shush, Morris.

30
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,780
So, how did it all begin?

31
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:56,616
The unlikely lovebirds met
at brown university.

32
00:01:56,782 --> 00:01:59,661
She, a brilliant
exolinguistics major,

33
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:02,910
he, a laid-back sewer surfer
who didn't even know

34
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:04,708
the meaning of "exolinguistics".

35
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,168
I still have no idea.

36
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,128
(All laugh)

37
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,718
I've been telling you for 40 years,

38
00:02:10,843 --> 00:02:13,354
it's the study of alien languages.

39
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,522
Why can't you listen?

40
00:02:14,647 --> 00:02:16,424
Oh, sugar lump, I hear you

41
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:19,347
when you actually say
something important.

42
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:21,228
Leela:
But sometimes opposites attract,

43
00:02:21,353 --> 00:02:24,365
and like the fairy tale
of face mutant and butt mutant,

44
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,769
the love of Munda and Morris
has grown stronger every day.

45
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:30,609
Munda:
"Something important"?

46
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,573
Exolinguistics was my passion.

47
00:02:32,698 --> 00:02:34,375
Until I gave it up to go into

48
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,310
the lucrative pot-roast-making field.

49
00:02:36,435 --> 00:02:37,812
Pot-roast-burning.

50
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:40,614
I never got why you studied
that alien junk anyway.

51
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,983
We can't even see the stars
down here in the sewer.

52
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:44,418
Why can't you accept that?

53
00:02:44,543 --> 00:02:47,421
I did accept it... for 40 years!

54
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:49,590
But now we're free to go up there.

55
00:02:49,715 --> 00:02:52,292
I could be in space seeing
things I've only dreamed about,

56
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:54,382
if it weren't for you!

57
00:02:54,548 --> 00:02:57,965
Uh, okay, everybody,
thanks for coming.

58
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,888
I had dreams, too!

59
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,802
I was going to surf
the world's sewers,

60
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:05,072
but I happily gave it up
for you. Happily!

61
00:03:05,197 --> 00:03:07,441
I just want a little
more out of life.

62
00:03:07,566 --> 00:03:10,444
But no, you don't want
to go into space

63
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:11,779
because you're too afraid.

64
00:03:11,904 --> 00:03:14,682
You bet I'm afraid.
You want to go? Go!

65
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:17,084
Get your head knocked off
by a meteorite.

66
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:19,533
Okay, take a deep breath.

67
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,255
You're having
a little lovers' quarrel,

68
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,036
but I'm sure you'll work
everything...

69
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:25,884
Divorce is final.

70
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,960
Munda:
<i>Don't worry.</i>

71
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,599
I'm only going to stay with you

72
00:03:31,724 --> 00:03:33,588
until a vacancy opens
up on this floor.

73
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:36,716
You know, the rents are
a lot more reasonable in Peru.

74
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:38,639
Come on, Leela, let's go out.

75
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:41,388
After 40 years,
I want to see the world.

76
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,544
(Sighs) What the heck?

77
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:46,393
You want to go out?
Let's really go out.

78
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:56,047
(Jaunty jazz playing)

79
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,746
Dance, slave, dance.

80
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:14,065
(Groaning)

81
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:18,402
(Zaps)

82
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:22,941
(Buzzing)

83
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:28,388
Well, I lost two straight hands
to the borax kid.

84
00:04:28,513 --> 00:04:30,057
I don't really have
any use for these,

85
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:32,355
but you can't have them back. Ladies.

86
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:35,930
Imagine... me, a girl from the sewer

87
00:04:36,055 --> 00:04:38,987
meeting a man made
entirely of detergent.

88
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,489
(Gasps) And look over there!

89
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:44,784
It's Zapp Brannigan,
the famous space captain.

90
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,941
Hey, I have an idea.

91
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:49,009
Let's look in a different
direction at something else.

92
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:50,457
You go ahead, dear.

93
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,346
I wonder what
Captain Brannigan's doing

94
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:53,835
with those Carcarons?

95
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:56,630
Now, regarding
this peace treaty, Admiral Chu.

96
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,619
That's a napkin dispenser, sir.

97
00:04:58,744 --> 00:05:00,888
This is the universal translator.

98
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:02,222
Whatever.

99
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:04,758
Now, Admiral, in exchange
for your promise

100
00:05:04,883 --> 00:05:07,561
not to attack us, we will grant you

101
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:11,131
exclusive fishing rights
in Supernova Scotia.

102
00:05:11,256 --> 00:05:14,606
(Translated guttural
alien language plays)

103
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,234
(Replies in guttural alien language)

104
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,486
Well, okay.

105
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,774
Excellent.

106
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:22,710
We'll meet aboard
my ship in one month

107
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:24,311
to sign the treaty of table seven.

108
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:26,279
(Alien language translation plays)

109
00:05:26,404 --> 00:05:28,828
Table seven?

110
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:32,486
Now, watch, Kif,
as I score a diplomatic Coop

111
00:05:32,611 --> 00:05:35,126
by congratulating the Admiral
in his native tongue.

112
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:36,757
Last time you tried that,

113
00:05:36,882 --> 00:05:38,993
the Mexican restaurant
declared war on us.

114
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:41,508
I beg you, just use the translator.

115
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,231
Kif, just trust me for once.

116
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:46,012
(Speaks alien language)

117
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:48,890
I'd like to spank your sister
with a slice of bologna.

118
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:50,517
(Chuckles) Oops.

119
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,697
(Angry, guttural reply)

120
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:56,898
(Weapons cocking)

121
00:05:57,064 --> 00:05:58,679
(Zapp gasps)

122
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:01,194
It's the battle of
Paco's tacos all over again.

123
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,850
(Whimpers)

124
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:05,824
(Speaking alien language)

125
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,021
Mom, what are you doing?

126
00:06:07,146 --> 00:06:08,576
What I was trained to do.

127
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:11,079
(Speaks alien language)

128
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,718
(Speaks alien language)

129
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,876
What did you say to them?

130
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:19,633
Eh, just that Captain Brannigan
confused the word

131
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:21,669
for "congratulations"
with the word for

132
00:06:21,794 --> 00:06:23,341
"spank your sister with bologna."

133
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:25,260
Nicely squawked, madam.

134
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,541
Leela, you never told me
you had a mother.

135
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:31,057
I insist you stay
for a courtesy thank-you drink.

136
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:35,115
(Low whirring)

137
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,450
Mmm, good barium shots.

138
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:38,440
Expensive, though.
We can put it on

139
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,443
the corporate card,
as long as we discuss business.

140
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,458
So, uh, yesterday, huh?

141
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,027
That business happened, right?

142
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:48,161
Somebody?

143
00:06:48,286 --> 00:06:50,197
I'll just pay for it.

144
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:51,565
Well, we should get going.

145
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,133
You guys see where my mom went?

146
00:06:53,258 --> 00:06:55,135
I don't know where most of her is,

147
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,624
but her tongue's in Zapp's mouth.

148
00:06:57,996 --> 00:06:59,764
Both:
Mmm...

149
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,300
Whoo! Nasty.

150
00:07:26,103 --> 00:07:27,417
{pub}Mom, are you okay?

151
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:29,086
Did Zapp take advantage of you?

152
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:31,785
Show me where he touched you
on this dried-apple doll.

153
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,023
Oh, don't be silly.

154
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:35,258
Zapp's a perfect gentleman.

155
00:07:35,383 --> 00:07:37,027
And so handsome.

156
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:39,709
Did you know he wears
a velour man-skirt?

157
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,065
(Groans) Mom, I hate
to break it to you,

158
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,200
but Zapp's a jerk.

159
00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:45,402
The truth is...

160
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:47,717
I once slept with him...
A few times.

161
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:49,172
I know.

162
00:07:49,297 --> 00:07:50,720
He showed me
the commemorative painting.

163
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:53,710
- What?!
- Look, sweetie, I get it.

164
00:07:53,835 --> 00:07:56,546
You're jealous because Zapp
likes me now and not you.

165
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,449
But don't worry,
this isn't a competition.

166
00:07:59,574 --> 00:08:01,439
Although he did say
I'm a better kisser.

167
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:03,253
I am not jealous.

168
00:08:03,378 --> 00:08:05,318
Also, yech!

169
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:08,925
Zapp doesn't care about my mom.

170
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,824
He's just doing this to get to me.

171
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,095
Don't worry, Leela.

172
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,630
Your mom won't see Zapp much.

173
00:08:13,755 --> 00:08:15,328
He's in space all the time.

174
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:16,621
(Device trills)

175
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,268
Guess what, honey.

176
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:20,303
Zapp hired me
as his personal translator.

177
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:23,128
I'll be with him all the time...
In space.

178
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,207
What? But...

179
00:08:24,332 --> 00:08:25,442
I've never been so happy!

180
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:27,006
(Device trills)
Hang on, mom.

181
00:08:27,235 --> 00:08:28,778
I have another call.

182
00:08:28,903 --> 00:08:30,204
(Sobbing)

183
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,254
(Sobs)
Thank you for coming.

184
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:38,655
You know, without your mother,

185
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,146
the sewer's a dank and dismal place.

186
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,093
Dad, we need to talk.

187
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:44,994
Mom is...

188
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:46,860
Well, she's seeing someone else.

189
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,631
Who is it, mouth mutant?

190
00:08:48,756 --> 00:08:51,101
I ought to punch him
right in his big mouth.

191
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:52,824
And then in all his smaller mouths!

192
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,992
No, no, listen.

193
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,806
It's time to get on with your life.

194
00:08:56,931 --> 00:08:58,275
But she was my life.

195
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,497
Bender:
Aw.

196
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,168
What?

197
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,615
Hey, what about your lifelong dream?

198
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,417
Didn't you always want to surf

199
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:08,918
the world's greatest sewers?

200
00:09:09,043 --> 00:09:11,551
Yeah, and Fry and Bender
can go with you.

201
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:13,423
You can teach them how to surf,

202
00:09:13,548 --> 00:09:15,192
and they can make sure you don't...

203
00:09:15,317 --> 00:09:18,391
(Mimics cork pop, gulping,
blubbering, gunshot sound)

204
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,697
I don't know.
Would you come, too, sweetie?

205
00:09:20,822 --> 00:09:22,520
I can't.

206
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:25,835
I have to keep an eye on mom to
make sure she and Zapp don't...

207
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,605
(Mimics air raid siren,
train chugging)

208
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,361
Yee-haw!

209
00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:32,675
You know what?
I'm going to give it a shot.

210
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,576
Let's go surf the great
sewer waves of the world!

211
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:49,172
(Squeaking)

212
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,277
(Speaking alien language)

213
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,102
Where have you been?

214
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,104
What?
It's 2:00 in the afternoon.

215
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,517
Several days later.

216
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:48,885
Look, enough is enough.

217
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,520
Zapp is a jerk.

218
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:52,318
I insist you break up with him.

219
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:54,691
Why can't you just let me be happy?

220
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:57,460
After all these years, I'm
going places I've never been,

221
00:10:57,585 --> 00:10:59,450
and having sex there.

222
00:10:59,616 --> 00:11:01,286
You're too old to be happy.

223
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,955
I'm not too old to enjoy
hot sex with Zapp.

224
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,331
Ugh!

225
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:06,803
Sex with Zapp!
Ew!

226
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:08,438
Sex with Zapp!
Aah!

227
00:11:08,563 --> 00:11:10,837
Sex with Zapp!
No, no!

228
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,375
Now, if you'll excuse me,

229
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,143
I don't think I
can live here anymore.

230
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:16,269
I'll be back for my things
at 8:00 sharp.

231
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:18,845
(Beeping)

232
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,014
Sex with Zapp!

233
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,557
- This one is for the E. Coli...
- Ow!

234
00:11:27,682 --> 00:11:31,107
- And this one's for the leprechaunorrhea.
- Hiddly-Dee!

235
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,463
I don't care how many
diseases Fry has.

236
00:11:33,588 --> 00:11:34,731
It was worth it.

237
00:11:34,856 --> 00:11:35,998
Right on, brah!

238
00:11:36,123 --> 00:11:37,655
I feel free as a bum.

239
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:39,436
How can you be so calm, dad?

240
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:40,970
The woman you love is out there

241
00:11:41,095 --> 00:11:43,673
having the time of her life
with Zapp Brannigan,

242
00:11:43,798 --> 00:11:45,705
and you're not doing
anything to stop it.

243
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,677
Surfing helped me chill out, honey.

244
00:11:47,802 --> 00:11:49,812
When you're down there
riding the waves,

245
00:11:49,937 --> 00:11:51,615
the wind ripening in your face,

246
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,083
everything just makes sense, dude.

247
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,382
You mind if I
call you dude, princess?

248
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:59,256
Look, I don't want to put
a rat in your face-cage,

249
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:01,190
or whatever you kids say nowadays,

250
00:12:01,315 --> 00:12:03,526
but Zapp's using mom to get to me,

251
00:12:03,651 --> 00:12:05,141
and I'm going to prove it!

252
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:09,165
Kif, I'm bored.

253
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,433
What say you go out on the wing

254
00:12:10,558 --> 00:12:11,668
and pretend you're a gremlin?

255
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:13,232
(Sighs)

256
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:15,360
Well, if it isn't

257
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,403
my second favorite Turanga girl.

258
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:19,776
Hi, Zapp. I was wondering
if you'd like

259
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:21,711
to have dinner tonight
with me and my mom.

260
00:12:21,836 --> 00:12:24,285
You know, to celebrate
your genuine love for her.

261
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:25,948
Sounds good.

262
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:28,831
And don't forget my genuine love
for par-me-zian cheese.

263
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:31,488
Shall we say about 7:58?

264
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:33,002
Precisely?

265
00:12:37,714 --> 00:12:39,926
Nice to see you, Zapp.

266
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,699
Well, nice to see a surprising
amount of you, too, Leela.

267
00:12:42,824 --> 00:12:43,930
Is Munda here?

268
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,536
Mommy's not home, big boy.

269
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:48,905
We both know you're just
using her to get to me.

270
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:53,106
So let's do it... right here
by the front door at 7:59.

271
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,183
Leela, does your mother know
you're using her pole?

272
00:13:00,308 --> 00:13:01,406
(Grunts)

273
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,852
Come on, I'm all yours!

274
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:05,576
Have your way with me
for the next 30 seconds.

275
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:07,590
That would be more
than enough time...

276
00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:09,455
But I can't.
I love Munda.

277
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:10,957
I love everything about her:

278
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,829
Her laugh, her maturity,

279
00:13:12,954 --> 00:13:16,199
the cold, lifeless touch
of her tentacle on my body.

280
00:13:16,324 --> 00:13:19,841
She is one juicy calamari.

281
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,338
Munda:
Oh, Zapp...

282
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:22,552
I love you, too.

283
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,107
(Gasps)
Oh, squiddums!

284
00:13:25,232 --> 00:13:28,141
I've been thinking about this
for a while, and, well...

285
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,246
Here in front of your
half-naked daughter

286
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:32,228
seems like the perfect time.

287
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,950
Darling...

288
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:35,606
Will I marry you?

289
00:13:35,772 --> 00:13:37,650
Of course, I'll marry you, Zapp.

290
00:13:41,315 --> 00:13:44,761
I, uh, think a motel room
might be in order.

291
00:13:44,886 --> 00:13:46,896
Leela, here's $40.

292
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:48,297
Mom, don't do this.

293
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:50,913
Zapp is a selfish, womanizing idiot.

294
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:53,082
There's no need to
call me names, Leela.

295
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:54,471
Just call me...

296
00:13:54,596 --> 00:13:56,169
"Daddy."

297
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,632
(Screams)

298
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:03,384
{pub}Mom, if you try to marry Zapp,

299
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,803
I will shove you
into a filthy nursing home

300
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,038
so fast you won't know what hit you.

301
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,541
Probably, it'll be a filthy nurse.

302
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:14,344
Leela, you're my daughter
and I love you, but cram it!

303
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:15,813
Morris:
Is this a bad time?

304
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:17,548
I was riding the el torito
dinner backwash,

305
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:18,858
and I thought I'd pop in.

306
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,050
Oh, thank God you're here.

307
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:21,485
If we don't do something,

308
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,738
mom's going to marry Zapp Brannigan!

309
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,956
So? He seems like a nice kahuna.

310
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:28,325
Dad, stop being so mellow.

311
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,620
Leela, honey, chill out.

312
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,529
You got to take the good
with the gnarly.

313
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:35,298
Speaking of which, time for me
to shoot the ihop dessert curl.

314
00:14:35,423 --> 00:14:36,793
(Wave splashes)

315
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,711
(Groans)

316
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,544
Oh, you sure you won't come
to your mom's wedding?

317
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:49,806
There'll be
"chicken or fish, circle one."

318
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,147
I can't.

319
00:14:51,272 --> 00:14:52,382
Not when I believe with all my heart

320
00:14:52,507 --> 00:14:54,060
that this marriage is a mistake.

321
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,720
I know you're upset
that your parents broke up.

322
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:59,816
But what if Zapp really
does make Munda happy?

323
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,109
What if they're meant to be together?

324
00:15:02,275 --> 00:15:03,426
Fry, that's just so...

325
00:15:03,551 --> 00:15:04,995
I can't even believe...

326
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,530
You are so totally...

327
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,931
Right.

328
00:15:08,056 --> 00:15:09,450
You're right.

329
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:11,167
I am? Huh.

330
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:14,247
Maybe Zapp isn't the only one
who's marriage material.

331
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,166
You're getting there.

332
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:25,591
(Grunting)

333
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:32,523
Leela?

334
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:33,790
You look beautiful, mom.

335
00:15:33,915 --> 00:15:35,358
Really?

336
00:15:35,483 --> 00:15:38,688
I'm not showing too much
sucker for a lady my age?

337
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:39,963
Just the right amount.

338
00:15:40,088 --> 00:15:41,464
You'll make a lovely bride.

339
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:43,109
Oh, mom...

340
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,112
I'm sorry I've been
so horrible to you.

341
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,271
Ah, you weren't so horrible.

342
00:15:48,396 --> 00:15:50,765
Just enough to show you care.

343
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,580
♪

344
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:07,958
At ease, darling.

345
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,594
Honored guests...
And Kif.

346
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,796
One of a captain's many superpowers

347
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:15,599
is the ability to conduct marriage.

348
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:19,169
So I will now join myself
in holy macaroni.

349
00:16:19,294 --> 00:16:22,505
Kif, raise the ceremonial mirror.

350
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,908
Zapp, you magnificent bastard,

351
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:26,735
do you take Munda
to be your lawful...

352
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,820
(Alarms whoop)

353
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,948
Alien ships approaching, sir.

354
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,020
It's the Carcarons!
Oh, meatballs.

355
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:39,749
I forgot they were coming
to sign the peace treaty today.

356
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,859
Ladies and gentlemen,
my blushing translator and I

357
00:16:42,984 --> 00:16:44,294
have business to tend to.

358
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:45,696
In the meantime,

359
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:49,425
enjoy the comic stylings
of Nixon and Agnew.

360
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:54,805
Oh, Mr. Agnew?

361
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,140
(Monster-like grunting)

362
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,101
Munda, tell the Admiral

363
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:00,677
that by signing this peace treaty,

364
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:03,105
we will achieve harmony
between our worlds.

365
00:17:03,271 --> 00:17:05,482
Zapp, honey,
this is the wrong document.

366
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,850
It's not a peace treaty.

367
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:09,028
It says they're declaring war on us.

368
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,520
Brilliant, isn't I?

369
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:13,624
The moment they sign,
we destroy their fleet

370
00:17:13,749 --> 00:17:17,662
in one glorious burst of
quote-unquote "self-defense."

371
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:18,996
Up high, Mrs. Brannigan.

372
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,833
Don't leave me hanging,
Mrs. Brannigan.

373
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:26,469
I come from the sewer,
but that is low.

374
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:28,505
I'm not going to translate your lies.

375
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,675
Munda, dear, as your captain
and soon-to-be husband,

376
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,209
I gave you an order.

377
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:35,178
Now, let's tell these vicious lies

378
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:36,680
and get back to our sacred vows.

379
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,515
There's not going to be any wedding.

380
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,250
I don't want your fancy ring.

381
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,418
Careful! That's glass!

382
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:43,887
Leela was right.

383
00:17:44,012 --> 00:17:45,889
You're a lousy man
and a lousy captain.

384
00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:49,026
And I'm going to tell our
Carcaron friends the truth.

385
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:50,827
(Speaking alien language)

386
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:53,220
Zapp... lying sack of...

387
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,824
(Speaking alien language)

388
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:01,571
Well, this is awkward.

389
00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:03,774
Our Carcaron friends declared war.

390
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:06,743
Then, once again, my lies
have been proven true.

391
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,254
(Explosion, screams)

392
00:18:10,071 --> 00:18:11,948
We're under attack
and the wedding's off.

393
00:18:12,073 --> 00:18:14,343
Kif, return fire and the cake.

394
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:16,286
Our weapons are disabled,

395
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:17,954
and you can't return ice cream cakes!

396
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:19,306
We're doomed!

397
00:18:19,472 --> 00:18:21,682
(Clattering)

398
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,145
Stop the wedding!

399
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,980
(Gasping, exclaiming)
Morris?

400
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,264
I'm not giving up the love
of my life without a fight.

401
00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:29,532
(Grunts)

402
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:31,986
Do I know you?
(Groans)

403
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,136
Dad?

404
00:18:33,261 --> 00:18:34,404
I thought you were all zen

405
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:35,865
with mom getting remarried.

406
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,107
I was at first.

407
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:38,942
But then I conquered my inner peace.

408
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:42,245
If you care about something,
you've got to take action.

409
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,748
Harsh, violent action!

410
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,292
(Screaming)

411
00:18:50,378 --> 00:18:51,672
Kif, get us out of here.

412
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:53,990
Navigation is out.

413
00:18:54,115 --> 00:18:55,718
We're sitting ducks.

414
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,636
Is there an auxiliary control system?

415
00:18:57,802 --> 00:18:59,096
Yes, outside on the hull.

416
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,474
But there are 20
separate control keys.

417
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,766
No one could work them well enough

418
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,167
to ride out these energy waves.

419
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:05,559
No one?

420
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:10,173
It's time to hang 20!

421
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,843
Munda:
Morris!

422
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:15,411
What are you doing?
Hold on to your coconuts.

423
00:19:15,695 --> 00:19:18,115
We're going for
the ride of a lifetime!

424

♪

425
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,916
but I thought you were
terrified of outer space.

426
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,524
I was, but then it hit me.

427
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:30,360
If heaven's above us,

428
00:19:30,485 --> 00:19:34,821
then the whole universe
is just God's glorious sewer.

What do we do?
Who do we blame?

We don't blame anyone.

434
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,526
We make peace.

435
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,361
One word can end this.

436
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,362
Then say it.

437
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,323
No, you say it.

This actual peace treaty
is hereby enacted.

Want to give it another go?

447
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:34,224
Well, I am still in my wedding dress.

448
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:35,609
And we still have a cake.

449
