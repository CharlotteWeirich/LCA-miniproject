1
00:00:09,094 --> 00:00:10,720
Ba-bum.

2
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,455
[croaks]

3
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:15,915
[panting]

4
00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:32,670
[Aaravos] Long ago, Xadia was one land...

5
00:00:33,903 --> 00:00:38,279
rich in magic and wonder.

6
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:50,326
In the old times, there were only
the six Primal Sources of magic...

7
00:00:51,517 --> 00:00:55,318
The Sun. The Moon.

8
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,738
The Stars.

9
00:01:01,135 --> 00:01:02,762
The Earth.

10
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,542
The Sky.

11
00:01:11,262 --> 00:01:13,099
And the Ocean.

12
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:21,906
But a thousand years ago,
a human mage discovered new magic...

13
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:24,717
- the seventh source.
- [screams]

14
00:01:24,804 --> 00:01:26,490
Dark Magic.

15
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:40,979
It used the essence
within magical creatures themselves

16
00:01:41,508 --> 00:01:45,838
to unleash dark power.

17
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:02,677
Horrified by what they saw,

18
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:07,672
the elves and the dragons
put a stop to the madness.

19
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,135
They drove every last human to the west.

20
00:02:12,273 --> 00:02:16,666
And so, the continent was divided in two.

21
00:02:16,898 --> 00:02:20,408
In the east, the magical lands of Xadia.

22
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:24,549
And in the west, the human kingdoms.

23
00:02:27,242 --> 00:02:33,580
For centuries, the King of the Dragons
himself defended the border.

24
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:37,166
- [roaring]
- [thunder rumbling]

25
00:02:40,505 --> 00:02:44,377
- Forward!
- [crowd] Forward!

26
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:55,856
The humans called him Thunder,
for when he spoke,

27
00:02:55,943 --> 00:03:00,916
his voice shook the Earth and the sky.

28
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:07,325
But on the eve of last Winter's Turn,

29
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:14,136
the humans used unspeakable Dark Magic
to slay Thunder.

30
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:20,320
Then, without mercy,
they destroyed his only egg, his heir...

31
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:23,229
the Dragon Prince.

32
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:30,194
Now the world stands on the edge
of all-out war.

[Ezran and Bait snoring]

[Callum exclaims]

37
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:19,986
Take that, marshmallow monster.

- [yelps]
- [squeals] Callum!

41
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:27,942
It's okay, Ezran.

42
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:30,622
It's just a thunderstorm.
Nothing to be afraid of.

43
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,266
Go back to sleep.

44
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:34,550
I wasn't scared...

45
00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:36,461
Bait was scared.

46
00:04:36,548 --> 00:04:38,304
[Bait growls]

47
00:04:56,732 --> 00:04:58,290
Who's there?

48
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:04,163
Declare yourself,
in the name of King Harrow!

49
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:13,453
[exclaims]

50
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,305
[panting]

51
00:05:42,938 --> 00:05:44,256
Please!

52
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:48,041
Who are you?

53
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:06,294
[panting]

00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:32,911
[knocking at door]

55
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:35,698
High Mage! Please, it's urgent!

56
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:38,799
[knocking continues]

57
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:44,440
Lord Viren! I've seen something.

58
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:55,510
Lord Viren, uh...
King Harrow hasn't risen yet.

59
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,120
[whistling]

60
00:07:07,605 --> 00:07:11,596
Viren, didn't I tell you if you ever
woke me up this early again...

61
00:07:11,683 --> 00:07:13,917
I'd have you executed?

62
00:07:14,112 --> 00:07:17,129
[clears throat] I'll give you a moment.

63
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,774
So, what's so important that you come into
my bedroom risking your life like this?

64
00:07:33,425 --> 00:07:34,922
Assassins.

65
00:07:35,136 --> 00:07:36,476
I see.

66
00:07:36,634 --> 00:07:40,330
A scout on patrol discovered them
just before dawn.

67
00:07:40,555 --> 00:07:44,149
Well, don't look so grim.
We've fought off plenty of assassins.

68
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:45,347
Haven't we, Pip?

69
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:47,235
It's different this time.

70
00:07:47,322 --> 00:07:50,682
We believe they're Moonshadow elves.

71
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:55,376
Moonshadow elves?
Then how did the scout escape?

72
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:59,026
I don't know. It was muddy, wet, dark...

73
00:07:59,164 --> 00:08:01,965
Somehow he got very lucky.

74
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,916
The Crown Guard won't be enough
to hold them off.

75
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:08,284
Send for General Amaya
and the Standing Battalion.

76
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:12,267
The Breach is too far.
They'll never make it back in time.

77
00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:14,697
[Harrow] What's tonight's moon?

78
00:08:14,859 --> 00:08:16,271
[Viren] Full.

79
00:08:16,591 --> 00:08:18,881
[Harrow chuckles] Of course it is...

80
00:08:18,968 --> 00:08:22,361
[Viren] With the Moonshadow elves
at the height of their power,

81
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:25,003
no defense will stand against them.

82
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:28,955
Then we won't defend. We will attack.

83
00:08:29,187 --> 00:08:32,347
We must find them today,
in the light of the sun,

84
00:08:32,434 --> 00:08:34,492
and stop them before it's too late.

85
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,099
[chirping]

86
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,342
[sighs]

87
00:09:26,703 --> 00:09:28,336
Well done, Rayla.

88
00:09:28,423 --> 00:09:31,430
Yeah. I used both of them.

89
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:34,133
I can see that.

90
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:54,188
[sniffs]

91
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,614
- [croaks]
- Bait, shh.

92
00:10:11,202 --> 00:10:15,172
Prince Ezran! [chuckles menacingly]
I caught you!

93
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:17,883
I was just... admiring them.

94
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,968
Oh. With your hands?

95
00:10:20,055 --> 00:10:23,670
Yeah. They look amazing.

96
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:27,184
Well, they are amazing,
and they're not for you!

97
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:30,204
Or your little monster, Bait.

98
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,845
[stammering] Did you just...

99
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,491
You can tell by his eyes he's innocent.

100
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:41,289
Are you kidding me?
I'm standing right here.

101
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:42,935
Hey!

102
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:44,178
[croaks]

103
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:53,024
[sighs]

104
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:05,034
Prince Callum.
Today we focus on the art of...

105
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:07,591
Art! Finally something I'm good at.

106
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:11,665
Sorry, sorry. Won't interrupt again.

107
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:14,305
Please... continue, Soren.

108
00:11:15,225 --> 00:11:19,469
The art of defense
is critical in sword-fighting.

109
00:11:19,562 --> 00:11:22,989
Parrying is about angle, motion,
anticipation...

110
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:27,001
Misjudge your opponent,
and it's over. You ready?

111
00:11:29,781 --> 00:11:31,748
Uh, I'm gonna have to say no.

112
00:11:31,835 --> 00:11:34,050
Great. Let's do this.

113
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:41,057
Parry, parry, parry... You're dead.

114
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:43,458
Parry, parry... You're dead.

115
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:45,645
- Parry... Dead.
- [Callum exclaims]

116
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:48,640
Really? Are you sure?
Even if I was wearing armor?

117
00:11:48,727 --> 00:11:51,685
Even if you were wearing
the rarest legendary armor,

118
00:11:51,763 --> 00:11:53,280
forged by Sunfire elves...

119
00:11:53,348 --> 00:11:54,361
Super dead.

120
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:56,387
- [scoffs] I'm terrible at this!
- Yep.

121
00:11:56,474 --> 00:11:58,108
But you have to practice anyway,

122
00:11:58,195 --> 00:12:00,534
because that's what's expected
of a prince.

123
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,697
- Or a step-prince, actually.
- What?

124
00:12:03,784 --> 00:12:04,858
What?

125
00:12:15,714 --> 00:12:17,057
[Callum] Hey, your sister.

126
00:12:17,144 --> 00:12:19,420
- She's gonna walk right into that...
- Shh.

127
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:23,355
Claudia!

128
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:27,144
Oh. Hi, Callum!

129
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,690
You're no fun.

130
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:34,561
- Is this new?
- [Callum] Relatively new.

131
00:12:34,648 --> 00:12:37,981
[chuckles]
It's only been there for 300 years.

132
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:39,657
[Claudia laughs]

133
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:41,060
[sighs]

134
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:45,913
Hey, uh, can we try again?
I think I can do it now.

135
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:52,822
[screams]

136
00:12:54,943 --> 00:12:55,967
[grunts]

137
00:12:56,115 --> 00:12:58,825
- What was that?
- I don't know.

138
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:01,504
Uh, I was trying to "sweep the leg"?

139
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:04,598
That's not a thing in sword-fighting.

140
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:09,235
Oh. [chuckles]

141
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:11,605
I see what's going on here.

142
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,132
Don't worry, I'll help.

143
00:13:14,219 --> 00:13:16,110
You come at me this time.

144
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,865
[yells]

145
00:13:18,892 --> 00:13:23,630
[grunts] Oh, I am stabbed!
By the stab-prince!

146
00:13:23,717 --> 00:13:27,580
Lord Stabbington! Why? Spurt!

147
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:28,928
Spurt!

148
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:31,920
[chuckles] Nice work, Callum.

149
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:34,106
[sighs] He deserves it.

150
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:38,632
Prince Callum.
The King needs to speak with you urgently.

151
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,852
He didn't really stab me.

152
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,478
[knocking at door]

153
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,857
Boys!

154
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,059
You're going on a trip.

155
00:13:56,146 --> 00:13:57,967
To the Banther Lodge!

156
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:00,939
But... it's spring.
That's the winter lodge.

157
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:04,807
Eh. Winter is coming... eventually.

158
00:14:04,894 --> 00:14:09,155
What will we do? Everything fun there
has to do with snow or ice.

159
00:14:09,242 --> 00:14:13,827
Maybe you can invent new versions using...
dirt and rocks.

160
00:14:13,914 --> 00:14:16,663
You could build a dirt man! Or...

161
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,743
what about mud-sledding?

162
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,674
That could be a thing!

163
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:22,619
[croaks]

164
00:14:23,553 --> 00:14:26,423
Look, this is something I need you to do.

165
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,748
- Dad...
- It's decided.

166
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:32,103
You'll leave before sundown,
so go get packed up.

167
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,399
Yes, sir. Come on, Ez.

168
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:41,010
Why's he sending us away?
Something's wrong.

169
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:45,116
Everything's going to be fine.
All right? I'm sure of it.

170
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,666
[Soren] What's going on, Father?

171
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:57,305
We have visitors from Xadia...

172
00:14:57,614 --> 00:14:59,885
Unwanted visitors.

173
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,532
What are they, minstrels or something?

174
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:05,879
- [whispering] Assassins.
- I know! What do you think, I'm an idiot?

175
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:08,079
[Claudia grumbles skeptically]

176
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,718
They've set up a secret camp
somewhere near the base of the cliffs.

177
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:13,762
Soren, you will lead an attack.

178
00:15:13,849 --> 00:15:17,046
Right. Their secret camp.

179
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:20,734
How am I supposed to find it
if it's secret?

180
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:24,762
These assassins are Moonshadow elves.

181
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:27,442
They draw power from the Moon.

182
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:33,271
Inside this box is an Archangel Lunaris...
a giant moon moth.

183
00:15:33,358 --> 00:15:35,909
It will be drawn to their energy.

184
00:15:35,996 --> 00:15:39,235
Follow it, and you will find them.

185
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:42,118
And what happens if I can't find them?

186
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:45,491
Then we may be
on the brink of changing times.

187
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:48,345
- You're saying they'll kill the king?
- [Viren shushes]

188
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,295
[Ezran giggling]

189
00:15:57,382 --> 00:15:59,255
Discretion, boy!

190
00:15:59,342 --> 00:16:01,267
- Do you want to cause a panic?
- I'm sorry...

191
00:16:01,354 --> 00:16:05,177
Just get out there and find them.
Before sundown!

192
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:10,485
So, if these are really Moonshadow elves,
then once the moon rises...

193
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:12,953
They'll be unstoppable.

194
00:16:13,064 --> 00:16:15,615
Well, I'm going to find a way
to stop them.

195
00:16:15,702 --> 00:16:19,536
After all, "unstoppable"
is just another kind of "stoppable."

196
00:16:19,623 --> 00:16:21,534
No. That's not really right.

197
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:24,157
Yeah, it made more sense in my head.

198
00:16:31,068 --> 00:16:35,226
Wait, I'm coming with you!

199
00:16:35,476 --> 00:16:37,331
You look terrific.

200
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:41,130
But, just so you know,
that's ceremonial armor.

201
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:45,868
It's three times as heavy
and half as strong. Oh, but so shiny!

202
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:49,997
I don't care. I know what's going on
and I'm coming with you.

203
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:53,982
- You're just a kid, Callum.
- I'll be 15 in two months.

204
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:56,872
Ooh, fourteen and three quarters! Wow!

205
00:16:56,983 --> 00:17:00,094
Five-sixths. Soren, he's our king.

206
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:03,407
And he's my father.
It's my duty to help him.

207
00:17:03,494 --> 00:17:06,840
Well, technically he is your step-dad.

208
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,480
But I'm sure it's similar. Think fast!

209
00:17:10,642 --> 00:17:11,811
[grunts]

210
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:15,852
[sighs] You were supposed to catch it.

211
00:17:30,576 --> 00:17:34,743
[Runaan] Four full moons past,
on the eve of the Winter's Turn,

212
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:39,509
the humans crossed into Xadia
and murdered the King of the Dragons.

213
00:17:39,662 --> 00:17:43,946
Then they destroyed his only egg,
the Dragon Prince.

214
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,325
Tonight we bind our lives to justice!

215
00:17:48,412 --> 00:17:52,266
- [assassin 1] My breath for freedom!
- [assassin 2] My eyes for truth!

216
00:17:52,428 --> 00:17:56,682
- [assassin 3] My strength for honor!
- [assassin 4] My blood for justice!

217
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,685
My heart for Xadia!

218
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,837
Life is precious. Life is valuable.

219
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:10,571
We take it, but we do not take it lightly.

220
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:20,831
Moon reflects sun, as death reflects life!

221
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:36,954
When it is done, I will send a shadowhawk

222
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:40,552
with a blood ribbon message
to the Queen of the Dragons.

223
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:44,188
We strike when the moon is highest!

224
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,151
- Uh, Runaan?
- What is it, Rayla?

225
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:53,189
I was wondering...
what if they know we're coming?

226
00:18:53,276 --> 00:18:55,931
We have the advantage of surprise.

227
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:59,953
If we act fast, we will accomplish
our goals without sacrifice.

228
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:15,969
[Ezran laughs]

229
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:19,640
Oh, Bait, you're terrible
at hide and seek.

230
00:19:21,085 --> 00:19:24,460
- Ez! What are you doing?
- Hi, Callum. Do you want a...

231
00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:26,796
No, I don't want a stupid jelly tart!

232
00:19:26,883 --> 00:19:29,767
Why aren't you packed?
You know we have to get going soon.

233
00:19:29,854 --> 00:19:32,218
But... you're not packed.

234
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,655
What do you think I'm doing?

235
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:35,888
[laughing]

236
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,307
Ezran! You don't get it, do you?

237
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,820
Why do you think they're sending us away?

238
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:43,622
Because they're coming to kill him!

239
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:51,449
[growls]

240
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:53,992
[sighs]

241
00:20:02,793 --> 00:20:07,430
Let's see if this magic moon moth can find
more than a closet full of moon sweaters.

242
00:20:07,517 --> 00:20:08,581
[chuckles]

243
00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:12,583
- You know, 'cause moths eat clothes?
- Yes, sir.

244
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,001
Let's go!

245
00:20:45,753 --> 00:20:47,418
They know we're here!

246
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:49,771
[horse whinnies in distance]

247
00:20:54,095 --> 00:20:56,153
Mystica-Arbora!

248
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:02,895
[neighs]

249
00:21:19,704 --> 00:21:22,077
[scoffs] Nothing!

250
00:21:22,164 --> 00:21:28,018
Surprising no one, a magic moth
is just as worthless as a regular moth.

251
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:35,859
We'll have to wait for the elves
to come to us.

252
00:21:52,653 --> 00:21:54,169
[clicks tongue]

253
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:06,497
You lied to me.

254
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:09,792
- You let him go!
- Runaan, I'm sorry!

255
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:13,765
The human... he looked up at me
and I saw the fear in his eyes.

256
00:22:13,852 --> 00:22:17,607
Of course he was afraid.
But you had a job to do!

257
00:22:17,694 --> 00:22:21,681
He didn't do anything to me!
How could I take his life?

258
00:22:21,768 --> 00:22:23,644
You let him live...

259
00:22:23,731 --> 00:22:26,118
but you've killed us all!
