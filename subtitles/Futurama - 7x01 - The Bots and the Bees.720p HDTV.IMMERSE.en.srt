Crew, as you know,

31
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:37,647
I've delivered a lot
of good news in the past.

32
00:01:37,714 --> 00:01:41,280
But what I'm about
to lay down is by far the greatest 

33
00:01:41,315 --> 00:01:44,320
announcement in

34
00:01:44,388 --> 00:01:46,088

I'm on the edge of my butt!

36
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:52,562
Ladies and gentlemen, feast
your eyes on our amazing new...

37

39
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,204
You undersold it, Professor!

40
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:05,374
Look, it has Slurm Loco!
It's the extremiest!

41
00:02:05,442 --> 00:02:07,310
Hey, what can I get y'all?

42
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,813
Wow, you can talk?
Shut up and give me a Slurm Loco.

43
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:15,418
(carbonation hissing)

44
00:02:15,486 --> 00:02:17,987
Ooh! Ooh!
Hey, drink machine,

45
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,056
what kind of alcoholic
 sodas you got?

46
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:22,925
Y'all can't drink at work!
This ain't a sawmill!

47
00:02:22,993 --> 00:02:24,494
No alcohol?!

48
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,962
(scoffs)
And you got the nerve

49
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:27,697
to call yourself
a beverage machine?!

50
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:29,966
I call myself "Bev."

51
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:32,401
And if you're looking
for a smelly old can of booze,

52
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:33,769
go look in the mirror.

53
00:02:33,837 --> 00:02:35,605
- Oh, snap!
- Oh...!

54
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:38,074
Now, now,
everybody calm down.

55
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:40,476
Yeah, I need one more Slurm.

56
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:47,116
And one more to wash that
Slurm taste out of my mouth.

57
00:02:52,523 --> 00:02:55,391
So I went to the bathroom
and my pee was green.

58
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:56,592
Pretty neat, huh?

59
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,528
I was wondering who
Shrekked in the toilet.

60
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,497
I hope you're proud
of yourself, Bev.

61
00:03:01,565 --> 00:03:05,001
You've turned this perfectly
worthless loser into an addict.

62
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:06,502
Cut me some slack, preacher.

63
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,539
I'm just a coal grinder's daughter
trying to stay off the pole.

64
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:13,342
With that big ol' caboose,
it'd have to be a telephone pole!

65
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,379
Hey-oh!
(laughing)

66
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,314
Well, I guess a fella's
gotta talk big

67
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:20,016
when he's sportin' a little
shriveled-up antenna like that.

68
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,384
What?!

69
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:26,455
For your information, "madam,"
it's a grower, not a show-er!

70

♪

71
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:34,163
My antenna's fine.
It's just fine.

72
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:36,165
Ladies can't get enough Bender.

73
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:39,969
I need to loosen up.
Give me a screwdriver.

74
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:42,538
Hello.
Who's your hot, dumb friend?

75
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:44,206
- Me?
- Me?

76
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:45,241
Sure, why not.

77
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,443

Hang on.
It's too bright in here.

80
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,555
Call me old-fashioned,
but I like a little romance in an orgy.

81
00:03:59,623 --> 00:04:02,158
Let me switch off this weird light.

82
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:03,392
Yow!

83
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,361
Fry, it's 2:00 a.m.

84
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:07,763
What are you doing here
glowing on my skanks?

85
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,999
Just sitting here turning
quarters into urine.

86
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:13,102
We don't gotta put up with this.

87
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,704
We got Poli Sci degrees.

88
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:16,405
Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
Hang on.

89
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:18,307
I'll just politely escort him
to the gutter.

90
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,508
Scram, shiny!

91
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:20,943
(grunts)

92
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,578
All right, how we feelin'?

93
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:25,481
Hot. I could bake
a potato in my cleavage.

94
00:04:25,549 --> 00:04:27,750
Yeah, I need a seltzer.

95
00:04:27,818 --> 00:04:31,621
(sighs) I'd be honored to
purchase you some refreshment.

96
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,756
Uh, hey, drink machine,
you got anything classy

97
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:35,625
for these delicate flowers?

98
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,028
I ain't makin' drinks
for no trashy robo-sluts.

99
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:42,531
Trashy? At least
I don't put out for quarters.

100
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:44,467
(growls)

101
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,535
(both gasping)

102
00:04:46,603 --> 00:04:48,004
Hey!

103
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:50,706
Hey. 
Stop that, drink machine.

104
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:52,575
Stop it, I say.

105
00:04:52,643 --> 00:04:55,011
That's it, we're out of here.

106
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:56,912
Come on.
We'll split a blintz.

107
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,814
Wait, give me a chance
to defend your honor.

108
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,083
And then sully it on the couch.

109
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,622
All right, I've been waiting all
day for an excuse to hit a lady.

110
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,191
You try it,
and I'll bash your face in.

111
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:13,195
Ooh, I'm so scared, No-Arms.

112
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:16,499

(both grunting)

114
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:20,870
You want some of this?

115
00:05:20,937 --> 00:05:24,874
(both grunting)

116
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:27,343
(both moaning)

117
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,311
Ee! Ah!

118
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:31,647
- Oh! Interesting.
- Mmm!

119
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:36,852
Leela: Uh, Fry?

120
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,689
You're glowing like the
Human Torch on prom night.

121
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,791
Shouldn't you be standing
on a rocky coast somewhere

122
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:43,292
preventing shipwrecks?

123
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,327
(all laughing)

124
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:48,330
Nice, hate me because
of the brightness of my skin.

125

(Bev groaning)

126
00:05:53,203 --> 00:05:55,504
You okay, ma'am?
I think your soda water broke.

127
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:57,606

128
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:00,843
(baby cryi)

129
00:06:00,911 --> 00:06:03,946

Bev just had a baby in my cup!

130

(all groaning)

131
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:10,319
- I know, right?
- I better take that.

132
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:15,324
Aw, he's so cute.
Wait. No, he isn't.

133
00:06:15,392 --> 00:06:18,227
He looks like Bender!

134
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,395
(all gasping)

135
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:23,132
Oh, no, no, no.
No way am I that kid's Dad!

136
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,901
Wipe my tiny metal ass!

137
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,269
Aw, crap.

138
00:06:30,344 --> 00:06:32,579
Mama, thirsty! 

139
00:06:32,646 --> 00:06:34,848
Hang on, dumpling.
My milk's coming in.

140
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:42,655
Ugh! In public?

141
00:06:42,723 --> 00:06:44,791
Aw, biscuits!
 I'm a father?!

142
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:48,395
- How did this happen?
- Does this ring a bell?

143
00:06:48,462 --> 00:06:50,196
Are you telling me
the stuff we did in private,

144
00:06:50,264 --> 00:06:54,267
and also twice on the sidewalk,
made a baby robot? How?!

145
00:06:54,335 --> 00:06:56,803
Aw, Bender,
didn't your mom ever tell you

146
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:58,338
where robot babies come from?

147
00:06:58,406 --> 00:07:01,041
No. She was a religious
fundamentalist.

148
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:04,344
Plus she didn't have a mouth.
It's an unusual combination.

149
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:08,048
Come on, everyone, let's
take Bender to the teen center

150
00:07:08,115 --> 00:07:10,984
to learn about the
bots and the bees!

151
00:07:13,854 --> 00:07:16,056
Leela: It's okay, Bender.

152
00:07:16,123 --> 00:07:17,457
No one here will laugh at you

153
00:07:17,525 --> 00:07:19,859
for not knowing where
robot babies come from.

We don't know either.

157

is a by-product</i>

163
00:07:41,182 --> 00:07:43,650
<i>of his hardware gearing up</i>

164
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:46,252
<i>for an important mission:
reproduction.</i>

165
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,121
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

166
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:51,057
<i>Since factories can't
manufacture enough robots</i>

167
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,627
<i>to meet demand, robots
can also reproduce by mating.</i>

168
00:07:54,695 --> 00:07:56,296
Oh, now you tell me!

169
00:07:56,363 --> 00:07:59,699
<i>First, Gerald must find
a female robot.</i>

170
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:01,167
<i>The best he can do is Francine.</i>

171
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:03,069
(buzzer sounds)

172
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:06,272
<i>After beer and hot wings
at a local gas station,</i>

173
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,210
<i>the two enjoy intimate
time behind a Dumpster.</i>

174
00:08:10,277 --> 00:08:12,345
<i>(dog barking)
It's all perfectly natural.</i>

175
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:16,049
<i>Let's watch, aroused,
as Gerald's antenna uploads</i>

176
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:19,219
<i>a binary file to
Francine's internal drive.</i>

177
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:24,582
<i>Manufacturing specs from each
parent are then merged</i>

178
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,985
<i>by a randomized algorithm,</i>

179
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:30,822
<i>and the resulting code
guides assembly of a new robot.</i>

180
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,791
(blows raspberry)

181
00:08:32,858 --> 00:08:36,227
<i>Yes, everything your body
does is perfectly natural.</i>

182
00:08:36,295 --> 00:08:40,165
<i>Except masturbation.
That's just wrong.</i>

183
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:44,436
Oh! I can't believe
I made a kid!

184
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:46,271
I'm not ready!

185
00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:47,872
There's so much of the world
I haven't stolen yet!

186
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,776
Relax, Bender. No one
would let you near a child.

187
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:54,045
Bev will get custody, and
you'll be a deadbeat Dad

188
00:08:54,113 --> 00:08:56,614
who never even bothers
to know his own son.

189
00:08:56,682 --> 00:08:58,750
(sniffles):
You really think so?

190
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:02,387
I know so. You're absolutely
horrible in every way.

191
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:04,389
You're sweet, Leela.

192
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:08,993
(giggling)

193
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:13,072
Sorry, Bev, but I ain't
cut out for fatherhood.

194
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,643
So here's my certificate of
abandonment drawn up by our notary!

195
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,077
That'll be ten bucks.

196
00:09:18,145 --> 00:09:20,413
Now take your kid
and hit the soup line!

197
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:21,848
(laughs)

198
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,950
(sobs):
Oh, no, you don't, mister!

199
00:09:24,018 --> 00:09:26,386
Damn baby's drivin' me crazy!

200
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:28,555
(giggling)
He won't stop giggling

201
00:09:28,622 --> 00:09:30,890
no matter how much
I scream at him!

202
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,825
(sobbing)

203
00:09:32,893 --> 00:09:34,360
There, there.

204
00:09:36,263 --> 00:09:38,264
I still got womanly needs!

205
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:39,866
Who's gonna look twice at me

206
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:42,502
with this dirty leech
hangin' off my dairy nozzle?

207
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,870
Not me, that's for sure.

208
00:09:43,938 --> 00:09:46,539
Then it's settled!
He's all yours, Pappy!

209
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:49,943
Hey, wait! You can't...!
What?!

210
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,979
(crying)

211
00:09:54,648 --> 00:09:58,384
Ah... Ah!

212
00:09:58,452 --> 00:10:00,386
(both crying)

213
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,427
(baby crying)

214
00:10:11,398 --> 00:10:13,266
(crying fades)

215
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:18,204
(soft snoring)

216
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:19,239
(sighs)

217
00:10:22,843 --> 00:10:23,943
(loud crying)

218
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:25,445
What the...?!

219
00:10:25,513 --> 00:10:27,514
Aw, can't I have 
one moment to myself?!

220
00:10:29,183 --> 00:10:30,517
Why can't you sleep?

221
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:33,052
I left my window open,
and moths got in.

222
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,688
I swear, if I wasn't
such a great Dad,

223
00:10:35,756 --> 00:10:38,525
I'd grab his ugly
little neck and... (grunts)

224
00:10:38,592 --> 00:10:41,528
(giggles)

225
00:10:41,595 --> 00:10:43,630
Hey, he stopped screaming
for a second!

226
00:10:43,697 --> 00:10:45,498
Bend some other stuff!

227
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,402
(laughs)

228
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,204
(loud crack,
Fry screams)

229
00:10:51,272 --> 00:10:52,505
Ben'! Ben'!

230
00:10:52,573 --> 00:10:54,707
He loves bending,
just like me.

231
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:57,210
Aw, I'm gonna call him Ben...

232
00:10:57,278 --> 00:10:59,612
after the first half
of me... Bender.

233
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,947
(burps)

234
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:02,282
That's my bastard!

235
00:11:12,326 --> 00:11:14,093
(wheel squeaking)

236
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:19,065
(grunting and panting)

237
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:22,035
(grunting)

238
00:11:24,405 --> 00:11:25,505
(alarm sounds)

239
00:11:25,573 --> 00:11:27,807
(giggles)

240
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,709
(both laughing)

241
00:11:29,777 --> 00:11:31,277
(gunshots)
Uh, oh!

242
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:32,512
(laughing)

243
00:11:34,273 --> 00:11:35,673
Bend it, Daddy!

244
00:11:35,741 --> 00:11:37,041
Bend it like it called you
poo-poo-face!

245
00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:38,743
It called me what?!

246
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:41,212
(intense grunting)

247
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,748
Yay! You bended it
like a "petzel."

248
00:11:45,217 --> 00:11:47,118
Okay, now you.

249
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:51,089
(grunts)

250
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:53,992
I can't do it!

251
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:56,761
Hey, buddy, you're learning.
You'll get there.

252
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:58,563
Bender, I was wrong.

253
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:00,598
You're a fine parent,
and I want to apolo...

254
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,066
- Leela was wrong!
- Leela was wrong!

255
00:12:02,134 --> 00:12:03,301
- Leela was wrong!
- Leela was wrong!

256
00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:06,171
(both laughing)

257
00:12:06,238 --> 00:12:08,740
Daddy, how'd you get
so good at bending?

258
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:11,643
I inherited my arm control
software from my mom.

259
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,145
That's how it's passed down,
mother to son.

260
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:17,015
But my mommy had no arms!

261
00:12:17,082 --> 00:12:19,384
Does that mean
I can never be a bender?

262
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:23,721
Well, sure you can! You just need
to get a bending card installed.

263
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:26,991
I hate to crush a boy's
dreams, but what the heck.

264
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:31,462
He has only one expansion slot,
and it holds his memory card.

265
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:35,033
This robot will never bend.

266
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,436
Don't tell my son
what he can and can't do!

267
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:40,138
You may know
what's in his head,

268
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:41,739
but you don't know
what's in his heart!

269
00:12:41,807 --> 00:12:45,710
- There's no slot in there either.
- I said shut up!

270
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:53,918
<i>Today marks young Ben's</i>

271
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:57,488
<i>13th day of being
left on continuously.</i>

272
00:12:57,556 --> 00:13:01,626
<i>And so, before the Lord
and this congregation,</i>

273
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:06,764
we upgrade him to man-bot.
Can I get a mazel tov?

274
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:07,966
All: Mazel tov!

275
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:09,434
(gurgling):
Mazel tov!

276
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:12,620
I'd like to thank the
Preacherbot for the introduction

277
00:13:12,621 --> 00:13:15,740
and also for not circumcising
me again, am I right?

278
00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:17,342
(scattered chuckles)

279
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:20,445
Twice was enough.
But seriously...

280
00:13:20,512 --> 00:13:24,882
today, I'm not just a manbot,
I'm the luckiest manbot alive.

281
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,252
My mom may have abandoned me,

282
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:30,688
but I have the greatest Dad
in the whole universe.

283
00:13:30,756 --> 00:13:33,524
He's patient, he's not afraid
to show his emotions...

284
00:13:33,592 --> 00:13:35,660
Don't look at me!

285
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:38,429
...and someday,
if my dreams come true,

286
00:13:38,497 --> 00:13:40,531
I'll be a bender, just like him.

287
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:43,368
You must be so proud of your boy.

288
00:13:43,435 --> 00:13:45,270
(sniffs) I could take him
or leave him.

289
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:49,440
I'm back for my son!

290
00:13:49,508 --> 00:13:52,210
I've come to take him
and leave with him!

291
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:54,679
(congregation gasps)
She beat you to both things.

292
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:01,504
It's okay, son,
mama's here now. 

293
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:04,274
Daddy!
Don't let her take me!

294
00:14:04,341 --> 00:14:06,342
Get your lack of hands
off my boy!

295
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,112
You're an unfit parent
who abandoned her child!

296
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,582
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm still
less unfitter than you.

297
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,918
- Says who?!
- Says this document you gave me

298
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:17,153
when you tried
to abandon Ben first!

299
00:14:17,221 --> 00:14:19,389
(straining grunt)

300
00:14:19,456 --> 00:14:21,457
It's genuine.

301
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:23,026
(all gasping)

302
00:14:23,093 --> 00:14:25,195
That doesn't prove
I'm an unfit parent!

303
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:27,263
I was drunk and violent
when I signed that!

304
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:30,633
Well, I'm drunk and violent now.
He's comin' with me!

305
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:33,369
Daddy...! (sobs)

306
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:36,339
(sobbing): Son...!

307
00:14:40,277 --> 00:14:43,479
My boy's gone.
All I have left to remember him

308
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:45,848
are these innocent play
things we stole together.

309
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,850
(monkey chitters)
(sniffles)

310
00:14:47,918 --> 00:14:50,620
Fry, put these someplace safe.

311
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:52,689
(sizzling, monkey shrieks)

312
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:54,557
(sobbing)

313
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,993
That's it, Fry!
For a guy who's not too bright,

314
00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:58,895
you're too damn bright!

315
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:00,663
Now, get out!
And don't come back

316
00:15:00,731 --> 00:15:04,000
until someone finds
a use for a million-watt idiot!

317
00:15:06,237 --> 00:15:08,838
(crying)

318
00:15:12,977 --> 00:15:15,212
(electrical crackling)

319
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,681
Mom, will I ever get
to see Dad again?

320
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:21,351
No, he died yesterday.
Rust monsters ate his face.

321
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:23,053
Sweet dreams!

322
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,793
(whimpering)

323
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:31,428
<i>(tapping on glass)
Bender: Psst!</i>

324
00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:33,897
<i>Quit whimpering or you
don't get kidnapped!</i>

325
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:35,899
Dad!
(grunts)

326
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:37,768
(moaning and whimpering)

327
00:15:37,835 --> 00:15:40,570
Ah... Come on.
Let's run for it.

328
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:42,139
(both panting)

329
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:43,573
(both moaning)

330
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:44,775
(both panting)

331
00:15:50,815 --> 00:15:52,983
What's going to happen
to us now, Dad?

332
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,852
Well, I reckon we'll just sit
around this campfire awhile.

333
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,555
- But then what?
- Only a fool plans

334
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:00,690
more than a few
centuries ahead, son.

335
00:16:00,758 --> 00:16:02,325
(helicopter blades whirring)
(both scream)

336
00:16:02,393 --> 00:16:04,261
<i>Url: Freeze, tin woodsmen!</i>

337
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:06,296
<i>Smitty: You're under
arrest for kidnapping</i>

338
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:08,431
<i>and burning raccoons
without a permit!</i>

339
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:09,933
(both scream)

340
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:16,273
(shouts)

341
00:16:18,176 --> 00:16:20,277
It's over, Dad.
It ain't over!

342
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:24,047
I can't outrun a hovercopter,
but I can out-bend it!

343
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:27,250
(grunts)

344
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:29,286
(grunting continues)

345
00:16:32,723 --> 00:16:34,558
(Bender screams)

346
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,327
I know!
Let's outrun it!

347
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:42,899
<i>Bender: There's a dam!</i>

348
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:44,935
- Damn!
- There's a grate!

349
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:47,137
- Ben: Great!
- But I can't bend anything

350
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:49,940
with my arms agonizingly
maimed like this.

351
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:51,341
Well, maybe I can!

352
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:52,843
(exaggerated gasp)

353
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,947
(grunts)

354
00:16:57,014 --> 00:16:58,682
You can do it, son.

355
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:05,021
(grunts)

356
00:17:08,642 --> 00:17:11,444
Yeah, this ain't gonna happen.

357
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:13,780
Is that even necessary?

358
00:17:16,517 --> 00:17:18,351
I'm sorry, Daddy.

359
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,153
You got nothing to be sorry about.

360
00:17:20,221 --> 00:17:22,822
(whispers)
He's really a very good father.

361
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:27,494
All right, I got her statement.
And a straight up grape soda.

362
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:29,963
(slurps)
Aw, yeah.

363
00:17:30,031 --> 00:17:32,399
I promise things will
be different, son.

364
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:35,735
From now on, I'm chaining
you to a radiator.

365
00:17:35,803 --> 00:17:38,538
I'm amazed someone who
dispenses such warm soda,

366
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:40,540
could be so coldhearted!

367
00:17:40,608 --> 00:17:43,843
I'm gonna buy a drink just so
I can throw it in your face!

368
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:48,314
(gasps)
It's another soda baby!

369
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:49,649
(all gasping)

370
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:51,251
Damn.

371
00:17:54,221 --> 00:17:56,222
You got knocked up
by a police officer

372
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,358
while he was looking for
your kidnapped child?

373
00:17:58,426 --> 00:18:00,960
Sure did!
I still got it.

374
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:02,429
So, now what happens?

375
00:18:02,496 --> 00:18:04,531
Tell you what,
you keep the big one.

376
00:18:04,598 --> 00:18:07,367
Long as I got a baby
to neglect, I'm happy.

377
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:09,335
Should we call child services?

378
00:18:09,403 --> 00:18:11,271
Nah, let's just get outta here.

379
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:16,443
(whooping)

380
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,312
(whooping)

381
00:18:21,382 --> 00:18:23,383
- Whoo?
- Sorry, Dad.

382
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:25,218
I'm glad to be back.

383
00:18:25,286 --> 00:18:27,554
I'm just kind of bummed
I can't bend stuff.

384
00:18:27,621 --> 00:18:30,757
All I ever wanted was to go
to Bending State-Santa Cruz.

385
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:32,959
But that's never gonna happen.

386
00:18:33,027 --> 00:18:36,796
Listen, you need something bent,
you come to me, huh, champ?

387
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:45,438
Damn it, I love that
little guy so much!

388
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:49,667
I'd sacrifice any four of you if it
would help him bend even a little!

389
00:18:50,055 --> 00:18:53,313
There is one way...
but no, it's too horrible.

390
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,548
Nothing's too horrible
for my boy!

391
00:18:55,616 --> 00:18:59,219
Well... I could install
a bending card.

392
00:18:59,286 --> 00:19:01,221
But you said he only has one slot!

393
00:19:01,288 --> 00:19:04,124
Correct. I'd have to
remove his memory card.

394
00:19:04,191 --> 00:19:07,427
He'd be able to bend, 
but he'd lose all his memories.

395
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:10,396
He wouldn't even
remember who you are.

396
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:16,803
(grunts)

397
00:19:24,011 --> 00:19:26,112
You sure you want
to be a bender, son?

398
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,614
More than anything.

399
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,352
Just remember,
your Daddy loves you.

400
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:36,990
Remember that, will you, son?
Remember that. (sobs)

401
00:19:37,057 --> 00:19:38,858
Dad, are you crying?

402
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:40,460
(marker squeaks)

403
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:43,796
No! I said with the
mouth you're looking at.

404
00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:55,041
(grunts)

405
00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:58,011
(whistles) You sure
take after your old man!

406
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,133
I never knew my father.

407
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,535
(squeaks)
It's not important.

408
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:04,937
What is important
is that we get you

409
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:07,540
to Bending State-Santa Cruz
in time for registration.

410
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:10,443
Then we'd better hurry!
Registration ends in one hour.

411
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:11,511
To the ship!

412
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,550
(sighs)
It's too foggy.

413
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:19,452
We can't navigate through this storm.

414
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,220
Our lights aren't bright enough.

415
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:25,091
- I'm sorry I let you down, son.
- Who are you again?

416
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:27,794
It's just not possible to get
you to bending school this year.

417
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:29,162
(door whooshes open)

418
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,430
Or is there?

419
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:32,665
(gulps, exhales)

420
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:44,077
<i>(all cheering): All right, Fry!</i>

421
00:20:44,144 --> 00:20:47,580
Merry college
registration day, everyone!
