1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:03,049
Earth...

2
00:00:03,051 --> 00:00:04,317
Fire...

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,985
Air...

4
00:00:05,987 --> 00:00:07,953
Water.

5
00:00:07,955 --> 00:00:12,057
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,226
and bring balance to the world.

8
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:23,001
Tensions between the Northern
and Southern water tribes

9
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:24,604
have reached a breaking point.

10
00:00:24,606 --> 00:00:27,474
After chief Unalaq's troops
took over the South,

11
00:00:27,476 --> 00:00:29,143
varrick incited an uprising.

12
00:00:29,145 --> 00:00:32,111
But Korra stopped the rebels
from abducting her uncle.

13
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:33,513
Enraged by the insurrection,

14
00:00:33,515 --> 00:00:35,848
Unalaq arrested the rebels
and Korra's parents,

15
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,851
accusing them of conspiring
to assassinate him.

16
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:40,386
Will Korra be able
to save her parents

17
00:00:40,388 --> 00:00:42,121
and prevent civil war?

18
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:02,541
You're making a mistake.

19
00:01:02,543 --> 00:01:04,176
I wish it hadn't come to this.

20
00:01:04,178 --> 00:01:05,944
But your parents held meetings
with the rebels,

21
00:01:05,946 --> 00:01:07,412
right here in their home.

22
00:01:07,414 --> 00:01:09,781
I can't believe you're doing
this to your own family.

23
00:01:09,783 --> 00:01:12,317
Rest assured,
I've appointed judge hotah

24
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,652
to oversee the trial.

25
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:16,388
He is the most fair
and honorable man I know.

26
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,423
Uncle, my parents
had nothing to do

27
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:19,524
with the men who attacked you.

28
00:01:19,526 --> 00:01:20,859
I'm sure you're right.

29
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:24,230
So we should have nothing
to worry about.

30
00:01:24,232 --> 00:01:26,198
I hope so.

31
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:33,939
Where's varrick?

32
00:01:33,941 --> 00:01:36,041
We should've closed our deal
an hour ago.

33
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:38,777
Would you relax?
This place is great.

34
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:42,047
And the best part about it?
Eska doesn't know I'm here.

35
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:46,351
Eeyah.

36
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:47,486
I wasn't hiding.

37
00:01:47,488 --> 00:01:49,021
Hey, hey-hey, hey.

38
00:01:49,023 --> 00:01:50,989
I'm not on the hunt for you.

39
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:52,624
Currently.

40
00:01:52,626 --> 00:01:54,092
We search for varrick.

41
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:56,361
Our father wishes him
to stand trial.

42
00:01:56,363 --> 00:01:57,796
What did he do?

43
00:01:57,798 --> 00:01:59,297
He is a traitor
to the water tribe,

44
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:01,066
along with our aunt and uncle.

45
00:02:01,068 --> 00:02:03,435
- What?
- Korra's parents were arrested?

46
00:02:03,437 --> 00:02:07,072
Yes. Your powers of deduction
are impressive.

47
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:08,473
Yeah, he's a cop.

48
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:09,475
Varrick's not here.

49
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:10,676
Very well.

50
00:02:10,678 --> 00:02:14,314
Desna, let us continue
our search elsewhere.

51
00:02:14,316 --> 00:02:16,483
Boyfriend!
Bow to me when I exit.

52
00:02:16,485 --> 00:02:19,919
Yes, yes,
my sweet koala-otter.

53
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:23,756
You are so cute
when you grovel.

54
00:02:24,926 --> 00:02:26,326
Don't let her treat you
that way.

55
00:02:26,328 --> 00:02:27,794
Stand up for yourself.

56
00:02:27,796 --> 00:02:29,362
I tried to break up with her,

57
00:02:29,364 --> 00:02:31,664
but Mako gave me
terrible advice.

58
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:32,899
Thank you, Mako.

59
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:34,934
Wait, how are your girl
problems my fault?

60
00:02:34,936 --> 00:02:37,504
Bolin, you need to be honest
with her.

61
00:02:37,506 --> 00:02:39,240
Tell her how you really feel.

62
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,342
Honesty is for fools, kid!

63
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:42,810
Varrick?

64
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:44,145
If you want
to ditch this girl,

65
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:45,780
then make yourself scarce.

66
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:47,315
Disappear, like I did!

67
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:48,650
Where are you?

68
00:02:48,652 --> 00:02:51,086
Somewhere
Unalaq will never find me.

69
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,489
Inside ping-ping!

70
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:55,290
How we doin'?

71
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:56,324
The coast is clear.

72
00:02:56,326 --> 00:02:57,359
You can come out.

73
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:58,560
No way, mister.

74
00:02:58,562 --> 00:03:03,966
Not until I know
it's absolutely, 157% safe.

75
00:03:03,968 --> 00:03:05,868
Ahh! Thank you, Zhu li.

76
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,570
Your assistant's in there too?

77
00:03:07,572 --> 00:03:10,139
Zhu li never leaves my side.

78
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:14,243
Yuck!
Pyugh! Pyuck!

79
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:15,411
You forgot the honey!

80
00:03:15,413 --> 00:03:16,445
Sorry, sir.

81
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:17,846
There isn't any in here.

82
00:03:17,848 --> 00:03:19,215
No honey?

83
00:03:19,217 --> 00:03:22,085
We're in a bear,
for crying out loud!

84
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:24,287
I'm gonna go see
how Korra's doing.

85
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:28,225
Bolin, I got a little
something for you 'round back.

86
00:03:31,363 --> 00:03:32,864
Wow!

87
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:35,366
Now listen up.

88
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:38,135
Unalaq's rigged this trial,
no doubt about it.

89
00:03:38,137 --> 00:03:39,203
So I need you to make sure

90
00:03:39,205 --> 00:03:41,172
my trusty rebels
stay out of prison.

91
00:03:41,174 --> 00:03:42,339
What's the money for?

92
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:43,741
Bribery, of course!

93
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:45,910
There's always someone willing
to look the other way

94
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:47,144
for a few yuans.

95
00:03:47,146 --> 00:03:52,684
I think I catch your drift,
varrick-bear.

96
00:03:55,687 --> 00:03:58,355
Ikki!

97
00:03:58,357 --> 00:04:00,224
Ikki, where are you?

98
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:01,224
Shoo!

99
00:04:01,226 --> 00:04:03,894
Go bother someone else.

100
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:06,229
You two are worse
than Kya and Bumi.

101
00:04:06,231 --> 00:04:07,897
Okay, everybody here?

102
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:09,131
Ikki!

103
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:10,366
Oh, thank goodness.

104
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,202
Juniper lightning bug,
paws off the table!

105
00:04:13,204 --> 00:04:17,073
This is going to be
a civilized breakfast.

106
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:19,909
Daddy always says a blessing
before we eat, so...

107
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:21,778
be quiet and listen up!

108
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:26,548
We are thankful
for this super yummy food

109
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,550
and for being the best-est
new friends in the world.

110
00:04:28,552 --> 00:04:29,684
But we are most thankful

111
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,987
because meelo and Jinora
aren't here

112
00:04:31,989 --> 00:04:35,223
because they stink.

113
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,959
Oh!

114
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:39,260
Hi, daddy.

115
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:40,395
I guess you found me.

116
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:42,531
Do I have to go now?

117
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:45,234
Actually, is there room
for one more?

118
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:47,003
Uh, sure.

119
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:51,241
You can sit
next to blueberry spicehead.

120
00:04:51,243 --> 00:04:53,743
Nice to meet you,
blueberry spicehead.

121
00:04:53,745 --> 00:04:55,177
And that's princess rainbow,

122
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:56,345
and that's twinkle starchild.

123
00:04:56,347 --> 00:04:57,813
And that's
juniper lightning bug.

124
00:04:57,815 --> 00:04:59,348
They're my new brothers
and sisters.

125
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,882
New ones, huh?

126
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:04,019
Can they be my new brothers
and sisters too?

127
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:07,756
Maybe, but only
if they say it's okay.

128
00:05:07,758 --> 00:05:09,557
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

129
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,026
No, no, he's nice.

130
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:12,694
They say it's okay.

131
00:05:30,044 --> 00:05:31,177
We're good to go.

132
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:32,445
I gave all the money
to some guys over there.

133
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:34,614
I told them
to "take care of it,"

134
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:35,782
and then I winked.

135
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:38,585
Pretty sure
they got the message.

136
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,594
This trial
will now come to order!

137
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,397
Judge hotah presiding.

138
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:52,033
Man! I should have paid him!

139
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:54,168
Yeah, you think?

140
00:05:55,904 --> 00:05:59,006
I was asleep in my chambers
when the rebels attacked.

141
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:00,407
They overpowered me,

142
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:03,043
and the next thing I remember
was waking up in the snow

143
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:06,580
after Avatar Korra had saved me.

144
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:08,581
According
to Unalaq's testimony,

145
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:09,983
you attended a meeting

146
00:06:09,985 --> 00:06:12,084
where varrick tried to incite
a civil war.

147
00:06:12,086 --> 00:06:14,186
Is that true?
Yes.

148
00:06:14,188 --> 00:06:16,489
And were these men present
at that meeting?

149
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:18,957
Well, yes, but...

150
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,727
and where exactly
did this meeting take place?

151
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:22,961
Objection!

152
00:06:22,963 --> 00:06:25,530
Quiet down out there!

153
00:06:25,532 --> 00:06:27,465
I'll ask you one more time.

154
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:29,968
Where did the meeting happen?

155
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,071
My parents' house.

156
00:06:32,073 --> 00:06:33,839
And who led this meeting?

157
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:35,774
Your honor, if I may...

158
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:37,008
May what?

159
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,478
May I... Declare a mistrial?

160
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,681
Sit down.

161
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:46,317
Varrick and your father
led the meeting, didn't they?

162
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,918
My parents are innocent!

163
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,787
I've heard all I need to.

164
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:53,224
I'll return shortly
with my decision.

165
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:02,400
Hey there, Eska!

166
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:05,036
I was wondering
if we could talk.

167
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:06,838
I grant you permission
to speak freely.

168
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,107
Oh, good, because I just
need to be honest with you.

169
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:12,409
You know, when we first met,
there was this crazy spark.

170
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:17,114
But I'm starting to feel
like that spark is fading.

171
00:07:17,116 --> 00:07:18,382
I agree.

172
00:07:18,384 --> 00:07:20,751
It is as if a great chasm
has formed between us

173
00:07:20,753 --> 00:07:21,986
and nothing can bridge it.

174
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:23,687
Oh! Oh, yes!

175
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:26,223
I am so glad you understand!

176
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:28,459
Nothing, that is,
except marriage.

177
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:33,231
We will wed at sunset.

178
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:35,566
You may express your joy
through tears.

179
00:07:37,503 --> 00:07:38,769
Oh, no, I can't...

180
00:07:38,771 --> 00:07:41,172
This is really tight.

181
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,542
Senna, please step forward.

182
00:07:47,912 --> 00:07:50,080
I have found you innocent.

183
00:07:50,082 --> 00:07:51,482
You are free to go.

184
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:53,720
Korra!

185
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,091
On the charge of treason,

186
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:02,260
you are all found guilty.

187
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:08,200
The punishment for this crime
is death.

188
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:22,489
You can't do this!

189
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:25,125
You take their lives,
and I'll take yours.

190
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:26,993
Korra, calm down.

191
00:08:26,995 --> 00:08:28,628
I'll talk to him.

192
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,236
I know I promised to respect
whatever decision you made,

193
00:08:35,238 --> 00:08:37,605
but I must ask you
to reconsider.

194
00:08:37,607 --> 00:08:41,708
Show these men
and my brother mercy.

195
00:08:44,212 --> 00:08:45,345
Very well.

196
00:08:45,347 --> 00:08:47,481
I'll change their punishment.

197
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:49,349
Your lives will be spared.

198
00:08:49,351 --> 00:08:51,284
But you will live them out
in prison.

199
00:08:59,827 --> 00:09:02,329
Thank you, Uncle.

200
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,971
You like that, don't you,
blueberry spicehead?

201
00:09:10,973 --> 00:09:12,439
Yes, you do.

202
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:16,076
You know, I could get
used to it here.

203
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:19,513
No one's yelling at me
or telling me I'm delusional.

204
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:21,649
We should have Uncle Bumi
and aunt Kya come visit.

205
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:23,217
I bet they'd like it too.

206
00:09:23,219 --> 00:09:24,351
Let's not.

207
00:09:24,353 --> 00:09:26,253
They'll only spoil
our good mood.

208
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:27,287
What do you mean?

209
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:29,289
Aunt Kya is super nice
and pretty

210
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,858
and always asks me
how I'm feeling?

211
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,793
And Uncle Bumi is, like,
the funniest person

212
00:09:32,795 --> 00:09:34,094
in the world.

213
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:35,296
But what about meelo?

214
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:37,198
He's hilarious too.

215
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,400
You never know what's
going to come out of his mouth.

216
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:42,570
And Jinora can be so sweet
and gentle.

217
00:09:42,572 --> 00:09:44,005
And mean.

218
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:46,240
And bossy.

219
00:09:46,242 --> 00:09:49,777
Being part of a family
is hard, huh, daddy?

220
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:51,746
I couldn't agree with you more.

221
00:10:03,924 --> 00:10:06,125
But I guess the nice part
about a family

222
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:08,160
is they'll always be there
for you.

223
00:10:08,162 --> 00:10:10,695
Even though twinkle starchild
and princess rainbow fight,

224
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:12,430
they still love each other.

225
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:14,699
That's very wise of you, ikki.

226
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:17,001
We should probably
head back, huh?

227
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:18,135
I suppose.

228
00:10:18,137 --> 00:10:21,940
We can't hide
in this cave forever.

229
00:10:21,942 --> 00:10:23,242
Don't worry, daddy.

230
00:10:23,244 --> 00:10:25,110
We'll come back
and visit blueberry spicehead.

231
00:10:25,112 --> 00:10:26,946
I know you really bonded
with her.

232
00:10:26,948 --> 00:10:29,582
Yes, I'd like that.

233
00:10:36,924 --> 00:10:39,458
Honey, are you all right?
I'm fine.

234
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,060
Good, then let's bust you
out of here right now.

235
00:10:42,062 --> 00:10:43,228
Korra, no.

236
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,665
Saving me would start a war.

237
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:48,068
If fighting were to break out,
the north would crush the South.

238
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,770
I'll be all right.

239
00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:52,573
Just promise me
you won't do anything rash.

240
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:54,608
Fine.

241
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,143
I promise.

242
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:11,058
It's okay, mom.

243
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,929
II hate feeling so helpless.

244
00:11:14,931 --> 00:11:17,865
I know.

245
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:44,960
Oh!

246
00:11:49,698 --> 00:11:51,365
Oh!

247
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,604
What do you want?

248
00:11:56,606 --> 00:11:58,172
It's not about what I want.

249
00:11:58,174 --> 00:11:59,806
It's about what Naga wants.

250
00:11:59,808 --> 00:12:02,476
And she'd like you
to let my father out of prison.

251
00:12:02,478 --> 00:12:05,011
I... I'm sorry,
but there's nothing I can do.

252
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:07,447
I was just following
Unalaq's orders.

253
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:08,548
What are you talking about?

254
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,550
I... I've said too much.

255
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:13,920
Unless you wanna be
Naga's afternoon snack,

256
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:15,421
you better keep talking.

257
00:12:15,423 --> 00:12:17,757
I... I've worked for your Uncle
for years!

258
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:20,793
He said he needed everyone
to think the trial was fair.

259
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:23,163
So Unalaq told you what to say?

260
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:24,698
Yes! Every word.

261
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,867
Then why did he have you
free my mother

262
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:28,035
and change your sentence?

263
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:29,736
He's trying to keep you
on his side.

264
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:31,771
But he also wants your father
out of the way.

265
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:33,906
Just like when
he got your father banished.

266
00:12:33,908 --> 00:12:37,009
What do you mean
"he got my father banished"?

267
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:38,578
Nothing!

268
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,114
Keep talking.

269
00:12:46,054 --> 00:12:47,921
Uh...

270
00:12:47,923 --> 00:12:49,724
Hey there, dad.

271
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:52,160
You're looking well.

272
00:12:54,664 --> 00:12:56,464
Look, uh, I'm sorry

273
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:59,033
I didn't turn out to be
an airbender like you hoped,

274
00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:02,569
but I've tried my best
to keep the world safe.

275
00:13:02,571 --> 00:13:04,138
Hope I made you proud.

276
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,441
Of course he'd be proud
of you, Bumi.

277
00:13:07,443 --> 00:13:10,111
Kya! I-I was just, uh...

278
00:13:10,113 --> 00:13:11,512
Cleaning off dad's statue.

279
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:14,382
It's so dusty in here.

280
00:13:14,384 --> 00:13:17,252
Come here.

281
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,553
Thanks, Kya.

282
00:13:18,555 --> 00:13:21,689
You always know
when I need a hug.

283
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:25,960
Unalaq's a liar and a traitor!

284
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:27,595
I've been trying
to tell you that

285
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:28,596
from the get-go.

286
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:29,964
What happened?

287
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:31,899
I found out the truth
about my dad's banishment.

288
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:34,902
Unalaq hired the barbarians
to attack their tribe.

289
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:37,138
Then he told them to hide
in the spirit forest,

290
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,006
knowing my dad
would go after them.

291
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:41,209
Unalaq wanted your dad
out of the way

292
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:42,977
so he could become chief.

293
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:44,379
It was a setup.

294
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:46,014
Just like the whole trial.

295
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:48,850
I can't believe I trusted him.

296
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:50,819
I'm busting my father
and the rebels out of jail.

297
00:13:50,821 --> 00:13:52,554
I need your help.

298
00:13:52,556 --> 00:13:55,457
If you do this,
there's no going back.

299
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,525
I know.

300
00:13:56,527 --> 00:13:58,293
Will you help me or not?

301
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,162
- Of course, I'll help.
- Me too.

302
00:14:00,164 --> 00:14:01,797
Count me in!

303
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,607
I don't even want to know.

304
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:12,843
So I'm guessing the breakup
with Eska didn't go well?

305
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:15,012
No, no, the honesty thing
worked out great.

306
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:18,148
So great that she decided
we should get married!

307
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,149
Sorry.

308
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:20,283
I'm pretty sure

309
00:14:20,285 --> 00:14:22,184
the guy
is supposed to give the girl

310
00:14:22,186 --> 00:14:23,318
the betrothal necklace.

311
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,687
I guess Eska
didn't get the memo.

312
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:28,090
Look, the only way
to deal with crazy women

313
00:14:28,092 --> 00:14:29,759
is to lie big and leave fast.

314
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:31,761
Lucky for you,
Varrick's got your back.

315
00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:33,696
Now gather 'round ping-ping.

316
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:35,598
Let's talk plan.

317
00:14:51,581 --> 00:14:52,514
My dad's in there.

318
00:14:54,551 --> 00:14:55,551
Where is he?

319
00:14:55,553 --> 00:14:57,287
I'm sorry, Korra.

320
00:14:57,289 --> 00:15:00,424
You'll never see
your father again.

321
00:15:08,932 --> 00:15:10,799
Where's my father?

322
00:15:10,801 --> 00:15:13,269
On a ship headed
to the northern tribe.

323
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:14,903
He'll serve out
his sentence there.

324
00:15:14,905 --> 00:15:16,238
Bring him back

325
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,540
or I'm taking you out
and the rest of your army.

326
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,909
Remember who you are.

327
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:22,678
As the Avatar,
you cannot threaten war.

328
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,780
You must remain neutral,

329
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:26,716
or our tribes
will never find unity.

330
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,152
You don't want unity.

331
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:29,720
You want power.

332
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:32,689
You've always been jealous
of my father, haven't you?

333
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:34,925
You got him banished
so you could become chief,

334
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:36,760
and I bet it just killed you

335
00:15:36,762 --> 00:15:39,129
to learn he was
the Avatar's father.

336
00:15:39,131 --> 00:15:41,800
No wonder you kept trying
to take me away from him.

337
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:45,136
All I've ever wanted is to
help you realize your destiny.

338
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:47,905
Well, I don't want your help
anymore.

339
00:15:47,907 --> 00:15:49,273
If you start a war,

340
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:51,442
the dark spirits
will annihilate the South.

341
00:15:51,444 --> 00:15:53,912
And even I will be powerless
to stop them.

342
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:55,914
I'm done being manipulated
by you.

343
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,983
You're going to bring
my father back,

344
00:15:57,985 --> 00:16:01,754
then you and your troops
will return to the north.

345
00:16:01,756 --> 00:16:03,789
And why would I do that?

346
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:07,059
Because you still need me
to open the northern portal.

347
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:09,361
No, I don't.

348
00:16:09,363 --> 00:16:11,630
You've served your purpose.

349
00:16:11,632 --> 00:16:12,631
Aah!

350
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,281
Uh!

351
00:16:28,283 --> 00:16:29,649
If we get to Varrick's boat,

352
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:31,985
we can still save your father.
Let's go.

353
00:16:50,374 --> 00:16:52,207
You have a license
for that animal?

354
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:54,710
Uh, you fella's
seen a traveling circus

355
00:16:54,712 --> 00:16:55,811
come through here?

356
00:16:55,813 --> 00:16:57,380
Zhu li, do the thing.

357
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:02,718
That platypus-bear
is pooping money!

358
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,801
- Where's your dad?
- On a ship headed north.

359
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,369
Think we can catch up to it?

360
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:22,373
Sure, once you get us past
our friends from the north.

361
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,976
If only we had a plane
to get me close to those ships.

362
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:27,045
I could waterbend them
out of the way.

363
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,714
A plane? Well,
why didn't you say so?

364
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,258
Um, why do you have a plane
on your boat?

365
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,227
In case the boat sinks,
of course.

366
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:42,896
But there's no runway.

367
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:44,498
How are we supposed to take off?

368
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,600
Zhu li!
Take a note.

369
00:17:46,602 --> 00:17:49,836
Build runway.
Yes, sir.

370
00:17:49,838 --> 00:17:51,304
I have an idea.

371
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,283
Now!

372
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:46,025
Captain, you are never
gonna believe this.

373
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:54,767
There!
My dad's on that ship!

374
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,875
Jump!

375
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,927
Whooah!

376
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,699
Where are the prisoners?

377
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:32,905
Korra, this is crazy.

378
00:19:32,907 --> 00:19:35,240
You promised me
you wouldn't do anything rash.

379
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,375
I had to.
I'll explain later.

380
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,393
Sweetie! You're okay!

381
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,995
Oh! I was so worried!

382
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,898
Do you have something
you wanna say to your sister?

383
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,934
Ikki, I'm glad you're back.

384
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,871
Yeah, sorry we made fun of you.

385
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,707
Thanks.
Wanna play air ball?

386
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,743
- Sure!
- Yeah!

387
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,816
I wanted to apologize
for how I acted yesterday.

388
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:21,085
I've worked so hard
to celebrate dad's legacy

389
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,855
that I may have overlooked
the parts of him

390
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:25,889
that were less than ideal.

391
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,394
And we're sorry for dumping
our frustrations with dad

392
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:30,428
out on you.

393
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,797
Yeah, you didn't deserve that.

394
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,999
I thought you two
might wanna see this.

395
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:38,737
Mom gave it to me
before we left.

396
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:41,573
That is one
good-looking family, huh?

397
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:45,142
That's one happy family.

398
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:48,311
So once I knew the truth,

399
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,580
I couldn't sit by
and do nothing.

400
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,450
My own brother betrayed me.

401
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,652
And our entire tribe.

402
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,454
What's our next move?

403
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,623
I've been running from my past
for too long.

404
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,993
It's time to put my brother
in his place.

405
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,729
You have our support,
chief Tonraq.

406
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,997
Mine too.

407
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,932
I'll be proud
to fight alongside you, dad.

408
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,200
No, Korra.

409
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,701
But you said the South
doesn't stand a chance

410
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,169
against Unalaq's forces.

411
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,236
I can help.

412
00:21:14,238 --> 00:21:15,638
The best way for you to help

413
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,306
is by getting the president
of the united Republic

414
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:18,674
on our side.

415
00:21:18,676 --> 00:21:21,310
The South can give Unalaq
a good fight for a while.

416
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:25,847
But we'll need the united forces
in order to win this war.

417
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:30,652
All right, I'll get you
all the help you need.

418
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:32,153
I love you, dad.

419
00:21:32,155 --> 00:21:35,088
I love you too.

420
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,993
I really need to thank you,
Korra.

421
00:21:42,995 --> 00:21:45,796
For what?
I started a civil war.

422
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:47,163
Exactly!

423
00:21:47,165 --> 00:21:49,598
Now Eska and I
are officially broken up.

424
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,767
Oh, looks like we have company!

425
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,035
And not the fun kind!

426
00:21:56,305 --> 00:21:59,573
What is that?

427
00:22:05,313 --> 00:22:07,479
That would be my darling Eska.

428
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:09,180
Is this thing fast enough

429
00:22:09,182 --> 00:22:11,549
to get away from my crazy
waterbending ex-girlfriend?

430
00:22:11,551 --> 00:22:13,717
Why do you think
I built this boat?

431
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,244
