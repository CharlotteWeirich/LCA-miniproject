1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,180
Earth.

2
00:00:02,182 --> 00:00:03,982
Fire.

3
00:00:03,984 --> 00:00:05,516
Air.

4
00:00:05,518 --> 00:00:07,735
Water.

5
00:00:07,737 --> 00:00:12,023
Only the Avatar can master all four elements

6
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:14,042
and bring balance to the world.

7

8
00:00:19,883 --> 00:00:22,167
The air nation has its first recruit.

9
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:24,135
Team Avatar's search for new airbenders

10
00:00:24,137 --> 00:00:25,887
in the earth kingdom led them to Kai,

11
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:28,006
an orphan with a shady past.

12
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:30,008
Meanwhile, Lord Zuko is hot on the trail

13
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,843
of three escaped criminals
who pose a great threat

14
00:00:31,845 --> 00:00:32,845
to the Avatar.

15
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:34,679
Unaware of the danger to her,

16
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:37,515
Korra continues her mission
to find more airbenders.

17
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:40,101
Next stop, the walled city of Ba Sing Se.

18
00:00:51,114 --> 00:00:52,580
Light on your feet, Uncle Bumi.

19
00:00:52,582 --> 00:00:54,999
Remember, you want to be quick and evasive.

20
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:57,202
Don't worry about me, little lady.

21
00:00:57,204 --> 00:00:59,871
I've been in a scrap or two, you know.

22
00:00:59,873 --> 00:01:03,675
Oh, you're just a youngster,
so I'm going to go easy on you.

23
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:04,676
Wouldn't want to hurt a kid...

24
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:07,679
Oh!

25
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:10,915
Uncle Bumi,
you've got to work on your stance changes.

26
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:14,385
Kai, that was just... really good.

27
00:01:14,387 --> 00:01:16,721
Thanks, Jinora. You're a great teacher.

28
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:25,146
Hmm. Did I drop my wallet?

29
00:01:28,735 --> 00:01:30,451
Give me that, you little thief!

30
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:32,036
It's so exciting

31
00:01:32,038 --> 00:01:34,489
to be on a diplomatic mission to Ba Sing Se.

32
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:37,125
- What's the earth queen like?
- I've never met her,

33
00:01:37,127 --> 00:01:41,079
but I've heard she can be quite...
Demanding.

34
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:42,664
This is it, Mako! We made it!

35
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:45,383
This is where dad grew up!
Come here, look! Look!

36
00:01:45,385 --> 00:01:47,335
Okay, calm down. I'm looking.

37
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:56,177
I wonder how many airbenders are down there.

38
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,311
Ugh. The lower ring looks terrible.

39
00:02:13,313 --> 00:02:14,996
Yeah, I can smell it from here.

40
00:02:14,998 --> 00:02:16,414
No wonder dad left.

41
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:27,992
Hello, middle ring!

42
00:02:41,523 --> 00:02:45,109
Wow. Now, this is more like it.

43
00:02:55,237 --> 00:02:58,873
Avatar Korra, master Tenzin,
it is a pleasure to welcome you

44
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:02,126
and your party to the
upper ring of Ba Sing Se.

45
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:04,528
I'm grand secretariat gun.

46
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,914
Thank you.

47
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:10,585
Ahh, it's got that upper ring smell.

48
00:03:10,587 --> 00:03:12,036
Oh, no.

49
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:13,721
The queen hates animals.

50
00:03:13,723 --> 00:03:15,473
We've got to get them out of sight.

51
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:18,259
Well, I can just stash Pabu in my shirt.

52
00:03:18,261 --> 00:03:20,311
These two are gonna be a little tougher.

53
00:03:20,313 --> 00:03:23,214
Come with me, hurry.
I'll take you to your quarters.

54
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:26,684
Now, when you meet the queen,
make sure you bow low enough.

55
00:03:26,686 --> 00:03:28,152
That's very important.

56
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:31,022
And don't look her in the eye,
she can't stand that.

57
00:03:31,024 --> 00:03:33,891
If any food is served,
don't eat before she eats.

58
00:03:33,893 --> 00:03:35,860
Oh, actually,
I have to taste her food first,

59
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:40,231
then she eats, then you can eat.
Better yet, just don't eat.

60
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:42,417
Seems like an awful lot of rules.

61
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:44,786
Oh, you have no idea, and I'm the one

62
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:46,754
who gets in trouble when
people don't follow them,

63
00:03:46,756 --> 00:03:48,756
so please, please, for my sake,

64
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:51,959
just try not to upset her majesty.

65
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,103
Here we are. Ooh, very swanky.

66
00:04:02,105 --> 00:04:04,588
Now,
go in and make yourselves comfortable...

67
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,606
- Hey!
- And keep those animals

68
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:07,608
out of sight in the backyard.

69
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,427
Avatar Korra, if you'd follow me,

70
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:12,397
we don't want to keep her majesty waiting.

71
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:22,824
Your majesty, may I present Avatar Korra.

72
00:04:22,826 --> 00:04:26,077
You're ruining the koi pond!

73
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,880
It's completely overshadowed
by the topiaries!

74
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:30,915
Guards, take that buffoon away

75
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:34,919
and get me someone who
knows what they're doing!

76
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:38,806
You! Rip everything out and start over!

77
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:45,396
I am surrounded by idiots.

78
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:52,303
So I finally get a visit from the Avatar.

79
00:04:52,305 --> 00:04:55,606
Let me guess, you want something.

80
00:04:55,608 --> 00:04:58,242
Well, actually, your majesty,
I was hoping you could...

81
00:04:58,244 --> 00:05:01,496
I hardly think you're in a
position to ask me for favors

82
00:05:01,498 --> 00:05:04,615
after everything the last
Avatar did to the earth kingdom.

83
00:05:04,617 --> 00:05:06,784
He and fire Lord Zuko

84
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:09,153
took advantage of my father's weakness,

85
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:13,174
and stole our lands to make
their own little empire.

86
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:17,661
The united Republic is
earth kingdom territory.

87
00:05:17,663 --> 00:05:21,799
Well,
I-I'm not sure what I can do about that.

88
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:23,801
Not that you care,

89
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:27,555
but what's left of my
kingdom is falling to ruin.

90
00:05:27,557 --> 00:05:29,107
Roving bands of barbarians

91
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:31,225
are raiding villages in the countryside,

92
00:05:31,227 --> 00:05:37,031
and now, some of my subjects
are refusing to pay their taxes.

93
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:38,816
I'm very sorry for your troubles,

94
00:05:38,818 --> 00:05:41,736
but actually...
That topiary is supposed to be

95
00:05:41,738 --> 00:05:44,906
an eel-swan, not a turtle-duck!

96
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:51,195
Hey, has anyone seen Kai?

97
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:54,465
- Kai?
- Kai! Little bro?

98
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:56,167
He's not over here.

99
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:58,503
I don't think I've seen him since we landed.

100
00:05:58,505 --> 00:06:00,505
I knew that kid was no good.

101
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:02,373
He was just waiting for an opportunity

102
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,641
to run away again.

103
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:05,977
- We have to find him.
- What's the point?

104
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:08,513
He obviously doesn't care about us.

105
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:10,565
But he's my new little brother.

106
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:13,050
He's probably lost and scared.

107
00:06:13,052 --> 00:06:17,238
He is just a little boy,
and he's our responsibility.

108
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,740
Besides, he's the only airbender
we've recruited so far.

109
00:06:19,742 --> 00:06:21,058
We can't lose him.

110
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,728
Fine. Bolin and I will find him.

111
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,248
No! To your left!

112
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,733
Your other left!

113
00:06:29,735 --> 00:06:32,870
Do you have these problems
with your servants?

114
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:35,423
I don't really have servants.

115
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:37,842
But, your majesty, the reason for our visit

116
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:40,261
is that we're trying to gather
all of the new airbenders

117
00:06:40,263 --> 00:06:41,963
who are popping up in the earth kingdom,

118
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:44,632
and we'd like your help
finding the ones in Ba Sing Se.

119
00:06:44,634 --> 00:06:49,804
Airbenders in Ba Sing Se?
Where did you hear that?

120
00:06:49,806 --> 00:06:52,890
Before we left Republic City,
we got some reports.

121
00:06:52,892 --> 00:06:57,945
Hmm. Well,
before I even consider helping you,

122
00:06:57,947 --> 00:07:00,598
I'll need you to do something for me.

123
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,901
Oh. Of course. What is it?

124
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:05,987
I have a vault full of tax money

125
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:07,989
sitting in a town South of here.

126
00:07:07,991 --> 00:07:10,825
Barbarians have stolen
my past two shipments.

127
00:07:10,827 --> 00:07:16,380
Go collect my money and bring it back here.

128
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:18,132
Yes, your majesty.

129
00:07:30,262 --> 00:07:32,897
Kai! Did you go fishing?

130
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:34,815
You under the bridge?

131
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:44,942
Here, sir, let me help you.

132
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:49,280
Oh, thank you, young man.
What a strange sudden breeze.

133
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:51,832
Yeah, that was really weird.

134
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:53,701
Thanks for your help.

135
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:56,487
Kai!

136
00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:57,838
Get back here!

137
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,173
Kai, it's us!

138
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:00,541
Mako and Bolin!

139
00:08:00,543 --> 00:08:02,826
Your new family!

140
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:16,641
Excuse me, pardon me.

141
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:18,392
No, no, carry on.

142
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:25,700
What are you doing

143
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:27,851
running around robbing people?

144
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:29,904
I was just practicing my airbending.

145
00:08:29,906 --> 00:08:31,989
Yeah, right. Let's go.

146
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:33,857
You're in big trouble.

147
00:08:39,331 --> 00:08:41,248
Hey!

148
00:08:44,386 --> 00:08:46,087
Your little brother, huh?

149
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:48,889
Yeah, just a lovable little scamp, isn't he?

150
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:50,708
Reminds me of my little brother.

151
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,710
This is the express line to the lower ring.

152
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:55,229
Next stop, po Kong station.

153
00:09:10,395 --> 00:09:12,913
- Ah!
- Oh!

154
00:09:12,915 --> 00:09:15,399
All right,
let's see if we can catch a train back

155
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:17,401
to the upper ring.

156
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:22,239
Passports and tickets.

157
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:24,675
We can pay, hold on.

158
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:28,179
Where's my money?

159
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:32,466
No. Kai wouldn't...

160
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:34,918
aw, man!

161
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,920
All right, beat it, you two,

162
00:09:36,922 --> 00:09:39,857
before things get ugly. Ah, hey!

163
00:09:49,701 --> 00:09:53,037
The bad news is, we're stuck here.

164
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,272
The good news is, you can go the bathroom

165
00:09:55,274 --> 00:09:57,208
wherever you want.

166
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,334
Are you sure we shouldn't
have brought more people

167
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:09,886
to collect the tax money?

168
00:10:09,888 --> 00:10:11,671
There are royal guards waiting at the vault.

169
00:10:11,673 --> 00:10:13,556
I doubt anything will happen.

170
00:10:13,558 --> 00:10:16,342
I think her majesty just
likes ordering me around.

171
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,533
Man.

172
00:10:23,535 --> 00:10:26,002
Oh, I think I slipped a disc sleeping here.

173
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:30,039
It's been a while since we
spent the night on a trash pile.

174
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,941
It's about how I remembered.

175
00:10:31,943 --> 00:10:34,977
I bet everyone's freaking out
that we've been gone all night.

176
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:36,812
I'm worried about Kai.

177
00:10:36,814 --> 00:10:39,916
He's just a little kid out there on his own.

178
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:42,318
He's probably really scared.

179
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:51,010
Your breakfast, Master Fung.

180
00:10:51,012 --> 00:10:54,663
Keep the change.

181
00:10:54,665 --> 00:10:57,717
I love Ba Sing Se.

182
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:04,057
Whew, I'm getting hungry.

183
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:07,143
We might have to
hustle up a little breakfast

184
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:10,513
with the old fruit stand scam.

185
00:11:10,515 --> 00:11:13,232
Come on.

186
00:11:13,234 --> 00:11:15,151
You remember how it goes.

187
00:11:15,153 --> 00:11:19,122
I push you into the stand,
you scream, I pretend to faint.

188
00:11:19,124 --> 00:11:22,125
I don't want any part of this.
Besides, look at this fruit.

189
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:25,694
It's disgusting.
We don't want to steal this.

190
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:28,697
Hey, you trying to steal my fruit?

191
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:31,867
No, I just said I don't want
any of this rotten fruit.

192
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:34,420
Oh, you too good for my fruit?

193
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:36,389
This is the best fruit on the block.

194
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:39,542
So you want me to steal it?

195
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:44,097
Just try it, buddy.  Go ahead.

196
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:45,598
I'm confused.

197
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,683
Are we stealing the fruit or not?

198
00:11:47,685 --> 00:11:50,353
I knew it, thieves!

199
00:11:52,991 --> 00:11:55,057
What's going on here?

200
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:58,244
Dad,
these fruit thieves are insulting our fruit.

201
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:03,366
Bolin? Mako?

202
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:06,419
- How do you know our names?
- Yeah, I mean,

203
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:10,173
I'm famous, so I get that,
but how do you know his name?

204
00:12:10,175 --> 00:12:12,625
You look just like San.

205
00:12:12,627 --> 00:12:16,045
Tu, you'll never believe who these guys are.

206
00:12:16,047 --> 00:12:18,798
They're your cousins, my brother San's kids.

207
00:12:30,093 --> 00:12:33,312
Lord Zuko, Uncle.

208
00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:35,198
This is a surprise.

209
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,401
Finally something interesting happens.

210
00:12:38,403 --> 00:12:40,536
Ruling the tribe is so tedious.

211
00:12:40,538 --> 00:12:42,321
Then you should enjoy this.

212
00:12:42,323 --> 00:12:44,991
We need to check on a secret ice prison

213
00:12:44,993 --> 00:12:47,943
in the Western tundra.

214
00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:54,500
Your father sent us a letter
years ago with your names,

215
00:12:54,502 --> 00:12:56,636
but that was the last we heard from him.

216
00:12:56,638 --> 00:12:58,621
Then we saw your pictures
in the sports pages

217
00:12:58,623 --> 00:13:01,090
with your bending team, and Bolin,

218
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:03,009
we love those Nuktuk movers.

219
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:04,460
They're hilarious.

220
00:13:04,462 --> 00:13:07,463
Yeah, they're not really comedies,
but, uh...

221
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:10,299
yeah, I could probably be a pro-bender,

222
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:11,901
or an actor, or something

223
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:15,321
if I lived in a mansion in
Republic City like you guys.

224
00:13:15,323 --> 00:13:17,607
You don't know what it's
like here on the streets.

225
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:19,308
You gotta be tough.

226
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,644
Oh, Mako and I grew up on the streets.

227
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:24,497
We were homeless,
then we were kind of in a gang,

228
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:28,284
then we lived in a gym.

229
00:13:28,286 --> 00:13:30,253
Hey, everybody! Look who's here!

230
00:13:30,255 --> 00:13:32,788
San's kids, Mako and Bolin!

231
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,290
- No way.
- Come in.

232
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:36,492
Welcome.

233
00:13:36,494 --> 00:13:41,097
Is it true? After all these years?

234
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:44,300
Boys, this is your grandmother, Yin.

235
00:13:44,302 --> 00:13:47,937
Oh, it is so wonderful to finally meet

236
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:50,857
my long-lost grandchildren.

237
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,013
Where is San and your mother?

238
00:13:58,015 --> 00:14:02,902
Wait, you mean, you don't know?

239
00:14:02,904 --> 00:14:05,238
I'm sorry.

240
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,022
They were killed when we were little.

241
00:14:26,476 --> 00:14:28,711
I don't like the looks of this.

242
00:14:28,713 --> 00:14:30,646
Let's hurry up and get out of here.

243
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:35,551
You here to pick up the tax shipment?

244
00:14:35,553 --> 00:14:37,236
Go ahead and load it on the airship.

245
00:15:07,084 --> 00:15:08,884
So much for our escorts.

246
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:11,420
Maybe we should've brought everybody else.

247
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:26,243
Step away from the gold,
ladies, and you won't get hurt.

248
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:28,579
Sorry to disappoint you,
but we're taking this gold

249
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:30,014
back to Ba Sing Se.

250
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:32,716
Aw, we love gals with spirit.

251
00:15:32,718 --> 00:15:35,352
Suit yourself.

252
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,709
Aah!

253
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:09,003
Oh!

254
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:15,926
Retreat! Retreat!

255
00:16:15,928 --> 00:16:18,679
You're on the wrong side of this fight,
Avatar!

256
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:21,632
That gold belongs to the people,
not the queen!

257
00:16:21,634 --> 00:16:24,818
Why do I get the feeling he's right?

258
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:33,810
Why didn't anyone tell us
we have a secret prison

259
00:16:33,812 --> 00:16:35,913
we could have been throwing people in?

260
00:16:35,915 --> 00:16:38,499
I'd like to put my tailor in here.

261
00:16:38,501 --> 00:16:40,534
He never gets my cuffs right.

262
00:16:40,536 --> 00:16:42,319
They're so creasy.

263
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:52,680
We built this place
secretly with your father

264
00:16:52,682 --> 00:16:55,716
to hold a very special prisoner.

265
00:16:55,718 --> 00:16:58,602
She's a powerful firebender named P'Li

266
00:16:58,604 --> 00:17:01,522
who can create explosions with her mind.

267
00:17:01,524 --> 00:17:05,008
Ironically,
I hired a guy with a similar ability

268
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,945
to kill the Avatar myself once.

269
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:12,849
Didn't work.

270
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:14,618
Don't feel bad.

271
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,905
I tried to kill Korra after
she ruined my wedding.

272
00:17:17,907 --> 00:17:19,206
It happens.

273
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:22,576
Let's just focus on keeping
this woman in prison.

274
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,673
The intense cold prevents
her from firebending.

275
00:17:35,675 --> 00:17:39,176
There's certainly no way
anyone's breaking out of here.

276
00:17:39,178 --> 00:17:42,763
That's what we thought about
the other three prisons.

277
00:17:44,183 --> 00:17:46,883
Must be something exciting going on.

278
00:17:46,885 --> 00:17:50,521
No one interesting has
visited me in 13 years.

279
00:17:50,523 --> 00:17:52,106
Don't get used to it.

280
00:17:52,108 --> 00:17:55,559
He's out, isn't he?

281
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:59,496
Mmm, I'm feeling warmer already.

282
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:06,903
This is so great.
We've never had a family before.

283
00:18:06,905 --> 00:18:11,575
Now we've got... 1, 2, 5, 11...

284
00:18:11,577 --> 00:18:14,294
A big family! Yeah!

285
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:16,747
So why did dad leave Ba Sing Se?

286
00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:19,133
Oh, he always had big dreams.

287
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:21,435
He couldn't wait to get
out and see the world.

288
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:23,587
Your grandfather thought it was ridiculous.

289
00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:26,757
He wanted San to stay home
and work the fruit stand,

290
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:31,061
but San was determined to leave,
and they had a huge fight.

291
00:18:31,063 --> 00:18:33,397
And that was the last time they ever spoke.

292
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:38,268
Oh, um, sorry, mom.

293
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,038
Come with me.

294
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,625
I have something to show you.

295
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:51,782
This is the only letter
we ever got from San.

296
00:18:51,784 --> 00:18:54,218
It says he married a beautiful girl

297
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,006
from the fire nation and
had two wonderful sons.

298
00:18:59,008 --> 00:19:02,959
He sent this picture of
you all on his birthday.

299
00:19:02,961 --> 00:19:06,096
Look, Mako. Dad's wearing your scarf.

300
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:09,466
I'm so sad that I never
got to meet your mother,

301
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:12,019
but you have her eyes.

302
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:15,138
I know from looking at you
two that she must have been

303
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,775
a wonderful bride for my boy.

304
00:19:24,082 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm sure they would want you to have this.

305
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:43,300
Your majesty, the Avatar has
returned with the tax payments.

306
00:19:43,302 --> 00:19:45,936
Finally. Secure it in the vault.

307
00:19:45,938 --> 00:19:47,888
It's being done as we speak.

308
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,557
So now, your majesty,
if I could start meeting

309
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,676
some of the airbenders here in the city.

310
00:19:52,678 --> 00:19:55,178
The Dai Li thoroughly searched the city,

311
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,197
but it seems your reports were incorrect.

312
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:59,900
There are no airbenders in Ba Sing Se.

313
00:19:59,902 --> 00:20:02,319
So you can gather your little band

314
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:03,904
and be on your way tomorrow.

315
00:20:03,906 --> 00:20:07,791
You make me do your dirty work
extorting your own citizens

316
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:10,210
for your stupid palaces and topiaries,

317
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:12,195
and then you just want to send me away?

318
00:20:12,197 --> 00:20:15,332
We're not going anywhere
until we find some airbenders!

319
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:17,751
We know there are some here!

320
00:20:17,753 --> 00:20:20,704
Get her out of my sight!

321
00:20:21,873 --> 00:20:23,390
This isn't over!

322
00:20:23,392 --> 00:20:26,343
I'm going to find the airbenders!

323
00:20:28,563 --> 00:20:31,732
You know,
San would have been so proud of you guys.

324
00:20:31,734 --> 00:20:33,717
Traveling the world with the Avatar,

325
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:35,235
he would have loved that.

326
00:20:35,237 --> 00:20:38,021
We actually need to get back to
the Avatar in the upper ring.

327
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:40,056
We're supposed to be
helping her find airbenders

328
00:20:40,058 --> 00:20:41,725
in Ba Sing Se.

329
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:45,779
What? What happened?

330
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:48,949
One of our neighbors started
airbending about a week ago.

331
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:51,702
A couple days later, two Dai Li agents

332
00:20:51,704 --> 00:20:53,754
come out of nowhere and snatch him up.

333
00:20:53,756 --> 00:20:56,340
No one's seen him since.

334
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:59,092
They say the earth queen's
locking all the airbenders up

335
00:20:59,094 --> 00:21:02,379
somewhere and using them for experiments.

336
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:07,217
Tu! Don't talk like that about her majesty.

337
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:09,586
Long may she reign.

338
00:21:09,588 --> 00:21:12,773
We have to get back to the
upper ring and tell Korra.

339
00:21:12,775 --> 00:21:15,809
I hope Kai is okay.

340
00:21:18,898 --> 00:21:21,698
Here sir, let me help you.

341
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:39,082
Hey! What's going on?

342
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:42,302
I didn't do anything! I'm with the Avatar!

343
00:21:48,093 --> 00:21:53,129
Welcome to her majesty's army,
first airbending regiment.

344
00:21:53,131 --> 00:21:58,068
From now on,
you live to fight for the earth queen.

345
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,460
