1
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,820
Earth.

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,360
Fire.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,910
Air.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,370
Water.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,890
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,420
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,340
Republic City is at war.

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,020
After discovering that her father,
Hiroshi Sato, is working with the enemy,

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,970
Asami turns against him.

10
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,500
And following another defeat
at the hands of the Equalists,

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,430
Lin Beifong resigns
as Chief of Police.

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,560
With the Equalist
army growing stronger...

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,630
Who will help the Avatar stop Amon
and restore balance to the city?

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,020
You're finally here.

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,490
Welcome to Air Temple Island.

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,020
Your new home.

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,250
Yes, welcome to my domain.

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,200
Well, aren't you sweet, little monk child?

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,540
What's that fuzzy creature?

22
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,290
That is a fire ferret,

23
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,620
an arboreal mammal common to the bamboo forest

24
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,630
south of the Central Earth Kingdom.

25
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,070
Aw, he's cute!

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,730
Hip hip, fly sky bison, fly!

27
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,110
Thanks for sending the Air
acolytes to help us with the move.

28
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,550
Yes, they've been amazing.

29
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,690
Such tireless workers.

30
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,630
Thought you were only bringing a few things.

31
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,960
Trust me, it could have been worse.

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,050
No problem.

33
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,990
Everyone here wants you guys to feel welcome.

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,510
You're pretty, can I
have some of your hair?

35
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,360
Looks like I have some competition.

36
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,140
And now for the grand tour!

37
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,650
The flying bisons live in those caves down there,

38
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,300
and that's the temple grandpa Aang built

39
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,610
and that's the greenhouse where
we grow the vegetables we eat.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,360
I have a couple of questions.

41
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,630
Is this an all-vegetarian island?

44
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,680
And final question:
How many trees are on this island?

45
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,980
Yes; yes; no; no; 10,552.

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,360
So, where are we gonna be staying?

47
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,960
You're a boy, boys have
to stay on the boys' side.

48
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,400
I'll be happy to show you
to the men's dormitory.

49
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,250
I'm a boy.

50
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,480
Meelo, why don't you go with the boys too?

51
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,400
We shall meet again soon,
beautiful woman.

52
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,220
Ikki and I will take you
to your room. This way.

53
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,910
Asami, did you know Korra likes Mako?

54
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,850
Oh, uh, no, I wasn't
completely aware of that.

55
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,020
Hey!

56
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,150
Run along, Ikki.

57
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,660
So... here's your room.

58
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,890
I know this is a little rustic
compared to what you're used to.

59
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,600
I think it's really charming.
And the best part about it?

60
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,910
Nothing here reminds me of my father.

61
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,340
Thank you for your hospitality.

62
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,810
Ikki, I swear, if you don't leave us alone,
I'm gonna...

63
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,600
Tenzin! Come right in.

64
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,750
Good day, ladies.
Asami, welcome to the island.

65
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,930
Thank you for having me.

66
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,760
Beifong's replacement's Saikhan is going to
be inducted as the new Chief of Police later.

67
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,680
I think we should both be there.

68
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,760
It was an honor serving under
Chief Beifong for so many years.

69
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,220
And I wish her a
speedy recovery.

70
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,690
It is with great humility that I take
her place as the new Chief of Police.

71
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,480
Republic City is facing a threat like
none the world has ever seen.

72
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,440
But there's one man who has been effective
against Amon's revolution, Councilman Tarrlok.

73
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:24,540
That is why for all the matters involving the
Equalists, I will report directly to him.

74
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:31,150
The Police Department will hand any and all available
resources to the councilman and his task force.

75
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,370
Until we quell this insurgency.

76
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,390
What is that weasel-snake Tarrlok up to now?

77
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,400
Tarrlok, I don't know what you did to
get Chief Saikhan in your pocket,

78
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,410
but I highly doubt it was legal.

79
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,580
Oh, Tenzin, always the conspiracy theorist.

80
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,800
Did you ever consider Saikhan

81
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,670
simply recognizes my talents
and wants what is best for the city?

82
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,900
Well, Avatar Korra.
Long time no see.

83
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,540
Now that your little pro-bending
distractions are over,

84
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,350
I look forward to your return to my task force.

85
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,330
Forget it, there's no way I'm
rejoining your vanity project.

86
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,450
That is unfortunate to hear,

87
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,900
but I'm sure you'll come to
your senses as you have in the past.

88
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,880
Don't hold your breath, bub.

89
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,590
You know, Tenzin's been right about you all along.

90
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,010
You played me, you played Beifong...

91
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,500
and now you're playing the new Chief too.

92
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,500
Well, I got news for you:

93
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,990
You need me, but I don't need you.

94
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,400
I'm the Avatar.

95
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,470
You are not, in fact ,the Avatar,

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,470
you are merely a half-baked Avatar in training.

97
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,400
Which reminds me...

98
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,820
How is your airbending going?

99
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,090
Made any significant progress with that?

100
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,390
I didn't think so.

101
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,470
If you will not be part of my task force,

102
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,930
then you'd best stay out of my way.

103
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,810
I don't understand
what's wrong with me.

104
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,420
I've memorized nearly all
of the practice forms,

105
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,880
but I still can't produce
a single, measly puff of air!

106
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,400
I'm a failure.

107
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,300
No, you're not.

108
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,320
You just need to work through this airbending block.

109
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,010
Amazing advice. I'll get right on that.

110
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,950
I wasn't finished yet.

111
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,070
You see, Aang not only had
his bending teachers,

112
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,090
but also his past lives
to call upon for guidance.

113
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,710
Have you ever made contact
with your past lives?

114
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,170
No, of course I haven't.

115
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,900
Didn't you get the memo
from the White Lotus?

116
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,030
I'm a spiritual failure, too.

117
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,110
You may have made a connection
without realizing it.

118
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,720
Perhaps something you mistook as a dream?

119
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,430
Maybe...

120
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,910
I had a few weird hallucinations,
but I hardly even remember them.

121
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,470
Did you see any of the previous
Avatars in these visions?

122
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,300
I saw Aang.

123
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,330
It seemed like he was in trouble.

124
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,800
What do you think it means?

125
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:02,920
I don't know. But I urge you
to meditate on these visions.

126
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,770
I believe Aang's spirit must be
trying to tell you something.

127
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,510
Korra. Are you out here?

128
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,640
Korra!

129
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,680
There you are.

130
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,540
Are you okay?

131
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,650
I'm fine.

132
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,200
Come on, what's wrong?
You can tell us.

133
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,360
How am I supposed to save this city,
when I can't even learn airbending?

134
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,160
I'm the worst Avatar ever!

135
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,640
I just feel... alone.

136
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,990
No, that's non-sense, you're amazing.

137
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,010
Yeah and remember,

138
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:58,000
Aang hadn't mastered all the elements
while he was battling the Fire Nation.

139
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,420
He was just a little kid.

140
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,350
And he wasn't alone, he had
his friends to help him.

141
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,600
Look, the arena might be shut down,

142
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,980
but we're still a team, the New Team Avatar!

143
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,320
We got your back Korra and we
can save the city together.

144
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,090
Yeah, let's do it.

145
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,530
Yeah, let's do it!

146
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,790
What are we doing?

147
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,260
Get ready, Republic City.

148
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,060
You are about to be patrolled by Team Avatar.

149
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:36,330
Asami, you always know how to accessorize your outfits.

150
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:41,620
I figured one way to fight Equalists is to use an Equalist weapon.

151
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,520
Alright, let's ride.

152
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,150
Naga away!

153
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,880
Alright, scratch that. Any other ideas?

154
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,610
I think I have the answer.

155
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,920
You think this will do?

156
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,740
I like the New Team Avatar's style.

157
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,800
Unit 2-16, cancel that 10-58 in Harmony Tower.

158
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,420
Come back to the station. Over.

159
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,130
My dad had police scanners
installed in all of his cars,

160
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,130
I guess now I know why.

161
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,690
Calling all units. Level Four Alert.
Jailbreak at Headquarters.

162
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,700
Officers down. Electrocuted.

163
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,730
Chi-blockers and Equalist convicts are still
at large armed and dangerous.

164
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,590
Last seen heading east. I repeat
Level Four Alert. Equalist Jailbreak.

165
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,590
Chi-blockers! That's them!

166
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,130
Let's get them!

167
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,130
Korra, Bolin, give me a ramp! Now!

168
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,580
Help me out! We've got to make this turn!

169
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,040
They don't know we made the turn.

170
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,420
Ok. Get ready...

171
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,990
Avatar Korra, what do
you think you're doing?

172
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:52,260
Oh, hey, Tarrlok, nice for you to show up finally.

173
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,550
Here, we captured these escaped convicts for you.

174
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What you did was tear up the city,

175
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,780
and impede the real authorities
in their pursuit of these criminals.

176
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,000
That's funny.

177
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,240
I didn't see your little task force or the cops the whole time.

178
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,880
If it wasn't for Team Avatar,
they would have gotten away.

179
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,000
This is your last warning:
Stay out of my way!

180
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,460
Republic city stands as
a beacon of freedom,

181
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,410
but the Equalists are using
that freedom to tear it down.

182
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,220
The law I have proposed would make it illegal

183
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,770
for anyone to be a member of the Equalists

184
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,250
or even be associated with them.

185
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,900
It also puts into effect a curfew

186
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,000
insuring all non-benders are
in their own homes by nightfall.

187
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,450
This is going too far, Tarrlok.

188
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,000
You can't punish all non-benders for the actions of a few.

189
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:49,880
That kind of cowardice will cause
our city to fall into Amon's hands.

190
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,580
We must pass this law.

191
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,320
All in favor?

192
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,570
All available units. Please respond to the
50-600 block at Dragon Flats Borough.

193
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,870
Equalists have been taken to the streets.

194
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,050
Consider them armed
and dangerous. Proceed with caution.

195
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,210
I call front.

196
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,300
After you.
What a gentleman, thanks.

197
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,150
Why is the power out?

198
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,850
Wait a second, these people
aren't armed or dangerous.

199
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,900
It sure doesn't look that way.

200
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:07,100
All non-benders, return to
your homes immediately.

201
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,050
Yeah, as soon as you
turn our power back on.

202
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,630
Disperse or you will all be arrested.

203
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,590
You benders can't treat us this way!

204
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,000
Mommy, look! It's the Avatar.

205
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,450
Please, help us!
You're our Avatar too.

206
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:32,720
Everyone please stay calm,
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

207
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,440
Tarrlok!

208
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,330
You need to turn the power back on
and leave these people alone.

209
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,780
Avatar Korra, you and your
playmates have no business here.

210
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,300
We're not going anywhere.

211
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,760
You don't have the right to treat
these innocent people like criminals.

212
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,070
This is an Equalist rally,
there's nothing innocent about it.

213
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,770
They're not Equalists,

214
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,750
they're just normal people
who want their rights back.

215
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,000
They are the enemy!

216
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,010
Round up all these Equalists!

217
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,990
Stop!

218
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,460
Hey! Let me go!

219
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,800
You're under arrest.

220
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,880
What? You can't do that.

221
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,450
Actually, I can.

222
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,590
She's a non-bender out past curfew

223
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,590
and her father is a known Equalist conspirator.

224
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,870
Let her go.

225
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,100
Arrest him and his brother.

226
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,590
Tarrlok!

227
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,400
Unless you want to join your friends in prison,

228
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,900
I suggest you put those down
and go back to the Air Temple.

229
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,960
Korra, listen to him.
It's not worth it.

230
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,360
We'll be alright.

231
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,760
Don't worry, I'll call Tenzin.
He can get you out.

232
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:35,330
It's so sad to see your little Team Avatar broken up.

233
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,670
You had a good run.

234
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,750
This isn't over, Tarrlok.

235
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:42,580
Oh, I believe it is.
Take them away!

236
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,150
Hey!

237
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,070
I came as fast as I could.

238
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,790
Are your friends alright?

239
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,580
I don't know, these knuckleheads
won't tell me anything.

240
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,690
I'll take care of this.

241
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,680
Saikhan, a word please?

242
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,300
Councilman Tenzin. I'm pretty swamped at the moment.

243
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,060
Can this wait?

244
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,080
No it cannot.

245
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,480
Three of Avatar Korra's friends
were wrongly arrested tonight.

246
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,520
I'd like you to release
them immediately.

247
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,890
They're not going anywhere.

248
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,930
They were interfering with police business.

249
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,900
Your so-called police business was
rounding up innocent people

250
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,940
and claiming they were Equalists.

251
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,140
They should be released too.

252
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,800
All Equalist suspects are
being detained indefinitely.

253
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,840
They'll be freed, if and when the task force
deems they are no longer a threat.

254
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,720
Those people are entitled to
due process under the law.

255
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,270
You'll have to take that with
councilman Tarrlok.

256
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,370
Oh, I plan to.

257
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,720
At the council meeting, first thing in the morning.

258
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,970
You're officially the worst
Chief of Police ever!

259
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,190
Calm down, Korra.

260
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,600
I'll get this sorted out,
we just need to be patient.

261
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,520
But you really are the worst.

262
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,380
Ever.

263
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,590
Wake up, Naga.
Let's go.

264
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,980
Wait for me here, girl.
Don't worry, I'll be alright.

265
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,040
You and I need to talk.

266
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,030
Are any of the other
council members here?

267
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,230
I believe everyone has
gone home for the night.

268
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,460
Then you should do the same.

269
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,490
Are you sure, sir?

270
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,760
Leave us.

271
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,130
You obviously have
something on your mind.

272
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,420
Spit it out.

273
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,480
Don't you see?

274
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,950
You're doing exactly what Amon
says is wrong with benders.

275
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,800
You're using your power to
oppress and intimidate people.

276
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,230
And you don't?

277
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,580
Of... of course not!

278
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,720
Isn't that what you came here to do?

279
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,520
Intimidate me into releasing your friends?

280
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,120
See? That's what I admire
about you, Korra.

281
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,750
Your willingness to go to extremes
in order to get what you want.

282
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,550
It is a quality we both share.

283
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,850
You and I are nothing alike.

284
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,790
Look, I'll make you a deal.

285
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,300
You fall in line and do what I say,

286
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,320
and I'll release your friends.

287
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:10,280
That's why you arrested them?
To get to me?

288
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,190
I need your answer.

289
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,600
No.

290
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,800
You might be able to manipulate
Chief Saikhan into following you,

291
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,310
but it won't work on me.

292
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,970
You will regret that decision.

293
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,140
You need to be stopped.
You're just as bad as Amon.

294
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,810
I've tried to work with you, Korra,

295
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,260
but you've made it impossible.

296
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,790
Still think I'm a half-baked Avatar?

297
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,360
What are you gonna do now?

298
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,500
You're all out of water, pal.

299
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,170
You're in my way, Avatar.

300
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,410
And you need to be removed.

301
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,860
You're...you're a...

302
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,570
bloodbender?

303
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,200
Very observant.

304
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,360
It's... not a full moon.

305
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,290
How...how are you doing this?

306
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,220
There are a lot of things
you don't know about me.

307
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,410
Where are you taking me?

308
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,920
Somewhere no one will find you.

309
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,200
Say goodbye to Republic City, Avatar Korra.

310
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,230
You'll never see it again.

311
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,020
You can't do this!
Let me out!

312
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,140
