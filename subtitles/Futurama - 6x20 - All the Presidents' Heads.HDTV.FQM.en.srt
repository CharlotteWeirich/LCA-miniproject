2
00:00:31,726 --> 00:00:33,429
Good news, everyone.

3
00:00:33,554 --> 00:00:36,495
Remember when you asked
to see my family tree?

4
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:37,496
No.

5
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,955
Ta-da!

6
00:00:40,456 --> 00:00:41,868
This is my ancestor

7
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:45,178
Philo Farnsworth,
inventor of television,

8
00:00:45,303 --> 00:00:48,274
and as a bonus, childhood obesity.

9
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,911
And here's Dean Farnsworth,

10
00:00:51,036 --> 00:00:54,513
developer of the Farnsworth test
for colorblindness.

11
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,473
Where is he, blasted?!

12
00:00:56,639 --> 00:01:00,172
And just recently, I learned
of a modern-day Farnsworth

13
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:02,611
who invented the anti-senility truss.

14
00:01:02,736 --> 00:01:04,190
That's you, Professor.

15
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,036
Ah, yes, the Farnsworths boast

16
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:11,430
a proud and distinguished lineage.

17
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:13,573
No wormy fruit on this tree.

18
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:14,802
What about fry?

19
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:16,284
Isn't he your distant Uncle?

20
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,424
Very distant.

21
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,371
Not a true Farnsworth, mind you.

22
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:22,514
He's way over here
on this filthy branch

23
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:25,013
riddled with fungus and dung beetles.

24
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,749
What's with the 17 dung beetles?

25
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:31,550
Well, it's 6:00.

26
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,986
I guess we'll have to deliver
that human heart tomorrow.

27
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:35,378
Good work, people.

28
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,556
Time to go clubbing!

29
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,058
Baby seals, here I come.

30
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:43,186
Guess I better
head over to my night job.

31
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:44,438
You have a night job?

32
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,965
Yup. It's exhausting,

33
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,800
but I need the extra money
to buy coffee

34
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:49,484
so I can stay awake for my night job.

35
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,167
- But...
- Got to go!

36
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:57,777
You've got a surprising
amount of algae

37
00:01:57,902 --> 00:01:59,412
in your beard, Mr. President.

38
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:01,647
Just sit still and let the
algae-eater do its work.

39
00:02:01,772 --> 00:02:03,123
Oh! Ow!

40
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,709
Oh! Lay off my trademark mole!

41
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,386
Hi, Lars.

42
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:08,988
Fry.
Whatever.

43
00:02:09,113 --> 00:02:10,790
I'm heading out to my night job.

44
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:13,049
Remember, no loud noise,
no head bowling,

45
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:16,511
and no parties,
or it'll be your ass in a jar.

46
00:02:16,677 --> 00:02:17,854
I want to go to that museum!

47
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:26,073
Man, this place is a snooze.

48
00:02:26,198 --> 00:02:26,855
Hey, fry,

49
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:30,509
I challenge president taft here
to a pie-eating contest.

50
00:02:30,634 --> 00:02:31,943
You're on, skinny.

51
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:33,512
Sorry, guys.
You know the rules.

52
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:35,047
No fun allowed.

53
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:36,907
Come on, you pansy!
I'm thirsty!

54
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,053
I want me some Tennessee loopy juice!

55
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:40,286
And I want loose women!

56
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:42,120
The kind that aren't afraid
to show a little ankle.

57
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,664
Or elbow.

58
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,000
No visitors.
I'll lose my job.

59
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,760
Oh, boo-hoo,
I'll lose my minimum wage job.

60
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,885
You're mean, rutherford b. Hayes!

61
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,269
Listen here, young man.

62
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:58,971
We have nothing to fear

63
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,867
but running out of beer.

64
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,208
Oh!

65
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,310
All right, one small get-together,

66
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,520
but let's keep it
quiet and dignified.

67
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,881
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

68
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:10,483
Ooh-wee!

69
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,822
Four more beers!

70
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,741
Four more beers!

71
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:21,560
Yes!

72
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,229
Right in the ike!

73
00:03:23,354 --> 00:03:25,622
Nice elbow action.

74
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,634
So, you grow hemp.

75
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,436
Yes. And, uh, you do what with it?

76
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:32,738
All manner of things.

77
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:35,632
Manufacture paper, fabric, rope...

78
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,010
Oh. Well, nice talking to you.

79
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:41,380
Why, I used to smoke
about four feet of rope a day.

80
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:43,306
Let me give you my pager number.

81
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:47,491
Hey, Reagan, remember when
you asked to see my family tree?

82
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:49,687
I asked you to leave me alone.

83
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:53,316
The Farnsworths are a remarkable...

84
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:57,087
Farnsworth?! That name is a
stain on American history.

85
00:03:57,212 --> 00:04:00,532
One of the worst traitors of
the revolution was a Farnsworth.

86
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,034
- You're lying!
- He's George Washington.

87
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,303
He tends not to do that.

88
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:08,808
David Farnsworth was a notorious
British agent and counterfeiter.

89
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:11,251
He conspired to bring down our nation

90
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,086
with his fraudulent currency!

91
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:15,227
A Farnsworth did this?

92
00:04:15,352 --> 00:04:18,651
Oh, dear!
My good name is ruined!

93
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:20,306
Hi. I'm Jerry.

94
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:21,595
I like movies.

95
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,763
♪ ♪

96
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:28,527
Anyone seen ulysses grant?

97
00:04:28,652 --> 00:04:30,062
He owes me a cheroot.

98
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,921
He's over there,
puking in the bushes.

99
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,692
No!

100
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:41,240
Oh, boy.

101
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,675
Mr. Fry!

102
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,443
Why are all these people
standing around...

103
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:47,036
When they should be partying?

104
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,623
Hey, hey, lbj, you want to get drunk?

105
00:04:53,748 --> 00:04:54,979
Oh, hell, yeah.

106
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,172
Zoidberg, no!

107
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,825
The effects of jar juice

108
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,383
aren't fully understood.

109
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:04,135
Eh, not bad.
A hint of vitalis and...

110
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,222
Whoa!

111
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:09,974
I recognize this.

112
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:11,533
It's the 1960s!

113
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:14,294
I did a report on it for
my drug-taking class.

114
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:15,982
Hi, I'm Andy warhol,

115
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:20,060
and you're some kind
of marvelous lobster-man.

116
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:21,052
Right on.

117
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:24,119
Say, you got any real soup,
or just this schlock?

118
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,160
What a horrid bore.

119
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,162
Ooh.
Huh?

120
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:30,556
Far out.

121
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:32,874
That head gave me a total head trip!

122
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,460
Really? I'm gonna lick
Herbert Hoover's head.

123
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,212
Lick the head!

124
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,546
Lick the head!

125
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:46,805
Whoa, a speakeasy!

126
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,848
One prohibited beverage, please.

127
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:50,433
Hey, Dutch, the new still is here!

128
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:53,114
I'm not a still. I
just smell like one.

129
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,728
Dutch Schultz,
come out with your bootleg whiskey.

130
00:05:57,853 --> 00:05:58,358
We're thirsty!

131
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:06,616
What the heck is going on?

132
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:08,994
Jefferson,
did you sell me some bad rope?

133
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,607
It must have something to do
with the jar fluid.

134
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:14,602
Aha!

135
00:06:14,727 --> 00:06:18,557
Dr. Cahill, do I detect
a trace of opalescence?

136
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:20,135
Very observant, Professor.

137
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,395
To preserve the heads,
we use a rare form

138
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,967
of powdered crystalline opal.

139
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:27,554
This is the world's entire supply.

140
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,549
Yet it's so powerful,
it should last a thousand years.

141
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:33,519
It keeps the heads alive,
but we don't know how.

142
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,059
Why did it give us
those hallucinations?

143
00:06:36,184 --> 00:06:37,423
Because it didn't!

144
00:06:37,548 --> 00:06:39,232
Uh, yeah-huh.

145
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,371
Opal has unusual temporal properties.

146
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:45,331
It preserves each head
in a time stasis bubble.

147
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:49,642
Ergo, licking those heads
actually sent us back in time

148
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:52,006
to their original eras. Look!

149
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:53,079
Ugh!

150
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:54,497
Schlock and more schlock.

151
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,597
Psst. Is the coast clear?

152
00:06:57,722 --> 00:06:59,711
Button your yap, you mug.

153
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:03,105
I've discovered a new means
of time travel.

154
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,599
I'll call it the Farnsworth effect!

155
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:07,385
Nice try,

156
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:10,549
but even this discovery won't
undo the treachery wrought

157
00:07:10,674 --> 00:07:13,975
by your nefarious ancestor
David Farnsworth.

158
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:17,401
It will if we go back
in time and stop him!

159
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,608
Oh!

160
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:26,845
Professor, no! You can't tongue
the father of our country!

161
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:32,074
Where are we?

162
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,791
Also, when are we?

163
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,582
68th and Broadway, colonial era.

164
00:07:39,882 --> 00:07:41,377
Rush hour.

165
00:07:43,606 --> 00:07:45,193
By my calculations,

166
00:07:45,318 --> 00:07:47,862
this head trip will last
at most 24 hours.

167
00:07:47,987 --> 00:07:51,596
We need to stop that monster
David Farnsworth!

168
00:07:52,058 --> 00:07:53,389
Look at
the date on this newspaper.

169
00:07:53,555 --> 00:07:56,237
April 17, 1775.

170
00:07:56,362 --> 00:07:59,073
Say, on this exact date,

171
00:07:59,198 --> 00:08:02,811
the continental congress was
meeting secretly in New York.

172
00:08:02,936 --> 00:08:04,279
Maybe they can help us.

173
00:08:04,404 --> 00:08:05,819
But they could be meeting anywhere.

174
00:08:06,072 --> 00:08:08,530
What are we going to do,
search building to building?

175
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,950
We'll start with that one.

176
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:15,328
Alexander Hamilton of New York,
how say you?

177
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:16,329
Nay!

178
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:17,725
John hancock

179
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,207
and John Adams of Massachusetts?

180
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,625
Yea!
Yea!

181
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:22,363
The yeas have it.

182
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:25,266
Our nation's official joke state
shall be new Jersey.

183
00:08:26,993 --> 00:08:28,203
Uh-oh.

184
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,140
Ah, 'tis just our new crock pot.

185
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,578
Watch it, wiggy.

186
00:08:36,703 --> 00:08:38,112
I ain't no stinking crock.

187
00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:40,395
We'll see about that in five hours.

188
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:44,691
Halt! From whence comest
thou, one-eyed maiden?

189
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,152
Uh... ever been to Peru?

190
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,356
Certainly not.

191
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:49,571
I'm from Peru.

192
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,392
Clam up, founding fathers.

193
00:08:51,517 --> 00:08:54,576
We need help
locating the treacherous forger

194
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,994
who forged this forgery.

195
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:58,933
My word.

196
00:08:59,058 --> 00:09:00,468
If these enter circulation,

197
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:01,903
our economy will be destroyed,

198
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:04,172
and with it, our
chance at independence.

199
00:09:04,297 --> 00:09:05,907
Only one man in the colonies

200
00:09:06,032 --> 00:09:08,276
has a printing press
fine enough to make these.

201
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:10,717
Our good friend Ben Franklin!

202
00:09:10,937 --> 00:09:13,219
Uh-oh. Isn't Franklin
in Philadelphia?

203
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:16,684
When he's not in Charlotte
or Marybelle or Louisa.

204
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,561
I don't get it.

205
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,491
I'm sure
no one's ever said this before,

206
00:09:23,616 --> 00:09:27,819
but I must get to Philadelphia
as quickly as possible!

207
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,936
Oh! Why couldn't my
disgraced ancestor

208
00:09:35,061 --> 00:09:37,162
have lived in the nascar era?

209
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,794
Dr. Franklin, your new
steam engine is here.

210
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,516
I ain't no stinking steam engine!

211
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:50,798
Chicken's ready.

212
00:09:50,964 --> 00:09:52,287
You may go, Louisa.

213
00:09:52,412 --> 00:09:53,779
Now I get it.

214
00:09:59,318 --> 00:10:01,562
Fascinating.
Be you man or machine?

215
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,896
Mostly machine. Might be
a couple of dead cats in there.

216
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,268
Dr. Franklin, with all due respect

217
00:10:07,393 --> 00:10:10,305
to the brilliant
inventor of the... stove,

218
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,904
I must speak with you.
Hmm?

219
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,501
I'm looking for the scoundrel
who made this.

220
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,113
Intricate filigree, satanic symbols.

221
00:10:19,238 --> 00:10:20,954
Looks like one of mine.

222
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,582
But no, this is a fake!

223
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:28,253
Duh. It says "colony
of Maffachufetts."

224
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,797
More like Taxachufetts.

225
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,996
That's just how we print "s"s,
you ftupid fhitheads.

226
00:10:35,121 --> 00:10:37,198
Someone must have used my press

227
00:10:37,323 --> 00:10:39,267
while I was poking
around in Charlotte.

228
00:10:39,392 --> 00:10:41,808
Let's ask my apprentice,
David Farnsworth.

229
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,204
Farnsworth?!

230
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:45,812
That's him!
Arm yourselves!

231
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,568
I call it the Franklinator.

232
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,417
The apprentice's suite is empty!
He's gone!

233
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,953
Wait. What's that glistening
in the chamber pot?

234
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:00,278
Let's find out!

235
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,392
Bender, do you know
what a chamber pot is?

236
00:11:04,517 --> 00:11:06,384
I don't know, and I don't care.

237
00:11:09,388 --> 00:11:10,999
A Massachusetts halfpenny?

238
00:11:11,124 --> 00:11:12,300
Probably fake, too.

239
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:15,236
There's one way to find out.

240
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:17,496
What?

241
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:20,298
Bender bit a poo penny.
Bender bit a poo penny.

242
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:22,974
Look, 'tis but worthless tin.

243
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,105
Where could Farnsworth have
minted such a high quality fake?

244
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,983
Not here. But, you know,

245
00:11:29,108 --> 00:11:31,285
I have a friend in Boston
who's an expert silversmith.

246
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,211
They could be connected.

247
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,990
There's only like 40 people
who do anything around here.

248
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:38,559
But Boston's 300 Miles away,

249
00:11:38,684 --> 00:11:41,095
and bender kicked our horse to death.

250
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,244
We'll never get there in time.

251
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,401
Unless you have another
invention up your sleeve.

252
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:49,161
Hmm...

253
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:55,400
How is this going
to get us to Boston?

254
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,136
Ow!

255
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:00,982
Stupid Franklin.

256
00:12:01,107 --> 00:12:02,183
I will get you!

257
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,354
Ah, that scrap metal
I ordered is here.

258
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:19,224
I'm 40% scrap metal.

259
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,827
Well, Ben Franklin, my
fellow son of liber...

260
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,896
Teakettles.

261
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,808
Yes, I've made some new teakettles.

262
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:28,843
Perfect for special occasions.

263
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:32,146
Like hanging king George in effigy...

264
00:12:32,271 --> 00:12:35,983
And "h" and "I" are monograms
you can put on those kettles.

265
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,610
What are you looking at,
you British bastards?

266
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,112
Paul, we talked about this.

267
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,828
Mr. Revere, we're looking
for a counterfeiter

268
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:49,397
who minted these smelly halfpennies.

269
00:12:49,522 --> 00:12:52,190
His name is David Farnsworth.

270
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:54,035
Fasworth? I just hired him

271
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,503
for the fall candlestick rush.

272
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:57,195
He's in the foundry this very moment.

273
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:01,032
Everybody, take a Franklinator.

274
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:06,204
Aw, I got a chipmunk.

275
00:13:14,914 --> 00:13:15,914
Hee-yah!

276
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,215
Uh, wha...?

277
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,360
David Farnsworth, I presume?

278
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:21,353
I is Davy Farnsworth.

279
00:13:21,758 --> 00:13:23,498
Foof. You're a disgrace
to the very name

280
00:13:23,623 --> 00:13:25,023
"Farnsworth."

281
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,902
Look out. He's got
a bezelling planisher.

282
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:29,127
That's rig.

283
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,838
Who wants to be bezelled?

284
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,441
You idiot.
I'm not a Cannon.

285
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,815
Huh. I guess I am a Cannon.

286
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:53,828
Time to prune the family tree.

287
00:13:53,953 --> 00:13:55,251
Wha!

288
00:13:58,257 --> 00:13:59,367
Huzzah!

289
00:13:59,492 --> 00:14:02,270
I've saved the Farnsworth name.

290
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:05,497
Urgent message for Mr. Revere.

291
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,808
"Mr. Revere,

292
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:09,210
"pray do not 'fhit' your pants.

293
00:14:09,335 --> 00:14:11,012
"The British attack has begun.

294
00:14:11,137 --> 00:14:13,214
Cross the river and
watch for my signal."

295
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:14,372
I must ride.

296
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:19,320
He has so much stuff.

297
00:14:19,445 --> 00:14:21,346
He won't miss this.

298
00:14:23,215 --> 00:14:25,026
Let's burn these counterfeits

299
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:28,320
and paddle the next swan boat
the hell out of Boston.

300
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:30,322
Here you go.
Thanks.

301
00:14:32,996 --> 00:14:35,836
Say, where did you get that lantern?

302
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:39,030
From that old church to the north.

303
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,800
They had two burning, so I
figured they wouldn't miss one.

304
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:45,170
"One if by land, two if by sea."

305
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:50,809
The British are coming.
The British are coming.

306
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,286
By land. By land.

307
00:14:52,411 --> 00:14:54,946
Gotta treat this OCD.
Gotta treat this OCD.

308
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:04,398
Fry, you dope.

309
00:15:04,523 --> 00:15:06,701
You've really screwed
the grannie this time.

310
00:15:06,826 --> 00:15:08,769
History needed that second lantern.

311
00:15:08,894 --> 00:15:11,577
We'd better stop
Paul revere before...

312
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,775
I guess everything worked out

313
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,444
jolly all right, eh, governor?

314
00:15:18,537 --> 00:15:20,281
What's with
the fruity accent, ducky?

315
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:22,416
Bollocks, I got it, too.

316
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,953
Where's all
the presidents heads, then?

317
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:27,321
I say.

318
00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:29,581
Appears we've changed
history too much.

319
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,897
Disaster of nightmarish
proportions and whatnot.

320
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:38,062
Quite.

321
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,662
Where have you blokes been?

322
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,779
You nearly missed elevenses.

323
00:15:56,904 --> 00:15:58,958
Who's for tea and shmavouries?

324
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,917
What in bloody hell's going
on around here, I says.

325
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:05,923
Indeed. What's become
of the dear old usa?

326
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:06,913
Beg pardon?

327
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:08,357
The revolution?

328
00:16:08,482 --> 00:16:11,429
1776 and what all?

329
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,662
Oh, the colonial dustup.

330
00:16:13,787 --> 00:16:15,764
Well, there's nothing
we brits enjoy more

331
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:17,566
than a good documentary.

332
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:19,812
Turn on the tellyvisor,
Dr. Zoidsmythe.

333
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:21,970
I'll dial up the beeb.

334
00:16:22,095 --> 00:16:24,530
They've always got
a nice docky-wocky on.

335
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:28,844
<i>The vanquished pride
of the Yankees,</i>

336
00:16:28,969 --> 00:16:32,158
<i>or, America the dutiful.</i>

337
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,417
<i>North America, or west britannia</i>

338
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:37,920
<i>as we now call it,
has been under British rule</i>

339
00:16:38,045 --> 00:16:41,657
<i>for 1400 years,
all thanks to a nutter</i>

340
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:44,493
<i>known as "wrong-way revere."</i>

341
00:16:44,618 --> 00:16:47,362
The British are coming
by land, by land.

342
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:51,385
<i>But we came by sea, we did.</i>

343
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:53,804
<i>Surprised the yanks at Lexington,</i>

344
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,391
<i>ending the rebellion
with nary a kipper scuffed.</i>

345
00:16:57,557 --> 00:16:58,807
Scuffed kippers, anyone?

346
00:16:58,932 --> 00:17:02,605
Right kind of you, mum.

347
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,780
<i>The humiliated conspirators</i>

348
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:07,777

the declaration of dependence,</i>

349
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:11,010
<i>proclaiming British rule forever.</i>

350
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,855
<i>Meanwhile, a loyal brit</i>

351
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,490
<i>by the name of David Farnsworth</i>

352
00:17:15,615 --> 00:17:17,926
<i>tracked down the traitor
George Washington,</i>

353
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:20,896
<i>and bravely smothered him
with his wig.</i>

354
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:24,752
Oh, criminy.

355
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:28,871
<i>In gratitude, king George
named Farnsworth a Duke</i>

356
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:33,399
<i>and granted his family massive
land-holdings in the colonies.</i>

357
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,477
Blimey. I've never felt

358
00:17:35,602 --> 00:17:38,213
so ashamed to be a Farnsworth.

359
00:17:38,338 --> 00:17:39,781
Will my lord be returning

360
00:17:39,906 --> 00:17:41,741
to his massive
land-holdings for luncheon?

361
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,142
Huh, wha?

362
00:17:51,651 --> 00:17:53,562
I know we're ladies-in-waiting,

363
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:55,264
but what are we waiting for?

364
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,565
How should I know?

365
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,577
Just shut up and wait.

366
00:17:58,743 --> 00:18:01,770
Say, how is it that we've
got socialized medicine,

367
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:04,417
but me teeth still look like this?

368
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,842
Can't we just go back in time,
and set things right again?

369
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:08,610
Don't want to.

370
00:18:08,735 --> 00:18:11,604
Rather nice, living under
the crown and so forth.

371
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,706
Rather. Oh!

372
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,885
What's more, couldn't go back,
even if we wanted to.

373
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,354
No more crystalline opal left

374
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:21,514
in all the world, don't you know.

375
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:24,226
My lord, the queen is here

376
00:18:24,351 --> 00:18:26,719
for her weekly, er, visit.

377
00:18:27,063 --> 00:18:28,020
The queen?

378
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,589
Sounds most satisfactory.

379
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,234
All of you, out.

380
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:33,769
Right then.

381
00:18:33,894 --> 00:18:36,896
Let's go play some quoits,
whatever that is.

382
00:18:37,198 --> 00:18:38,573
♪ ♪

383
00:18:38,698 --> 00:18:41,009
Presenting the queen of england,

384
00:18:41,134 --> 00:18:44,846
America,
and two parking spaces in Tokyo.

385
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:47,907
Where's me consort at?

386
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,254
C-consort?

387
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:52,487
That's right, love.

388

Fer centuries, the
Farnsworth gentlemen

389
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:56,510
has provided service to the queen.

390
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:59,118
Now, close your eyes
and think of england.

391
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,787
I say.

392
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:03,789
What's that in your crown?

393
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:05,801
You mean the andamooka opal?

394
00:19:05,926 --> 00:19:08,189
That's the most precious
gem in all the...

395
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,338
Yes.

396
00:19:09,463 --> 00:19:10,806
Three rubbers on the hobb.

397
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:13,866
Stop him!

398
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:17,369
He crowned me in the knickers
and nicked me crown.

399
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:21,283
Freeze.

400
00:19:21,408 --> 00:19:23,251
Or we'll be forced
to continue chasing you,

401
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:24,920
since we don't carry guns.

402
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:26,912
Indubitably.

403
00:19:29,082 --> 00:19:31,493
We've got to go back in time
and set things straight.

404
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:33,919
Hurry up and lick
Washington's head again.

405
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:36,331
We can't. There's
no George Washington

406
00:19:36,456 --> 00:19:37,990
nor any other presidents.

407
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,601
What about this bloke?

408
00:19:39,726 --> 00:19:43,028
He's from revolutionary times.

409
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,997
Farnsworth.

410
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:47,609
Hey, you're the plonkers
what candlesticked me.

411
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:49,268
Well, I showed you.

412
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:50,912
I killed George Washington,

413
00:19:51,037 --> 00:19:53,281
and now I'm married
to one of the spice girls.

414
00:19:53,406 --> 00:19:55,074
Don't rightly know which one.

415
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,410
Bender, fetch me that powdered opal.

416
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,564
It's time to restore dignity
to the Farnsworth name.

417
00:20:09,689 --> 00:20:11,757
Ew!

418
00:20:15,729 --> 00:20:17,429
There.

419
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:19,975
That time I left
both lanterns in place.

420
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,978
And I hit Farnsworth
much, much harder.

421
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:25,171
Perhaps too hard.

422
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,015
Look, all the presidents are back.

423
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,008
Even John Tyler.

424
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:31,620
That's the first time anyone's spoken

425
00:20:31,745 --> 00:20:34,689
to me in 1,200 years.

426
00:20:34,814 --> 00:20:38,493
Yes, from Chester A. Arthur
to Chester Z. Arthur,

427
00:20:38,618 --> 00:20:40,319
they're all here.

428
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:41,797
Our Republic

429
00:20:41,922 --> 00:20:45,491
and the Farnsworth
family name are saved.

430
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:48,155
And no one will ever know.
