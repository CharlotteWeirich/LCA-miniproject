Long ago,the four nations lived together in harmony

6
00:00:13,548 --> 00:00:17,841
then everything changed when the firenation attacked

7
00:00:19,137 --> 00:00:22,787
Only the avatar mastered all four elements could stop them

8
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:25,867
but when the world needed him most he vanished

9
00:00:26,874 --> 00:00:29,923
100 years passed, my brother and I discovered the new avatar

10
00:00:30,213 --> 00:00:31,936
airbinder named Aang

11
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:34,436
And although his airbinding skill is great,

12
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:37,222
he has a lot to learn before he is ready to save anyone.

13
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,939
but I believe...
... Aang can save the world

I can't believe we finally made it to Ba Sing Se in one piece.

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,866
I just want our new place to look nice, in case someone brings home a lady friend.

18
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:01,525
I don't want to make a life here.

19
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:04,477
Here we are, your new home.

20
00:01:04,527 --> 00:01:06,603
We need to talk to the King about the war.

21
00:01:06,647 --> 00:01:12,203
Your request for an audience with the Earth King is being processed, and should be put through in about a month.

22
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:16,013
If we are going to be here for a month, we should spend our time looking for Appa.

Toph, aren't you gonna to get ready for the day?

26
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,790
I'm ready.

27
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,998
You're not gonna wash up? You've got a little dirt on your...

28
00:02:00,437 --> 00:02:02,437
...everywhere actually.

29
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,430
You call it dirt. I call it a healthy coating of earth.

30
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:08,497
Hmmm. You know what we need?

31
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,697
A girl's day out!

32
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:12,461
Do I have to?

33
00:02:12,993 --> 00:02:14,093
It'll be fun.

34
00:02:18,798 --> 00:02:22,898
The Fancy Lady Day Spa? Sounds like my kinda place.

35
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:25,299
Are you ready for some serious pampering?

36
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:27,102
Sure Katara,

37
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,956
whatever you say. As long as they don't touch my feet.

38
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,150
Well, that wasn't so bad.

39
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:11,322
I'm not usually into that stuff, but I actually feel...

40
00:03:11,623 --> 00:03:13,123
...girly

41
00:03:13,124 --> 00:03:14,124
I'm glad,

42
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,125
it's about time we did something fun together.

43
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:23,541
Great makeup.

44
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Thanks.

45
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:26,325
For a clown!

46
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,970
Don't listen to them, let's just keep walking.

47
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:36,371
I think she looks cute. Like that time we put that sweater on your pet poodle monkey.

48
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,385
Good one, Star!

49
00:03:41,543 --> 00:03:43,600
Let's go Toph.

50
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:47,667
No, no. That was a good one! "Like your poodle-monkey"?

51
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:51,281
You know what else is a good one?

52
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:57,015
Now that was funny.

53
00:04:00,764 --> 00:04:02,764
Those girls don't know what they're talking about.

54
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:06,272
It's ok. One of the good things about being blind is ...

55
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,748
...I don't have to waste my time worrying about appearances.

56
00:04:09,402 --> 00:04:13,402
I don't care what I look like. I'm not looking for anyone's approval.

57
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:14,963
I know who I am.

58
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:18,253
That's what I really admire about you, Toph.

59
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:21,565
You're so strong and confidant and self assured. And ...

60
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,330
I know it doesn't matter, but...you're really pretty.

61
00:04:27,548 --> 00:04:28,548
I am?

62
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:29,876
Yeah. You are.

63
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:38,656
I'd return the compliment, but I have no idea what you look like.

64
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:40,978
Thank you, Katara.

If this is for a romantic picnic, may I suggest this lavender one?

67
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:02,771
No, it is not a romantic picnic,

68
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:04,941
but it is a special occasion.

69
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:16,448
The moonflower likes partial shade.

Brave soldier boy,

77
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:02,685
comes marching home.

78
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,079
It is usually best to admit mistakes when they occur,

79
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,822
and to seek to restore honor.

80
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:38,521
When I am through with you kids, the window won't be the only thing that's broken!

81
00:06:38,943 --> 00:06:40,943
But not this time. Run!

82
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,242
You.

83
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:52,022
Give me all your money!

84
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,043
What are you doing?

85
00:06:57,471 --> 00:06:58,471
I'm mugging you!

86
00:06:58,868 --> 00:06:59,868
With that stance?

87
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:02,018
What? What are you talking about?

88
00:07:02,365 --> 00:07:03,865
Just give me your money, old man!

89
00:07:05,018 --> 00:07:10,059
With a poor stance you are unbalanced, and you can be easily knocked over.

90
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,017
With a solid stance, you are a much more serious threat.

91
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:28,543
Much better!

92
00:07:28,591 --> 00:07:32,796
But to tell you the truth, you do not look like the criminal type.

93
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:36,438
I know. I'm...I'm just confused.

94
00:07:39,237 --> 00:07:41,800
So you really think I could be a good masseur?

95
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:42,906
Of course!

96
00:07:44,651 --> 00:07:47,651
This is so great! No one has ever believed in me.

97
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:51,355
While it is always best to believe in one's self,

98
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:55,942
a little help from others can be a great blessing.

99
00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:22,286
Happy Birthday my son.

Hm! They are hungry.

110
00:09:45,894 --> 00:09:48,894
The Dai Li won't give me any money because the kids stopped coming.

111
00:09:49,648 --> 00:09:52,648
And the kids won't come because my zoo's nasty and broke.

112
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:54,394
What kind of animal is that?

113
00:09:54,832 --> 00:09:59,019
Oh, that's rabbiroo. I wish I could get her a big open prairie like she likes.

114
00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:01,489
I'd let her hop her way to happiness.

Say again?

117

There's a big open space right outside the walls of the city.

118
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:11,629
But how are you gonna transport all these wild critters?

119

Don't worry. I'm great with animals.

This was so much easier in my head!

123
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:27,230
But you have to open this gate!

124
00:11:27,824 --> 00:11:28,824
Or what?

125
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,090
Or that!

126
00:11:33,411 --> 00:11:34,411
Open the gate!

127
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,810
Well, Mr. Zookeeper, how do you like your new facilities?

128
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:37,250
Excellent job, Avatar.

129

You should think about working with animals for a living.

You're right Zuko.

165
00:15:54,618 --> 00:15:56,618
I've seen that girl in here quite a lot.

166
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:00,332
Seems to me she has quite a little crush on you.

167
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,730
What?

168
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:02,955
Thank you for the tea.

169
00:16:05,456 --> 00:16:06,456
What's your name?

170
00:16:06,978 --> 00:16:09,978
My name's Lee. My Uncle and I just moved here.

171
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:12,033
Hi Lee, my name is Jin.

172
00:16:12,912 --> 00:16:14,912
Thank you and, well,

173
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:18,282
I was wondering if you would like to go out sometime?

174
00:16:18,972 --> 00:16:19,972
He'd love to!

175
00:16:20,423 --> 00:16:23,423
Great! I will meet you in front of the shop at sundown.

176
00:16:36,131 --> 00:16:40,131
Hey. Well, look at you. You look so cute!

177
00:16:41,038 --> 00:16:43,038
It took my Uncle ten minutes to do my hair.

178
00:16:48,827 --> 00:16:51,327
So, how do you like the city so far?

179
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:52,531
It's ok.

180
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:54,897
What do you like to do for fun?

181
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:56,042
Nothing

182
00:16:56,178 --> 00:16:59,178
Excuse me sir. Would you and your girlfriend care for dessert?

183
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:01,532
She is not my girlfriend!

184
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:11,200
You have... quite an appetite for a girl.

185
00:17:11,255 --> 00:17:12,636
Thanks...

186
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,656
So, Lee, where were you and your Uncle living before you came here?

187
00:17:20,227 --> 00:17:23,645
Well, we've been traveling around for a long time.

188
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:26,092
Why were you traveling so much?

189
00:17:26,685 --> 00:17:30,162
We were uh, apart of this traveling circus.

190
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:33,761
Really? What did you do? Wait, lemme guess,

191
00:17:34,657 --> 00:17:35,738
you juggled!

192
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:38,448
Yes. I juggled.

193
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:41,467
I've always wanted to learn how to juggle. Can you show me something?

194
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:52,059
I haven't practiced for awhile.

195
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,360
It's alright.

196
00:17:54,147 --> 00:17:58,073
Hey, I want to show you one of my favorite places in the city.

197
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,184
I'm so excited for you to see the firelight fountain.

198
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:06,440
The lamps make the water sparkle and reflect in the pool in the most beautiful way.

199
00:18:09,341 --> 00:18:11,323
I can't believe it! They arn't lit.

200
00:18:15,772 --> 00:18:17,599
Close your eyes and don't peak.

201
00:18:35,776 --> 00:18:37,771
Ok. Now you can look.

202
00:18:43,885 --> 00:18:47,163
What happened? How did they light? What did you..

203
00:18:58,712 --> 00:18:59,730
I brought you something.

204
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:02,151
It's a coupon for a free cup of tea.

205
00:19:03,148 --> 00:19:05,482
Lee, this is so sweet.

206
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:10,449
Don't thank me. It was my Uncle's idea. He thinks you're our most valuable customer.

207
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:12,200
Your Uncle is a good teacher.

208
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:17,775
I have something for you too.  Now it's your turn to close your eyes.

209
00:19:26,784 --> 00:19:27,733
What's wrong?

210
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:28,734
It's complicated.

211
00:19:29,581 --> 00:19:30,612
I have to go.

212
00:19:42,209 --> 00:19:44,282
How was your night Prince Zuko?

213
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:50,518
It was nice.

214
