Yeah, now I'm water-cooled.

185
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:23,965
I can stimulate my intellect

thermodynamical disruption.

Aah!

In fact, looking ahead, it's obvious

Mom won't allow me

Anyone have access
to a lofty realm of gravy?

I can conceive of gravies that would
boggle your tiny mind!

00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:42,749
But it's not safe here,
so I'll need to find a hideout.

00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,879
Hideout? Bender, are you becoming

What are you, Randy,

Well, if he's running

Power? Liquid coolant?

Randy?! Have you been

307
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,962
Please, Bender. If everything
is a chess game for you,

308
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,910
you must know how to help me.

309
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:32,634
I'm sorry, Fry, but some games
you just can't win.

310
00:14:32,702 --> 00:14:34,536
Cubert and the Professor are guilty.

311
00:14:34,604 --> 00:14:36,305
The jury will vote to convict.

312
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:38,007
I can't change that.

313
00:14:38,074 --> 00:14:39,942
Well, what about Leela?

314
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,012
Is there any hope things could
still work out between us?

315
00:14:47,017 --> 00:14:48,851
It's getting late.

316
00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:50,486
Now if you'll excuse me,

00:14:50,553 --> 00:14:53,288

Not only have the defendants
failed to rebut the charges,

323
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,499
It strikes me

00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:29,220
he would testify that my
clients acted without malice.

328
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,626
No, he wouldn't.

329
00:15:30,693 --> 00:15:31,927
Bender doesn't care about us anymore.

330
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:37,299
Someone used to care
about me? Hooray!

331
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:40,536
In that case, the jury
will begin its deliberations.

332
00:15:40,603 --> 00:15:44,610
Bailiff, release the jury collies.

333
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:52,481
I finally nailed Farnsworth.

334
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:55,454
Destroying the boy
is just icing on the cake.

335
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,619
No one destroys a boy
like you, Mother.

336
00:15:57,687 --> 00:16:00,960
Thank you, you
repulsive disappointment.

337
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,591
Any word from Leela?

338
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:05,131
I heard she took a job
selling deep space real estate,

339
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,929
somewhere beyond
the most distant thing

340
00:16:06,996 --> 00:16:08,497
ever observed with a telescope.

341
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:12,555
She always liked not being
observed with a telescope.

342
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:21,477
Order! Order in the head!

343
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:24,847
For reasons beyond
even my comprehension,

344
00:16:24,914 --> 00:16:28,404
I have returned to testify
on behalf of the defendants.

345
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,281
- Yay!
- Yeah, Bender!

346
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,121
I knew he cared about us!

347
00:16:32,188 --> 00:16:34,356
You said you knew he
<i>didn't</i> care about us.

348
00:16:34,424 --> 00:16:35,911
Leave me alone.

349
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:38,748
Your Honor, I object to
this surprise witness.

350
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,124
He's too surprising.

351
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,710
Sustained! Testimony has closed.

352
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,004
But, Your Honor...
<i>Silence!</i>

353
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,802
One more inburst like that,

354
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,425
and I'll have this courtroom
removed from you!

355
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,609
I... I'm sorry, guys.

356
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:54,930
I didn't realize

357
00:16:55,096 --> 00:16:56,345
I was late.

358
00:16:56,412 --> 00:16:58,100
I guess I'm not as smart
as everybody thought.

359
00:16:58,266 --> 00:17:00,782
I was born in prison,
and I'll die in prison.

360
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,351
There is still one hope.

361
00:17:02,418 --> 00:17:04,065
You're co-defendants,

362
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,522
and the jury might not want
to convict a 12-year-old.

363
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:07,985
Son of a nerd!

364
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:09,111
He may be right.

365
00:17:09,277 --> 00:17:10,726
Make sure Farnsworth

366
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:13,162
doesn't get off easy on account
of that snot-gobbling twerp!

367
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,799
Has the jury reached a verdict?

368
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:21,540
Not just any verdict,
Your Honor. A great verdict!

369
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,507
They're going to take pity on him!

370
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:26,842
Do something!

371
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,144
Your Honor, prosecution moves

372
00:17:29,212 --> 00:17:31,926
to drop the charges
against Cubert Farnsworth.

373
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:34,950
Very well.

374
00:17:35,018 --> 00:17:38,265
The case against Cubert
Farnsworth is hereby dismissed.

375
00:17:38,431 --> 00:17:40,476
Told you I'd get away with it.

376
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,057
That'll do, pig.

377
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,855
Please read the verdict
against Professor Farnsworth.

378
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:46,107
You got it, Judge.

379
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,529
I think you'll find this verdict

380
00:17:47,597 --> 00:17:48,997
as fair as it is cruel.

381
00:17:49,065 --> 00:17:50,569
Your Honor,

382
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:53,835
I move for a mistrial
on grounds of double jeopardy!

383
00:17:53,903 --> 00:17:55,837
Cubert Farnsworth
cannot be tried twice

384
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:57,368
for the same crime.

385
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,376
Cubert is the Professor's clone,

386
00:18:01,444 --> 00:18:04,146
ergo they are legally
the same person.

387
00:18:04,214 --> 00:18:06,315
Since you dismissed
the charges against Cubert,

388
00:18:06,382 --> 00:18:09,588
you cannot convict the Professor
of these same charges!

389
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:11,486
Well, I'll be a nugget's uncle.

390
00:18:11,554 --> 00:18:12,883
He's right!

391
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:14,990
What a brilliant legal shenanigan.

392
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:17,471
Case dismissed!

393
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,437
Bender, you knew all this
would happen, didn't you?

394
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,856
Yes. All except this part.

395
00:18:28,104 --> 00:18:29,771
Ow!

396
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:31,873
If I can't bring down Farnsworth,

397
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:33,709
I can at least dumb down his robot.

398
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:37,212
Take him away and reset him
to factory-stupid condition!

399
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,249
Bender, wait!

400
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:42,784
While you can still calculate
the future, just tell me...

401
00:18:42,852 --> 00:18:44,457
what's gonna happen
with me and Leela?

402
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,021
There's no time now.

403
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:47,835
Quick, Zoidberg!

404
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,792
Take three steps to your right!

405
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,131
Oh!

406
00:18:56,259 --> 00:19:00,369
Oh, we've had some tough times,
but at least we won a Tony.

407
00:19:00,436 --> 00:19:02,725
<i>You</i> won a Tony. Feh.

408
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:06,141
Wow. You gave up your
super-intelligence to save us.

409
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:07,943
Why did you come back?

410
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:10,812
Honestly, I couldn't
think of one good reason,

411
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,028
but some decisions
can't be made by thinking.

412
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,418
Even if you're drunk.

413
00:19:17,687 --> 00:19:19,254
No galaxies there.

414
00:19:19,322 --> 00:19:20,589
Knock, knock.

415
00:19:20,657 --> 00:19:21,923
Oh! Oh!
Who's there?

416
00:19:21,991 --> 00:19:23,992
Leela?!

417
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,456
Leela who?

418
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,624
It's good to see you.

419
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,667
Is it good to see me?

420
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,170
- Of course.
- Come on in, Leela.

421
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,713
Take that ugly coat off.

422
00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:34,403
Thanks.
Hi, everybody.

423
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,800
So tell us,

424
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,106
how's the intergalactic
real estate going?

425
00:19:38,174 --> 00:19:41,388
Pretty good. I just sold
a castle to the King of Space.

426
00:19:41,554 --> 00:19:43,945
But somehow, I keep finding myself

427
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:47,115
thinking about this place...
and things.

428
00:19:47,183 --> 00:19:50,385
Things like me, or things
like this badminton racquet?

429
00:19:50,453 --> 00:19:51,899
You, Fry.

430
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,890
Bender, while you still have
your giant brain,

431
00:19:54,957 --> 00:19:58,197
please, tell me if Fry and I
ended up together.

432
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,661
It's too late, Leela.

433
00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:01,196
He's good old Bender again.

434
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:02,664
He's totally useless.

435
00:20:02,732 --> 00:20:03,999
Well, not totally.

436
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:06,301
Before they reset me,
I figured out the answers

437
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:07,669
to life's great questions.

438
00:20:07,737 --> 00:20:09,705
Uh, this is the reason we exist.

439
00:20:09,772 --> 00:20:12,207
This is which ceiling fans
are gonna fall.

440
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:14,009
Aha! Found it!

441
00:20:14,077 --> 00:20:17,716
"Fry and Leela's Ultimate Fate.
By Bender."

442
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:18,676
Uh...

443
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,515
It's probably better
if we don't know.

444
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,417
Uh, mystery of life and whatnot.

445
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:24,720
Give me that!

446
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:57,339
