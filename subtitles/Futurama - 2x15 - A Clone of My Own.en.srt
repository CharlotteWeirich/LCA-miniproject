FARNSWORTH: <i>These are</i>
<i>the dark-matter engines I invented. </i>

174
00:09:59,453 --> 00:10:03,969
They allow my starship to travel
between galaxies in mere hours.

175
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:07,649
That's impossible. You can't go faster
than the speed of light.

176
00:10:07,893 --> 00:10:12,648
Of course not. That's why scientists
increased the speed of light in 2208.

177
00:10:12,893 --> 00:10:14,212
Also impossible.

178
00:10:14,453 --> 00:10:17,843
And what makes my engines truly
remarkable is the afterburner...

179
00:10:18,093 --> 00:10:20,561
...which delivers 200-percent
fuel efficiency.

180
00:10:20,813 --> 00:10:22,565
That's especially impossible.

181
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:24,889
Not at all. It's very simple.

Nothing's impossible

is all about.

312
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:21,173
No one knows how it works!
It's impossible!

313
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:24,843
Nothing is impossible!
I know how the engines work now.

314
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:26,446
It came to me in a dream.

315
00:19:26,693 --> 00:19:28,843
The engines don't move
the ship at all!

316
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:33,086
The ship stays where it is, and the
engines move the universe around it!

317
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,482
That's a complete load.

318
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:37,645
Nothing's a complete load.
Not if you can imagine it.

319
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:40,726
That's what being a scientist
is about. Right, professor?

320
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:42,252
[GIBBERISH]

321
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:43,882
Let's ride.

322
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:00,165
QBERT:
<i>Good news, everyone! </i>

323
00:20:00,413 --> 00:20:01,892
He's completely recovered.

324
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:03,248
- All right!
- Yeah.

325
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,405
I'm as spry as a 140-year-old.

326
00:20:06,653 --> 00:20:08,848
See? I only broke one ankle.

327
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:11,163
What happened to you in the drawer?

328
00:20:11,373 --> 00:20:16,288
I was hooked up to a bizarre virtual
world that seemed absolutely real.

329
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:19,771
- What was it like?
- I was at a facility in Florida...

330
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:22,163
...with hundreds of other old people.

331
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:26,764
All day we'd play bingo, eat oatmeal
and wait for our children to call.

332
00:20:27,213 --> 00:20:30,569
It's more horrible
than anything I could imagine.

333
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,373
Oh, my, yes.
Thank you all for saving me.

334
00:20:33,573 --> 00:20:35,803
Especially you, my little clone.

335
00:20:36,053 --> 00:20:40,763
No matter what you decide to do with
your life, I'm still proud of you.

336
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,964
I've already decided.

337
00:20:43,173 --> 00:20:47,086
Dad, when I grow up
I want to be just like you.

338
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,370
Oh, don't worry, son. You will.

339
00:20:50,613 --> 00:20:55,368
Incidentally, read up on the condition
known as wandering bladder.

340
00:20:55,573 --> 00:20:56,688
Why?

341
00:20:56,933 --> 00:21:00,482
FARNSWORTH:
<i>No reason. No reason at all. </i>
