<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:27,097 --> 00:00:31,175
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:31,376 --> 00:00:35,488
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:38,648
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:42,810
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:44,650
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:46,856
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:46,857 --> 00:00:50,589
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,212
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

Book One: Water
Chapter Four: The Warriors of Kyoshi

15
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:30,150
The only reason you should be interrupting me is if you have news about the Avatar.

16
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:35,827
Well, there is news, Prince Zuko, but you might not like it. Don't get too upset.

17
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:39,875
Uncle, you taught me that keeping a level head is a sign of a great leader.

18
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:42,714
Now whatever you have to say, I'm sure that I can take it.

19
00:01:42,715 --> 00:01:46,749
Okay, then... we have no idea where he is.

20
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,161
What?!

21
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:51,349
You really should open a window in here.

22
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,457
Give me the map!

23
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,873
Ah, There have been multiple sightings of the Avatar,...

24
00:01:55,874 --> 00:01:59,073
...but he is impossible to track down.

25
00:01:59,074 --> 00:02:00,547
How am I gonna find him, Uncle?

26
00:02:00,548 --> 00:02:05,319
He is clearly a master of evasive maneuvering.

27
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,153
You have no idea where you're going, do you?

28
00:02:08,154 --> 00:02:10,697
Weeelll, I know it's near water...

29
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:13,462
I guess we're getting close then.

30
00:02:15,048 --> 00:02:18,302
Momo, marbles please.

31
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:23,928
Hey Katara! Check out this airbending trick!

32
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:27,306
That's great, Aang.

33
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:29,838
You didn't even look.

34
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:31,122
That's great!

35
00:02:31,123 --> 00:02:32,670
But I'm not doing it now.

36
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:36,384
Stop bugging her, airhead. You need to give girls space when they do their sewing.

37
00:02:36,385 --> 00:02:40,012
What does me being a girl have to do with sewing?

38
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:42,579
Simple, girls are better at fixing pants than guys,...

39
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,215
...and guys are better at hunting and fighting and stuff like that.

40
00:02:45,216 --> 00:02:46,724
It's just the natural order of things.

41
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:51,728
All done with your pants! And look what a great job I did!

42
00:02:52,456 --> 00:02:56,650
Wait! I was just kidding! I can't wear these! Katara, please!

43
00:02:56,651 --> 00:03:01,057
Relax, Sokka. Where we're going, you won't need any pants!

44
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:07,590
We just made a pit stop yesterday.

45
00:03:07,591 --> 00:03:10,477
Shouldn't we get a little more flying done before we camp out?

46
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:13,909
He's right. At this rate we won't get to the North Pole until spring.

47
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:22,194
But Appa's tired already, aren't you boy? I said, aren't you boy?

48
00:03:22,895 --> 00:03:28,914
Yeah, that was real convincing. Still, hard to argue with a ten ton magical monster.

49
00:03:28,915 --> 00:03:30,759
Look!

50
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,607
That's why we're here...

51
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:40,548
...elephant koi. And I'm going to ride it. Katara, you've gotta watch me!

52
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:45,204
Cold!

53
00:04:09,288 --> 00:04:10,855
He looks pretty good out there.

54
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:13,959
Are you kidding? The fish is doing all the work.

55
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,453
No, Appa! Don't eat that!

56
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,613
Aww, man...

57
00:04:28,254 --> 00:04:29,751
There's something in the water!

58
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:35,459
What's wrong?

59
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,260
Aang's in trouble. Aang!

60
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:39,366
Get out of there!

61
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:42,665
- Come back here! Aang!
- Aang

62
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:06,757
What was that thing?

63
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:07,928
I don't know.

64
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:12,263
Well, let's not stick around and find out. Time to hit the road.

65
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:25,926
Or we could stay a while...

66
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:32,560
You three have some explaining to do.

67
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:34,691
And if you don't answer all our questions,...

68
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:37,113
...we're throwing you back in the water with the unagi.

69
00:05:37,114 --> 00:05:40,389
Show yourselves, cowards!

70
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:44,491
Who are you? Where are the men who ambushed us?

71
00:05:44,492 --> 00:05:46,857
There were no men. We ambushed you.

72
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:49,619
Now tell us, who are you and what are you doing here?

73
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,796
Wait a second, there's no way that a bunch of girls took us down.

74
00:05:52,797 --> 00:05:57,137
A bunch of girls, huh? The unagi's gonna eat well tonight.

75
00:05:57,138 --> 00:06:02,256
No, don't hurt him! He didn't mean it. My brother is just an idiot sometimes.

76
00:06:02,257 --> 00:06:07,006
It's my fault. I'm sorry we came here. I wanted to ride the elephant koi.

77
00:06:07,007 --> 00:06:10,418
How do we know you're not Fire Nation spies?

78
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:15,149
Kyoshi stayed out of the war so far. And we intend to keep it that way!

79
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,803
This island is named for Kyoshi? I know Kyoshi!

80
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:21,907
Ha! How could you possibly know her?

81
00:06:21,908 --> 00:06:29,338
Avatar Kyoshi was born here four hundred years ago. She's been dead for centuries.

82
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:31,914
I know her because I'm the Avatar.

83
00:06:31,915 --> 00:06:33,239
That's impossible!

84
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,888
The last Avatar was an airbender who disappeared a hundred years ago.

85
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:37,945
That's me!

86
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:41,711
Throw the imposter to the unagi!

87
00:06:43,547 --> 00:06:47,095
Aang... do some airbending...

88
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,772
It's true... you are the Avatar!

89
00:06:56,773 --> 00:07:00,390
Now... check this out!

90
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:11,314
Did you hear the news? The Avatar's on Kyoshi!

91
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:13,600
Huh?

92
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,074
The Avatar's on Kyoshi Island?

93
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:27,190
Uncle, ready the rhinos. He's not getting away from me this time.

94
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:29,193
Are you going to finish that?

95
00:07:29,194 --> 00:07:32,303
I was going to save it for later!

96
00:07:49,326 --> 00:07:55,542
All right! Dessert for breakfast! These people sure know how to treat an Avatar!

97
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:57,921
Mmm... Katara you've got to try these!

98
00:07:57,922 --> 00:08:00,316
Well, maybe just a bite...

99
00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:04,975
Sokka, what's your problem? Eat!

100
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:06,000
Not hungry.

101
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:07,917
But you're always hungry!

102
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,653
He's just upset because a bunch of girls kicked his butt yesterday.

103
00:08:11,654 --> 00:08:13,129
They snuck up on me!

104
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,710
Right. And then they kicked your butt.

105
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:17,529
Sneak attacks don't count!

106
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:23,099
Tie me up with ropes! I'll show them a thing or two. I'm not scared of any girls.

107
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,615
Who do they think they are anyway? Mmm... this is tasty.

108
00:08:27,616 --> 00:08:32,696
What's he so angry about? It's great here. They're giving us the royal treatment.

109
00:08:32,697 --> 00:08:37,108
Hey, don't get too comfortable. It's risky for us to stay in one place for very long.

110
00:08:37,109 --> 00:08:41,335
I'm sure we'll be fine. Besides, did you see how happy I'm making this town?

111
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:43,434
They're even cleaning up that statue in my honor!

112
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:46,816
Well, it's nice to see you excited about being the Avatar.

113
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,801
I just hope it doesn't all go to your head.

114
00:08:48,802 --> 00:08:54,224
Come on, you know me better than that. I'm just a simple monk.

115
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:22,909
Painting the Avatar... that's easy enough...

116
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:27,776
Oh... there's another one... I'll make an adjustment here, and...

117
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:30,769
There's more... what...

118
00:10:01,055 --> 00:10:03,684
Sorry ladies! Didn't mean to interrupt your dance lesson.

119
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:06,353
I was just looking for somewhere to get a little workout?

120
00:10:06,354 --> 00:10:09,166
Well, you're in the right place.

121
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:13,044
Sorry about yesterday. I didn't know that you were friends with the Avatar.

122
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,863
It's all right. I mean, normally I'd hold a grudge,...

123
00:10:15,864 --> 00:10:18,816
...but seeing as you guys are a bunch of girls, I'll make an exception.

124
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:24,808
I should hope so. A big strong man like you? We wouldn't stand a chance.

125
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:28,683
True. But don't feel bad. After all, I'm the best warrior in my village.

126
00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:32,470
Wow! Best warrior, huh? In your whole village?

127
00:10:32,471 --> 00:10:36,466
Maybe you'd be kind enough to give us a little demonstration.

128
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:38,569
Oh... well... I mean... I...

129
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:42,879
Come on, girls! Wouldn't you like him to show us some moves?

130
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,289
Well, if that's what you want, I'd be happy to. All right, you stand over there. Now.

131
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,991
This may be a little tough, but try to block me.

132
00:10:54,771 --> 00:10:59,003
Heh heh... good. Of course, I was going easy on you.

133
00:10:59,004 --> 00:11:00,082
Of course.

134
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,947
Let's see if you can handle this!

135
00:11:04,752 --> 00:11:06,879
That does it!

136
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:21,946
Anything else you want to teach us?

137
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:29,858
There she is, girls. Me in a past life.

138
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:34,156
You were pretty!

139
00:11:34,157 --> 00:11:37,562
Excuse me for a second, ladies.

140
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:43,069
Oh, good! Can you help me carry this back to the room? It's a little heavy.

141
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,810
Actually, I can't right now.

142
00:11:44,811 --> 00:11:46,003
What do you mean you can't?

143
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:48,440
I promised the girls that I'd give them a ride on Appa.

144
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,613
Why don't you come with us? It'll be fun!

145
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:54,209
Watching you show off for a bunch of girls does not sound like fun.

146
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,720
Well, neither does carrying your basket.

147
00:11:56,721 --> 00:12:00,238
It's not my basket. These supplies are for our trip.

148
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:02,224
I told you, we have to leave Kyoshi soon.

149
00:12:02,225 --> 00:12:04,280
I don't want to leave Kyoshi yet.

150
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:09,552
I can't put my finger on it, but there's something I really like about this place.

151
00:12:09,553 --> 00:12:12,911
What's taking you so long, Aangy?

152
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:13,771
Aangy...

153
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:15,583
Just a second, Koko!

154
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:17,098
"Simple monk," huh?

155
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:20,451
I thought you promised me that this Avatar stuff wouldn't go to your head.

156
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:22,887
It didn't. You know what I think?

157
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:25,122
You just don't want to come because you're jealous.

158
00:12:25,123 --> 00:12:27,180
Jealous? Of what?

159
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:29,314
Jealous that we're having so much fun without you.

160
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,462
That's ridiculous.

161
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:34,736
It is a little ridiculous, but I understand.

162
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:47,785
Uh... hey, Suki.

163
00:12:47,786 --> 00:12:49,776
Hoping for another dance lesson?

164
00:12:49,777 --> 00:12:52,478
No... I... well, let me explain.

165
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:56,175
Spit it out! What do you want?

166
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,295
I would be honored if you would teach me.

167
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:01,906
Even if I'm a girl?

168
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:05,291
I'm sorry if I insulted you earlier. I was wrong.

169
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:09,256
We normally don't teach outsiders, let alone boys.

170
00:13:09,257 --> 00:13:12,032
Please make an exception. I won't let you down.

171
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:15,820
All right. But you have to follow all of our traditions.

172
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:16,933
Of course!

173
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:20,442
And I mean all of them.

174
00:13:20,443 --> 00:13:24,296
Do I really have to wear this? It feels a little... girly.

175
00:13:24,297 --> 00:13:27,236
It's a warrior's uniform. You should be proud.

176
00:13:27,237 --> 00:13:31,266
The silk threads symbolizes the brave blood that flows through our veins.

177
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:36,110
The gold insignia represents the honor of the warrior's heart.

178
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:38,186
Bravery and honor.

179
00:13:38,187 --> 00:13:41,917
Hey Sokka! Nice dress!

180
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:54,643
Katara, remember how the unagi almost got me yesterday?

181
00:13:54,644 --> 00:13:55,489
Yeah.

182
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,284
Well, I'm gonna go ride it now. It's gonna be real dangerous.

183
00:13:59,285 --> 00:14:00,377
Good for you.

184
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:01,590
You're not going to stop me?

185
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,754
Nope. Have fun.

186
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:03,744
I will.

187
00:14:03,745 --> 00:14:04,302
Great.

188
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,177
I know it's great.

189
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,145
I'm glad you know.

190
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,033
I'm glad you're glad.

191
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:09,501
- Good! - Fine!

192
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,739
You're not going to master it in one day. Even I'm not that good.

193
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,580
I think I'm starting to get it.

194
00:14:30,861 --> 00:14:33,631
It's not about strength.

195
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:38,229
Our technique is about using your opponents' force against them. Loosen up.

196
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,397
Think of the fan as an extension of your arm.

197
00:14:41,398 --> 00:14:44,576
Wait for an opening and then...

198
00:14:48,224 --> 00:14:50,821
I fell on purpose to make you feel better!

199
00:14:50,822 --> 00:14:54,676
I got you! Admit I got you!

200
00:14:54,677 --> 00:15:00,643
Okay, it was a lucky shot. Let's see if you can do it again.

201
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:07,631
What's taking so long?

202
00:15:07,632 --> 00:15:11,556
I'm sure it will be here any second!

203
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:14,356
Um... What about this?

204
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:17,123
Not that again. Boring.

205
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,181
Where's the unagi? It's getting late.

206
00:15:20,182 --> 00:15:22,794
Where're you going? Don't leave!

207
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:27,092
Sorry, Aang! Maybe next time.

208
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:32,148
Katara! You show up!

209
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:35,644
I wanted to make sure you were safe. You really had me worried.

210
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:38,199
Back there you acted like you didn't care.

211
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,346
I'm sorry.

212
00:15:39,347 --> 00:15:44,504
Me too. I did let all that attention go to my head. I was being a jerk.

213
00:15:44,505 --> 00:15:49,060
Well, get out of the water before you catch a cold, you big jerk!

214
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:51,415
On my way!

215
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,656
Hang on, Aang!

216
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:58,930
Aang...!

217
00:17:25,715 --> 00:17:27,764
Zuko!

218
00:17:41,064 --> 00:17:43,858
I want the Avatar alive.

219
00:17:59,074 --> 00:18:01,399
Wake up, Aang!

220
00:18:08,497 --> 00:18:11,360
Katara...

221
00:18:11,361 --> 00:18:17,061
...don't ride the unagi. Not fun.

222
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,662
Not bad.

223
00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:28,768
Firebenders have landed on our shores! Girls, come quickly!

224
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:33,010
Hey, I'm not a... oh, whatever!

225
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:42,588
Come out, Avatar! You can't hide from me forever!

226
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:48,498
Find him.

227
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:27,575
I guess training's over.

228
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,509
Nice try, Avatar! But these little girls can't save you.

229
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,757
Hey! Over here!

230
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:48,865
Finally!

231
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:30,165
Get inside.

232
00:20:33,196 --> 00:20:35,054
Look what I brought to this place.

233
00:20:35,055 --> 00:20:36,330
It's not your fault.

234
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:40,518
Yes, it is. These people got their town destroyed trying to protect me.

235
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:43,918
Then let's get out of here. Zuko will leave Kyoshi to follow us.

236
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,867
I know it feels wrong to run, but I think it's the only way.

237
00:20:47,868 --> 00:20:50,622
I'll call Appa.

238
00:20:56,118 --> 00:20:57,967
There's no time to say goodbye.

239
00:20:57,968 --> 00:20:59,684
What about, "I'm sorry"?

240
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:00,548
For what?

241
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:03,774
I treated you like a girl when I should have treated you like a warrior.

242
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:10,662
I am a warrior. But I'm a girl, too.

243
00:21:10,663 --> 00:21:14,962
Now get out of here! We'll hold them off.

244
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:20,227
Appa, yip yip!

245
00:21:21,693 --> 00:21:26,034
Back to the ship! Don't lose sight of them!

246
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,925
I know it's hard, but you did the right thing.

247
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:33,796
Zuko would have destroyed the whole place if we had stayed.

248
00:21:33,797 --> 00:21:36,763
They're going to be okay, Aang.

249
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:40,635
What are you doing?!

250
00:22:17,024 --> 00:22:20,150
Thank you, Avatar.

251
00:22:20,151 --> 00:22:23,827
I know, I know. That was stupid and dangerous.

252
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:26,990
Yes, it was.

253
00:22:29,995 --> 00:22:32,583
