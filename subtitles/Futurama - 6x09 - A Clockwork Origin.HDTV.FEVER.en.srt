00:00:19,922 --> 00:00:22,423
Item one: duck!

3
00:00:24,626 --> 00:00:26,327
Cubert, you crapscallion!

4
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:27,795
Why aren't you in school?

5
00:00:27,863 --> 00:00:30,231
I couldn't get past
the protestors.

6
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:31,699
A bunch of smiling,
angry people

7
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:33,835
were handing out these
anti-evolution flyers.

8
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:36,471
Evolution is under attack

9
00:00:36,538 --> 00:00:37,839
in our schools?!

10
00:00:37,906 --> 00:00:39,373
To the Science Mobile.

11
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:40,942
You mean the ship?

12
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:43,511
Yes.
The Science Mobile.

13
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:47,315
It's just that you've never
called it that before, but okay.

14
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:58,526
I don't understand evolution,

15
00:00:58,594 --> 00:01:01,429
and I have to protect my kids
from understanding it!

16
00:01:01,497 --> 00:01:03,831
We will not give in
to the thinkers!

17
00:01:07,636 --> 00:01:10,738
You people are as loud
as you are ignorant.

18
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:13,574
Now get back on your turnip
trucks and go home!

19
00:01:15,844 --> 00:01:19,514
That is an insultingly accurate
stereotype, sir!

20
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:21,816
As a Professor of science,
I assure you

21
00:01:21,884 --> 00:01:25,319
that we did, in fact,
evolve from filthy monkey-men!

22
00:01:25,387 --> 00:01:27,221
I cannot speak for you, sir,

23
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:29,323
but my ancestors
were not monkeys.

24
00:01:29,391 --> 00:01:30,958
They were orangutans.

25
00:01:31,026 --> 00:01:33,628
Hard-working,
patriotic orangutans.

26
00:01:33,695 --> 00:01:35,096
Dr. Banjo?

27
00:01:35,164 --> 00:01:36,564
In the fur.

28
00:01:36,632 --> 00:01:38,933
And I remind you that evolution
is merely a theory,

29
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:41,235
like gravity,
or the shape of the Earth.

30
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:46,707
Hey, Professor,
I'm a flying spaghetti monster.

31
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:48,609
You seriously believe
I'm descended

32
00:01:48,677 --> 00:01:51,279
from some kind
of flightless manicotti?

33
00:01:51,346 --> 00:01:53,214
Yes!
Oh, please.

34
00:01:53,282 --> 00:01:54,916
A far more logical explanation

35
00:01:54,983 --> 00:01:57,852
is the undisprovable science
of Creatureism.

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,154
All life was created
in its present form

37
00:02:00,222 --> 00:02:01,756
7,000 years ago

38
00:02:01,824 --> 00:02:04,625
by a fantastical creature
from outer space!

39
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:06,460
Bunk!
Oh?

40
00:02:06,528 --> 00:02:09,831
If your elitist
East Coast evolution is real,

41
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:12,300
why has no one found
the missing link

42
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:14,402
between modern humans
and ancient apes?

43
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,170
We did find it.

44
00:02:16,238 --> 00:02:17,972
It's called Homo erectus.

45
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,740
Then you have proven
my case, sir,

46
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:21,742
for no one has found the link

47
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,511
between apes
and this Homo erectus.

48
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:25,246
Yes, they have!

49
00:02:25,314 --> 00:02:26,848
It's called Homo habilis.

50
00:02:26,915 --> 00:02:29,550
Aha! But no one has found
the missing link

51
00:02:29,618 --> 00:02:32,486
between ape and this so-called
Homo habilis.

52
00:02:32,554 --> 00:02:34,288
Yes, they have!

53
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:36,757
It's called
Australopithecus africanus!

54
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:39,193
Oh-ho! I've got you now.

55
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:41,863
Fair enough,

56
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,731
but where then
is the missing link

57
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:46,000
between apes
and this Darwinius masillae?

58
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:48,302
<i>Answer me that, Professor!</i>

59
00:02:49,905 --> 00:02:53,074
Okay, granted, that one
missing link is still missing,

60
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:54,842
but just because
we haven't found it

61
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,544
doesn't mean it doesn't exist!

62
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,082
Things don't exist simply
because you believe in them.

63
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:04,118
Thus sayeth the Almighty
Creature in the Sky!

64
00:03:11,793 --> 00:03:14,662
I'll show that
banana-swilling poop-slinger!

65
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,932
We just need
to find that last missing link.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,500
<i>I found a
missing link.</i>

67
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:21,636
It seems to be half
man, half toucan.

68
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:22,904
Not what we're looking for.

69
00:03:22,971 --> 00:03:24,171
Throw it in the soup!

70
00:03:27,776 --> 00:03:29,343
And here's something.

71
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:31,545
Uh-oh. It's another one
of Fry's dogs.

72
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:32,813
You find something, Hermes?

73
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:34,248
Uh... no.

74
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:41,422
Ugh! I hate chiseling
right after a manicure.

75
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,124
Oh, darn it!

76
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:45,026
I broke off
one of my of fingers!

77
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:46,527
Look, Cubert.

78
00:03:46,595 --> 00:03:47,929
The neck on this one.

79
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:50,431
I bet he spent
a fortune on ties!

80
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:53,534
What, too soon?

81
00:03:53,602 --> 00:03:55,503
I highly doubt

82
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,339
a Jurassic elaphrosaurid
had access to neckwear.

83
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,877
I knew I should have gone with
the ring-around-the-collar joke.

84
00:04:02,945 --> 00:04:04,712
Hey, look!
I found a robot fossil!

85
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,649
That's a bedspring,
you dumb bedspring!

86
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:10,718
There are no robot fossils.

87
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:13,254
What?!
Who says I didn't evolve?

88
00:04:13,322 --> 00:04:14,689
Everybody!

89
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:16,791
Robots were created
quite recently.

90
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,592
It was in all the papers.

91
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,928
Then explain this!

92
00:04:28,737 --> 00:04:31,439
I've hit a rich
vein of missing links.

93
00:04:31,506 --> 00:04:35,242
Java Man, Piltdown Man,
Manfred Mann.

94
00:04:36,845 --> 00:04:38,446
Eureka!

95
00:04:38,513 --> 00:04:40,815
It's the elusive
missing missing link.

96
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:43,651
This will show Banjo
once and for all.

97
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:47,421
What the...?

98
00:04:47,489 --> 00:04:49,523
Oh, that's mine.

99
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:57,398
Hmm! My tux doesn't fit.

100
00:04:57,466 --> 00:05:00,468
Probably because I've grown
so much since I last wore it.

101
00:05:00,535 --> 00:05:02,703
Or evolved, one might say.

102
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:04,572
<i>One might not say that.</i>

103
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,308
Your tux doesn't fit because
you stole it from a boy.

104
00:05:07,376 --> 00:05:08,843
You mean a man.

105
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,578
It was his Bar Mitzvah.

106
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:12,847
Welcome, museum members.

107
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:15,750
Or as I like to call you,
future exhibits.

108
00:05:17,753 --> 00:05:19,720
He's good.

109
00:05:19,788 --> 00:05:22,456
Tonight, we have a new resident
here in the e e Hall of Homini,

110
00:05:22,524 --> 00:05:24,291
generously donated
by its discoverer,

111
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:25,893
Hubert Farnsworth.

112
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:28,662
Ladies and gentlemen...
Homo Farnsworth!

113
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:34,735
Once again,
science saves the day.

114
00:05:34,803 --> 00:05:36,871
The end.

115
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:38,906
And now, to discuss
the scientific implications

116
00:05:38,974 --> 00:05:43,611
of this discovery, our new
museum curator, Dr. Banjo!

117
00:05:47,582 --> 00:05:50,351
Thank you, Professor Farnsworth,
for your generous gift,

118
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:53,754
which has once
and for all disproven evolution.

119
00:05:53,822 --> 00:05:56,824
Behold! Homo Farnsworth

120
00:05:56,892 --> 00:06:00,428
frolicking with dinosaurs
at the moment of creation.

121
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:04,532
I don't want to live
on this planet anymore.

122
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:13,074
Faster! Faster!

123
00:06:13,141 --> 00:06:15,609
Just drop me off
at that asteroid over there.

124
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,549
Wow, this planetoid is
completely lifeless.

125
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:23,617
Not lifeless enough!

126
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:25,786
Set up my shack
so I can kick you out of it!

127
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:31,358
Professor, is this
your only water source?

128
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:32,893
It looks like
Diet Dr. Pepper.

129
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:34,528
It's not that bad.

130
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:36,697
It's just laden
with toxic minerals.

131
00:06:36,765 --> 00:06:38,799
But not for long.

132
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:40,534
What's in the tube?

133
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:44,505
Microscopic nanobots.

134
00:06:44,573 --> 00:06:48,742
They're tiny robots I designed
to eat up nasty irritants.

135
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,578
Speaking of nasty irritants,

136
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:52,279
what's gonna become of Cubert?

137
00:06:52,347 --> 00:06:54,048
Who? Oh, my son.

138
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:55,883
Don't worry.

139
00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:58,786
He's been safely abandoned
with his godfather.

140
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:02,623
Cubert, I felt we needed
some father-son bonding time,

141
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:04,859
so I found a couple
of baseball gloves

142
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:06,627
and boiled them up for lunch.

143
00:07:06,695 --> 00:07:08,696
Why don't you just go to hell?!

144
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:12,566
Wait! We still have
to discuss the facts of life.

145
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:14,335
What are they?!

146
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:19,373
Okay, I finished moving
the last grand piano.

147
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:20,875
Now can we have our pizza?

148
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:23,644
You'll get your damn pizza,
you parasite.

149
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:27,348
First let's see if my nanobots
have purified the water yet.

150
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:35,322
Ah, the water's as sterile
as my milkman-trusting father.

151
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,991
But what's this?

152
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:39,627
The nanobots
have gotten more complex.

153
00:07:39,694 --> 00:07:41,495
What's that, you say?

154
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:44,398
Those robots evolved
all by themselves, you say?

155
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:45,799
It wasn't by themselves.

156
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:47,368
I put them there.

157
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:48,736
I'm a genius.

158
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:50,404
Get over it.

159
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:51,639
Hey, look.
Now they got bigger.

160
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:54,808
Good heavens. Trilobots.

161
00:08:01,716 --> 00:08:04,752
Oh, no! My sunglasses
were in there!

162
00:08:14,688 --> 00:08:16,255
Let's get the pizza
out of here!

163
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:26,632
Look, there's a cave-like hole
in that mountain.

164
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,334
It might be a cave.

165
00:08:36,076 --> 00:08:37,610
Does anyone
have a lighter?

166
00:08:37,678 --> 00:08:39,445
Hang on.

167
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,752
Okay, we have shelter

168
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,087
and just enough precious food

169
00:08:48,155 --> 00:08:49,555
to ward off starvation.

170
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:51,257
It's pizza time!

171
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:55,094
Pineapple?!

172
00:08:55,162 --> 00:08:56,595
Ugh!
Oh, man!

173
00:08:56,663 --> 00:08:57,830
Oh!
So much
for that.

174
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:00,866
Hello.

175
00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:02,802
I remembered
you liked superheroes,

176
00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:05,271
so I painted you a mural
on your wall.

177
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,373
This is Father-Man.

178
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:09,542
He fights crime to
earn Son-Boy's respect.

179
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:10,843
Is it working?

180
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,378
This is sucky!

181
00:09:12,446 --> 00:09:13,846
You suck!

182
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:15,648
Who taught you
to do three-point perspective?

183
00:09:15,716 --> 00:09:17,850
I could make a better mural
with my butt!

184
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:22,521
Father-Man away.

185
00:09:29,496 --> 00:09:31,931
Nothing like a cave for
a good night's sleep.

186
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:35,401
So what do we got to eat that's
not poisoned with pineapple?

187
00:09:35,469 --> 00:09:37,903
I packed plenty
of food, but it's all in

188
00:09:37,971 --> 00:09:40,439
dehydrated pill form.

189
00:09:40,507 --> 00:09:42,008
Then we need water
from that pond.

190
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:44,010
We'll have to fight our
way past the trilobots.

191
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:47,079
Go! Go!

192
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:48,614
Hit anything that moves!

193
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,058
A whole forest
grew overnight.

194
00:10:00,694 --> 00:10:02,094
All these trees are robotic.

195
00:10:02,162 --> 00:10:04,363
I can't believe
how quickly they sprung up.

196
00:10:04,431 --> 00:10:05,931
I can.

197
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:09,001
Robots do everything faster,
including evolving

198
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:11,303
and believing
how quickly things spring up.

199
00:10:16,643 --> 00:10:18,878
One thing about
Bristol-Myers-Squibb...

200
00:10:18,945 --> 00:10:21,113
they know how to cook a steak.

201
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:22,548
Hey, look at me.

202
00:10:22,616 --> 00:10:24,083
I'm the Tidy Bowl Man.

203
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:26,519
I own a yacht,
and everybody poops on me!

204
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:32,691
Help! Police!

205
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,493
Everybody grab a club.

206
00:10:43,103 --> 00:10:44,637
big, tough water guy,
why don't you come

207
00:10:44,704 --> 00:10:45,704
up here on land and...?

208
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:51,744
Look out for the next thing!

209
00:10:57,517 --> 00:10:59,652
Great Scott,

210
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,587
a tricycle-tops.

211
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:09,462
Throw down,
dinosaurs of the land and sea.

212
00:11:12,132 --> 00:11:16,969
This is a cool way to die...!

213
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:19,472
Dr. Zoidberg?

214
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:21,941
I'm sorry for treating you
like a total Zoidberg...

215
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:23,609
I mean, loser.

216
00:11:23,677 --> 00:11:26,112
Go on.

217
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:28,714
It's just that
I get bullied a lot.

218
00:11:28,782 --> 00:11:31,417
I guess I kind of make fun of
people as a defense mechanism.

219
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:32,651
Hey, Cubert,

220
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:35,421
is that your family mansion?

221
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,057
Why don't you ask your mom?

222
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,925
She's coming over
for a sex visit.

223
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:48,634
Don't worry, I know
how to handle bullies.

224
00:11:48,702 --> 00:11:50,736
Just pretend
like you're pathetic.

225
00:11:50,804 --> 00:11:51,971
Help, I'm scared!

226
00:11:52,038 --> 00:11:53,706
I wet myself.

227
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:55,608
I'm crying like a baby
and I'm soaking in pee,

228
00:11:55,675 --> 00:11:56,809
but what else is new?

229
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,781
The pee babies peed themselves.

230
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:05,651
I'm off to pottery class,
dorkwads.

231
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,621
And that's that.

232
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:12,791
Whoa! You're like some
kind of Dumpster Jedi.

233
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:15,728
So... you want
to come in maybe?

234
00:12:15,795 --> 00:12:18,964
I've got a nice pound cake
with a footprint on it.

235
00:12:23,503 --> 00:12:24,837
Aah, don't eat my butt!

236
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,542
If this is anything
like killing that pigeon

237
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:32,511
on my balcony, we've got
our work cut out for us.

238
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,025
Look out, a solar flare!

239
00:12:57,938 --> 00:12:59,338
What the shmell happened?

240
00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:01,273
A mass extinction.

241
00:13:01,341 --> 00:13:04,777
That solar flare created
a huge electromagnetic pulse

242
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:07,379
that, while harmless
to organic life,

243
00:13:07,447 --> 00:13:09,348
short-circuited
the robo-dinosaurs.

244
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,050
Convenient.

245
00:13:11,117 --> 00:13:14,920
Only puny mammal-like robots
cowering in caves could survive

246
00:13:14,988 --> 00:13:17,756
such a catastrophe.

247
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:20,292
Guys, guys!
I taught myself to knit.

248
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,994
Wait a moment.

249
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:25,764
If we could scavenge the right
parts from these robo-dinos,

250
00:13:25,832 --> 00:13:28,701
I might be able to construct
a rudimentary spaceship

251
00:13:28,768 --> 00:13:30,836
to get us off this planet.

252
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:37,643
Well, it took almost two
hours, but it's finished.

253
00:13:39,846 --> 00:13:41,847
Now let's go... to sleep.

254
00:13:41,915 --> 00:13:45,784
It's solar powered, so we can't
take off until sunrise.

255
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:51,357
Well, let's find something comfy
to bed down on.

256
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:22,206
Hey, looky here.

257
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:30,181
Sweet robot swan
of Botswana.

258
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:31,449
Looks like the fittest did

259
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:33,885
a little surviving
last night, huh?

260
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:35,086
Whatever.

261
00:14:35,154 --> 00:14:36,387
Hey, looky there.

262
00:14:38,524 --> 00:14:40,558
Those robo-cavemen

263
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:42,059
have kidnapped our
human regular-women.

264
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:43,761
We gotta save 'em.

265
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:46,330
But the only weapon
we have is my fan dance.

266
00:14:46,398 --> 00:14:49,333
Hmm. I believe I can
fashion a slingshot

267
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:54,038
using this robot wishbone
and this elastic from my pants.

268
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:03,948
I think they want wives,

269
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:06,017
so just play along.

270
00:15:06,084 --> 00:15:08,319
If it doesn't work out, we'll
still get half their rocks.

271
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:10,021
I can earn my own rocks.

272
00:15:10,088 --> 00:15:12,757
Also, I don't want any rocks.

273
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:17,428
Well, it took almost 12 hours,
but it's finished.

274
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:19,997
It's too dark now,

275
00:15:20,065 --> 00:15:22,066
but first thing tomorrow,
we'll slingshot them

276
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:24,902
like they've never been
slangshat.

277
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:38,416
What's going on?

278
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:39,884
How did we save you?

279
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:41,152
It was the weirdest thing.

280
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,087
We went to sleep,
and when we woke up,

281
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:44,956
our cave husbands were gone.

282
00:15:45,023 --> 00:15:46,157
I'm going to miss Spencer.

283
00:15:51,463 --> 00:15:53,097
Don't be afraid, little guys.

284
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:54,899
I'm not going to hurt you.

285
00:15:57,903 --> 00:15:59,237
Nice net.

286
00:15:59,304 --> 00:16:01,205
What, you...
you can speak?

287
00:16:01,273 --> 00:16:02,840
Dread my locks.

288
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:04,709
A fully-evolved
robot human.

289
00:16:04,776 --> 00:16:07,144
I'm Dr. Widnar, a naturalist.

290
00:16:07,212 --> 00:16:09,146
And I'm Bender, baby.

291
00:16:09,214 --> 00:16:11,015
My human slaves and I come

292
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,050
from a planet
where organic life

293
00:16:13,118 --> 00:16:15,786
and robotic life
evolved side by side.

294
00:16:15,854 --> 00:16:17,255
Oh, shut up.

295
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:18,823
Amazing.

296
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:20,391
I've theorized
that carbon-based,

297
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,326
fat-filled life
could exist,

298
00:16:22,394 --> 00:16:24,962
but until today,
I never had any proof.

299
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,163
Good for you.

300
00:16:26,231 --> 00:16:28,666
Can we go home now?

301
00:16:43,315 --> 00:16:45,116
Welcome, museum members,

302
00:16:45,183 --> 00:16:48,719
or as I like to call you,
future exhibits.

303
00:16:50,155 --> 00:16:52,323
I now present
my latest discovery...

304
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:56,727
the amazing non-mechanical man,
Homo Farnsworth.

305
00:16:57,863 --> 00:16:59,830
Thank you.

306
00:16:59,898 --> 00:17:03,367
I must say, I'm so proud to
see what you've blossomed into

307
00:17:03,435 --> 00:17:06,003
since I first created
your ancestors.

308
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:09,173
What?!
I thought you knew.

309
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:10,841
You all evolved

310
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:13,811
from some filth-gobbling
nanobots I designed.

311
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:16,948
I dumped them in one of
your ponds a few days ago.

312
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:19,884
But, but this is
creationist talk.

313
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:21,352
He speaks lies.

314
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,188
The Earth was created
in eons, not days.

315
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:27,892
Yes, relative to you,
it was eons, but, well,

316
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,928
look at this hologram I took
the day before yesterday

317
00:17:30,996 --> 00:17:34,165
of a robot frolicking
with a robo-dinosaur.

318
00:17:34,232 --> 00:17:36,400
Hogwash.

319
00:17:36,468 --> 00:17:38,803
I don't want to live
on this planet anymore.

320
00:17:42,207 --> 00:17:44,942
You're under arrest for
crimes against science.

321
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,278
No...!

322
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:49,714
Could you drag me
by the restroom?

323
00:17:57,222 --> 00:17:59,623
Go back to Roboklahoma!

324
00:17:59,691 --> 00:18:01,192
Order!

325
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:03,828
<i>In the matter
of Everyone v. Farnsworth,</i>

326
00:18:03,895 --> 00:18:07,198
the alleged creationist faces
a sentence of death by melting.

327
00:18:07,265 --> 00:18:09,867
Who is representing the accused?

328
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:11,836
I am. Ow!
I am, Your Honor.

329
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:15,039
Bender, what the
hell are you doing?

330
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:17,174
Shut up, I'm billing you
by the hour.

331
00:18:17,242 --> 00:18:20,011
Besides, I'm a robot;
They'll listen to me.

332
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,048
Ladytrons and gentlebots...

333
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:26,050
Objection.
In the absence of pants,

334
00:18:26,118 --> 00:18:28,786
defense's suspenders
serve no purpose.

335
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:31,288
I'm going to allow them...
for now.

336
00:18:31,356 --> 00:18:32,957
Thank you.
Your Honor,

337
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:35,359
this meat-man does not deny
that we robots are

338
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:37,928
the glorious product
of evolution.

339
00:18:37,996 --> 00:18:40,131
He claims only to have played
a small role

340
00:18:40,198 --> 00:18:42,199
in supplying
the initial machinery.

341
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:45,002
I ask you, is that so crazy?

342
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,204
Yes, it's completely crazy,

343
00:18:47,272 --> 00:18:48,906
and that is
why you must find him

344
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:51,375
not guilty
by reason of insanity!

345
00:18:52,944 --> 00:18:54,845
Objection.
I'm not crazy.

346
00:18:54,913 --> 00:18:56,781
I created you all,

347
00:18:56,848 --> 00:19:00,184
and I came here in a homemade
spaceship and lived in a cave.

348
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:02,820
If you don't believe
me, ask my uncle.

349
00:19:04,556 --> 00:19:06,323
Prosecutor,
your opening statement?

350
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:07,858
Yeah, honey,
I'll be home for dinner.

351
00:19:07,926 --> 00:19:09,393
The prosecution rests,
Your Honor.

352
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:11,162
Very well.

353
00:19:11,229 --> 00:19:14,198
We will reconvene
when the jury reaches a verdict.

354
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:23,340
Son, you in a whole
mess o' trouble.

355
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:37,455
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

356
00:19:37,522 --> 00:19:39,490
No, we have not,

357
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:43,160
for we have evolved to a
higher state of consciousness.

358
00:19:43,228 --> 00:19:47,531
In the grand scheme, all
physical beings are but yokels.

359
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,467
Now, settle your
petty squabbles

360
00:19:49,534 --> 00:19:51,669
and get the hell out.

361
00:19:53,238 --> 00:19:56,006
That'll be $1P, 000.

362
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:09,820
Well, digital
photographs don't lie.

363
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:11,455
I admit that what you witnessed

364
00:20:11,523 --> 00:20:13,691
may have been some
form of evolution.

365
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:16,660
I'm glad you agree,
Dr. Banjo.

366
00:20:16,728 --> 00:20:19,497
Evolution set in motion by
a wise and all-knowing creator...

367
00:20:19,564 --> 00:20:21,565
you.

368
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:24,935
Oh, well, I don't know
about all-knowing.

369
00:20:25,003 --> 00:20:27,738
And I admit it's possible,
however unlikely,

370
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:30,741
that some wise and all-knowing
alien monster

371
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:33,544
set evolution
in motion here on Earth.

372
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:36,247
Oh, oh! And the creator
could also be a robot.

373
00:20:36,314 --> 00:20:39,750
Then who built this
so-called "creator robot"?

374
00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:42,419
Some magical bearded robot
in the sky?

375
00:20:44,356 --> 00:20:45,723
<i>I guess that would be silly.</i>

376
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,124
Never mind.

377
00:20:47,192 --> 00:20:48,826
Then it's settled.

378
00:20:48,894 --> 00:20:52,663
Finally, a world in which
I'm happy to raise my son.

379
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:55,566
Good, 'cause I'm sick of him.

380
00:20:57,636 --> 00:21:00,104
<i>I'm serious.
He's a terrible person.</i>

381
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:00,705
