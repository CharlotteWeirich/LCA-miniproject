00:00:09,154 --> 00:00:10,572
Ba-bum.

[Claudia] <i>Previously on</i>
"The Dragon Prince"...

5
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:23,102
[Viren] A party of our best
will be dispatched immediately

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,458
to find the princes.

7
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:27,451
I will task my own children,
Soren and Claudia,

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,160
with leading the rescue expedition.

9
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:33,274
I bound myself to end Prince Ezran's life.

10
00:00:33,342 --> 00:00:35,859
And this binding will never come off
while he's alive.

11
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:39,186
It will just get tighter and tighter
until I lose my hand.

12
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:41,560
- Just take it!
- [groans]

13
00:00:41,887 --> 00:00:43,693
[Ezran] We have to do something!

14
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:45,217
[Callum] Ez, no!

15
00:00:46,407 --> 00:00:48,101
He's alive!

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,490
Oh, no.

17
00:00:59,568 --> 00:01:02,404
Something's wrong with the egg.

18
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,362

22
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:55,435
Ez, you should really try to sleep.

23
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:58,097
I'm... I'm...

24
00:01:58,613 --> 00:02:01,726
[sneezes] I'm fide.

25
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:05,021
You're not "fide," you need rest.

26
00:02:05,954 --> 00:02:09,192
[sniffles] What are you drawing?

27
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:10,750
Oh.

28
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,548
When you were down there, under the ice,
I was so scared.

29
00:02:14,823 --> 00:02:17,885
I thought I was going to lose you
like we lost her.

30
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:19,964
But somehow you made it.

31
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:22,038
And now I can't stop thinking...

32
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,791
maybe she was watching over us.

33
00:02:26,558 --> 00:02:30,254
If she knew what we were trying to do,
she'd be proud of us.

34
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:35,527
And she would yell at you to go
sit closer to the fire and bundle up!

35
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,221
[sniffles] I know.

36
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:42,182
[Rayla] She's beautiful.

37
00:02:42,323 --> 00:02:43,810
She's your mother?

38
00:02:44,784 --> 00:02:46,269
[Callum] Yeah.

39
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:49,649
Um, I found some moonberries.

40
00:02:50,582 --> 00:02:53,694
This should keep us full... for a day.

41
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:56,834
And I found these for you.

42
00:02:56,921 --> 00:02:58,169
Bogeyberries!

43
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:01,494
Ancient Xadian cure
for the common sniffles.

44
00:03:01,926 --> 00:03:03,424
Mmm... nope.

45
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:06,040
They don't go in your mouth.

46
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:07,554
Uh...

47
00:03:07,641 --> 00:03:12,063
To cure a stuffy nose,
you've got to stuff 'em up your nose.

48
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,257
[Ezran] Oh. Seems doable.

49
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:16,592
How's the egg doing?

50
00:03:17,037 --> 00:03:18,737
[Callum] I don't think
it's getting better.

51
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:23,491
It was glowing so bright before,
but now it's dim and flickery.

52
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,227
It's even darker than when I left.

53
00:03:26,534 --> 00:03:28,437
We gotta find help.

54
00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:32,733

00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:56,507
[Soren whistling]

56
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:59,927
These are the best tracking hounds
in Katolis.

57
00:04:00,193 --> 00:04:03,031
One sniff, and they can follow
someone's scent for miles.

58
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,322
[barking]

59
00:04:05,073 --> 00:04:06,785
The step-prince's training shirt.

60
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,407
- It's so dirty.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

61
00:04:09,494 --> 00:04:11,957
He spends most of his training
falling in the mud.

62
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,751
More like the "mis-step" prince!
[laughing]

63
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,209
Uh...

64
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:20,627
You know, 'cause he trips and falls a lot?

65
00:04:20,714 --> 00:04:23,326
- [dog whimpers]
- Oh, no, the joke was clear.

66
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:24,718
[sniffing]

67
00:04:26,428 --> 00:04:28,456
- [barking]
- They found the trail!

68
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,335
- [horse whinnies]
- Yah!

69
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:40,218
[sighs] And... they lost the trail.

70
00:04:42,402 --> 00:04:44,013
[dog whimpers]

71
00:04:46,197 --> 00:04:48,684
Aw, good try, doggies.

72
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:57,985
[Rayla] There it is! A town!

73
00:05:01,004 --> 00:05:04,742
I knew I saw smoke.
Maybe we can find help.

74
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:08,216
Okay, sure.
We might find a dragon egg expert.

75
00:05:08,303 --> 00:05:11,349
But we will definitely find
a bunch of elf-hating humans.

76
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,376
[scoffs] No problem.

77
00:05:15,894 --> 00:05:19,840
Get ready to meet... human Rayla!

78
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:22,552
Yeah, I'm not sure that's gonna cut it.

79
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,773
Just wait.

80
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,069
Once I pair my disguise
with my perfect human impression,

81
00:05:28,156 --> 00:05:30,268
the illusion will be complete.

82
00:05:31,493 --> 00:05:34,855
[with accent] Greetings, fellow humans!
Human fellows!

83
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:37,709
I sure do like hanging out with
other humans,

84
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:41,612
and talking about things like money...
and starting wars.

85
00:05:41,836 --> 00:05:44,048
That's pretty good, actually.

86
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:48,160
Totally, my good human friend!
Bring it in.

87
00:05:48,343 --> 00:05:49,343
High four!

88
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:53,332
Uh... can you impersonate a fifth finger?

89
00:05:53,515 --> 00:05:54,809
Right, right.

90
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:58,754
I need some kind of a... hand disguise.

91
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:01,519
Look, snow-elf!

92
00:06:01,606 --> 00:06:04,677
I'm pretty sure that's a snow-man.

93
00:06:10,114 --> 00:06:12,184
Hand disguise!

94
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,357
Just don't shake hands with anyone.

95
00:06:22,627 --> 00:06:23,670
Snow-elf.

96
00:06:34,347 --> 00:06:37,769
[with accent] Just walking into town,
without a care in the world,

97
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,355
despite my sub-century life expectancy.

98
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,090
- Shh!
- That's the spirit!

99
00:06:45,483 --> 00:06:49,984
I defended the border against all manners
of horrors and monstrosities.

100
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:53,642
Things you can't even imagine.
There's nothing I fear now.

101
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:58,659
In fact, I wager I could defeat
any challenger here,

102
00:06:58,746 --> 00:07:00,875
with nothing but my dagger!

103
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,277
[crowd gasps]

104
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,800
What about you?

105
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,618
[clears throat]

106
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,662
[crowd applauds]

107
00:07:13,678 --> 00:07:16,832
Maybe... you!

108
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:22,421
- [crowd gasps]
- [big guy chuckling]

109
00:07:23,771 --> 00:07:26,771
This isn't even my biggest sword.

110
00:07:26,858 --> 00:07:28,731
Ooh! I'll take that bet!

111
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:32,348
- [man 1] My money on the big guy!
- [man 2] Mine, too!

112
00:07:36,451 --> 00:07:38,580
They're distracted. Let's go.

113
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,482
Wait, you'll want to see this.

114
00:07:45,752 --> 00:07:47,571
[crowd exclaims]

115
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:57,932
Well... I certainly hope
that wasn't your biggest sword.

116
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,584
[crowd laughing]

117
00:08:02,268 --> 00:08:04,296
[big guy sobbing]

118
00:08:04,854 --> 00:08:07,925
Ha! Anyone else?

119
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:09,605
What was that?

120
00:08:09,692 --> 00:08:11,566
It's a Sunforge blade!

121
00:08:11,653 --> 00:08:15,403
Wow! I can't believe
I just saw a real Sunforge blade!

122
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,910
What's a Sunforge blade?

123
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,949
In Xadia,
Sunfire elves can make magic weapons

124
00:08:20,036 --> 00:08:23,625
that stay as hot as the moment
they're forged for hundreds of years.

125
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:24,829
See that?

126
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:28,588
The sheath is inscribed with special runes
to protect him from the heat.

127
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,716
- Otherwise, well...
- His pants would be on fire?

128
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,827
Yeah. His legs, too.

129
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,094
Rayla, if that blade can cut through
a steel sword like it was butter...

130
00:08:40,181 --> 00:08:42,727
would you say it can cut through
pretty much anything?

131
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,648
Not just pretty much,
it can cut through anything.

132
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,508
[gasps] My wrist binding!

133
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:52,428
You have to go get that dagger.

134
00:08:54,445 --> 00:08:55,573
But what about the egg?

135
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,779
We'll find help for the egg.
Just meet back here at the statue.

136
00:08:58,866 --> 00:09:00,161
How will you get that dagger?

137
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,439
I'm going to ask nicely.

138
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,254
[Soren] What are we gonna do?

139
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:13,794
Can you just be quiet for a minute?
I'm trying to think.

140
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:15,630
Every minute we sit here,

141
00:09:15,717 --> 00:09:19,514
the step-prince and the crown runt
get further and further away.

142
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,802
[sighs] I know a tracking spell,

143
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:24,094
but first I need
something from the princes.

144
00:09:24,475 --> 00:09:25,520
We have this?

145
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:29,006
No, something more personal than a shirt.

146
00:09:29,314 --> 00:09:31,359
You mean like... underwear?

147
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,234
No, gross!

148
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:36,525
I mean like spit or toenails.

149
00:09:36,612 --> 00:09:41,072
We don't have time to search
the whole lodge for toenails, Claudia!

150
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:43,204
Well, I don't see you doing
anything helpful!

151
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,659
We have to do this!

152
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:47,370
If I fail, I don't know what Dad
will do to me!

153
00:09:47,457 --> 00:09:49,836
And I'm already failing at step one,
never mind...

154
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,363
"Never mind" what?

155
00:09:57,842 --> 00:10:00,496
You said,
"something like spit or toenails."

156
00:10:03,097 --> 00:10:05,209
What about elf hair?

157
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:08,349
Yes! That's perfect!

158
00:10:08,436 --> 00:10:10,315
We'll find Callum and Ezran

159
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:14,677
wherever we find that vile,
bloodthirsty elven assassin.

160
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:17,179
Cute braid, though!

161
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:25,872
Look! Do you think
this is some kind of animal doctor?

162
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,034
I think so.

163
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:30,150
Or... a dating service for pets?

164
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,290
Probably an animal doctor.

165
00:10:32,377 --> 00:10:33,671
But that's a good idea!

166
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,293
Right, Bait?

167
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,991
[sighs heavily]

168
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:42,650
[doctor] I'll be right with you!

169
00:10:46,808 --> 00:10:48,836
[whinnying]

170
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:55,149
[grunts]

171
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:57,398
Oh, I'm so sorry.

172
00:10:57,485 --> 00:11:00,615
There's nothing I can do
for that poor creature.

173
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,558
- Mmm.
- What?

174
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:05,323
Oh, no, no, no. He's fine.

175
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,064
- We have, uh, a different problem.
- [horse whinnies]

176
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:13,211
Oh, what happened to you, little sweetie?

177
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,416
- [whinnies]
- Aww!

178
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:17,965
You saw something really scary,
didn't you?

179
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,300
[doctor] She sure did.

180
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,173
This one ran away up the Cursed Caldera.

181
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,056
Whatever she saw,
she's lucky it only scared her.

182
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,833
Won't make that mistake again!

183
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:30,377
So... what can I help you with?

184
00:11:34,397 --> 00:11:36,091
[coins clinking]

185
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:50,745
[gasps]

186
00:11:56,627 --> 00:11:58,546
[panting]

187
00:12:08,222 --> 00:12:10,346
I won that money fair and square!

188
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:13,354
- I don't want your money.
- Then what do you want from me?

189
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,964
I want your help.

190
00:12:21,903 --> 00:12:23,764
[horse grunting]

191
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:27,309
Tell me exactly what's going on.

192
00:12:28,743 --> 00:12:31,117
[Callum] Well, uh...

193
00:12:31,204 --> 00:12:34,161
- A friend of ours has a problem.
- Jofus.

194
00:12:34,248 --> 00:12:36,276
Your friend's name is Jofus?

195
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,379
- It's a real name.
- Mmm-hmm. Yep.

196
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:42,253
Real name. Our friend, Jofus, has an egg.

197
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,757
[stammers] An animal egg.
He's been taking really good care of it.

198
00:12:46,844 --> 00:12:50,542
You know, keeping it warm, and safe...
wrapped in blankets.

199
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,198
Except one time he dropped it
into an icy lake for several minutes.

200
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:54,438
[clears throat] Anywho...

201
00:12:54,518 --> 00:12:55,897
Uh, sorry, what was that?

202
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,773
He dropped it into an icy lake.

203
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,886
Joseph. Uh, Jofus.
Jofus did. This was Jofus.

204
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:06,449
Right, of course. That sounds bad.

205
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:09,280
Yeah. We're worried it's hurt.

206
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:12,855
The egg is colder,
and it doesn't glow like it used to.

207
00:13:13,204 --> 00:13:15,733
Wait, a glowing egg?

208
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,917
Uh... yes?

209
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:22,256
Look, I can tell you have a real problem.

210
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:27,536
I want to help, but I won't be able to
unless you tell me what's really going on.

211
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,416
I promise you,
I'm not going to get you in trouble.

212
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:36,938
- You can't tell anyone.
- I won't, okay?

213
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,465
But you need to trust me.

214
00:13:40,648 --> 00:13:41,816
[sighs]

215
00:13:47,905 --> 00:13:49,031
[gasps]

216
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:53,961
[Rayla] Wait!

217
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:55,326
I don't want to fight you.

218
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:57,833
I just want to borrow your blade
to cut this.

219
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,414
Oh, you just want to "borrow" it.

220
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:03,214
- Do you know how valuable...
- Fine. You hold it.

221
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,157
Just cut this thing off me.

222
00:14:05,506 --> 00:14:06,884
But it'll burn you.

223
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,995
I don't care! Just do it, please.

224
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,690
[yelps]

225
00:14:27,695 --> 00:14:30,682
[gasps] You're one of them!

226
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:32,910
[with accent] Who, me?

227
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:37,034
I'm just a simple human girl,
who likes the human things,

228
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:39,709
like bread, and complaining all the time.

229
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,540
No! You're an elf!

230
00:14:42,627 --> 00:14:44,738
[normal voice] Fine. I'm an elf.

231
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:53,372
Calm down, this will only take a second.

232
00:15:00,436 --> 00:15:01,771
Ahh!

233
00:15:05,316 --> 00:15:10,222
No! Nothing can cut this stupid binding!
Ugh!

234
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:14,226
Just take the dagger!
Don't hurt me, please!

235
00:15:15,076 --> 00:15:16,991
I'm not going to hurt you.

236
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:19,815
And I'm not going to steal from you,
either.

237
00:15:29,423 --> 00:15:31,839
[Soren] So... what are we doing here?

238
00:15:31,926 --> 00:15:35,164
I just need one more thing
for the tracking spell.

239
00:15:35,346 --> 00:15:38,458
[Soren] Hmm. Special rocks? Magic twig?

240
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:46,091
Ah, here it is!

241
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:48,943
This way!

242
00:15:53,114 --> 00:15:55,267
You're kidding, right?

243
00:15:55,783 --> 00:16:00,206
[grunting] If only... I weren't...

244
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,191
so muscular.

245
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,405
That's a dragon egg, isn't it?

246
00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:13,094
I've never seen one before.
Only pictures in books.

247
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,370
I'll do what I can.

248
00:16:16,887 --> 00:16:17,888
Hmm.

249
00:16:20,307 --> 00:16:23,354
- I do hear a heartbeat.
- That's good, right?

250
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,839
It's faint, and slow.

251
00:16:28,065 --> 00:16:30,260
I'm afraid it's dying.

252
00:16:31,902 --> 00:16:34,865
I don't know what I can do to save it.
I'm so sorry.

253
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,827
No! There has to be something you can do!

254
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,187
Anything! Please...

255
00:16:41,912 --> 00:16:45,734
Come on, Ez, let's go.
We'll find another way.

256
00:16:50,004 --> 00:16:51,168
[doctor] Wait.

257
00:16:51,255 --> 00:16:55,881
I'm hesitant to tell you about this,
because it might be incredibly dangerous.

258
00:16:55,968 --> 00:16:58,889
There was a miracle
that happened a few years ago,

259
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:02,668
but it happened... on the Cursed Caldera.

260
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,004
There's someone you should meet.

261
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,941
I'm Ellis.
And this is my sweetie wolf, Ava!

262
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:15,364
- [Ava coos]
- [Ellis exclaims]

263
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:19,697
[Ellis chuckles] The doctor's right,
there was a miracle.

264
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:22,413
I still don't really understand
how it happened.

265
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,358
But I do know this...
without it, Ava would be dead.

266
00:17:29,543 --> 00:17:30,666
[howling]

267
00:17:30,753 --> 00:17:32,882
[Ellis] Two years ago,
I found her in the woods,

268
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,701
when she was just a little cub.

269
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:39,430
Somehow, she got herself caught
in a hunter's trap.

270
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:43,100
Her front paw was crushed
in the rusty metal jaws.

271
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,876
And she was scared.

272
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:47,146
But she still had fight in her!

273
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,922
[Ava whimpers]

274
00:17:49,897 --> 00:17:54,511
I know you're hurting.
It's okay! I want to help you!

275
00:17:54,998 --> 00:17:56,091
[yips]

276
00:17:56,232 --> 00:17:59,141
I got her free,
and took her back to the village.

277
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:03,520
But things got worse.

278
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:07,248
[whimpers]

279
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:13,155
[softly] Her leg is too badly hurt.
It'll have to be removed.

280
00:18:24,098 --> 00:18:25,766
[barking]

281
00:18:30,938 --> 00:18:33,484
[man] We have
too many mouths to feed already.

282
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:34,652
[Ellis] Please!

283
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:38,108
Just for a few weeks,
while she gets stronger!

284
00:18:38,195 --> 00:18:40,616
Then we can send her back to the forest.

285
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:44,603
The pack won't accept her like this.
They'll let her die.

286
00:18:46,704 --> 00:18:49,566
[sighs] Ellis...

287
00:18:49,957 --> 00:18:52,027
I know it's hard to accept,

288
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:55,197
but putting her down now
is an act of kindness.

289
00:18:55,421 --> 00:18:57,574
Otherwise, she'll only suffer.

290
00:18:57,673 --> 00:18:58,673
[barks]

291
00:19:00,217 --> 00:19:02,120
[sobbing] No!

292
00:19:05,306 --> 00:19:07,768
[Ellis] I took her
where no one would follow us.

293
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:11,004
Up the slope of the Cursed Caldera.

294
00:19:13,772 --> 00:19:16,009
It was like the legends said.

295
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:18,178
The higher we climbed...

296
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:22,307
the more terrifying creatures
lurked in the shadows.

297
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:25,310
But we kept going.

298
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:36,333
I won't ever leave you.

299
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,883
We're gonna make it through this!
[sniffles]

300
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,045
[crying]

301
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:42,786
[Ellis] I was trying to make
Ava feel better,

302
00:19:42,873 --> 00:19:46,748
but inside, I knew all was lost.

303
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:49,042
That's when it happened.

304
00:19:52,895 --> 00:19:55,715
[woman] Oh, what a beautiful creature!

305
00:19:56,607 --> 00:19:59,719
[voice breaking] No... she's hurt.

306
00:20:01,278 --> 00:20:03,348
[woman] She's perfect.

307
00:20:16,377 --> 00:20:18,253
[barking]

308
00:20:28,222 --> 00:20:30,750
[pants and barks]

309
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:33,974
We have to find this miracle healer.

310
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:35,940
If she can save a cub's missing paw...

311
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,566
Maybe she can save a dragon egg!

312
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,718
Wait, a what?

313
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,066
Uh, he said, maybe she can...

314
00:20:43,153 --> 00:20:44,776
shave a wagon leg!

315
00:20:44,863 --> 00:20:47,952
- But why would she... But...
- [Ezran] Sorry! Gotta go!

316
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,853
[Callum] Thank you so much!

317
00:20:59,086 --> 00:21:01,490
[Soren] This is why I hate magic.

318
00:21:01,588 --> 00:21:03,759
It always involves something
really creepy.

319
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:06,661
- [fungus squishing]
- Ugh! Gross!

320
00:21:17,938 --> 00:21:19,353
Oh, where is it?

321
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,760
[gasps] Wait! I know how to find it.

322
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:25,906
[Soren] What are you doing?
I can't see a thing!

323
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,535
- [Claudia] Shh!
- Oh, can you see better if I'm quiet?

324
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:34,022
[Claudia] Give it a moment.
Let your eyes adjust.

325
00:21:39,752 --> 00:21:42,155
[Claudia] Look! There!

326
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:48,578
[Soren grunts]

327
00:21:56,018 --> 00:21:59,130
Still think magic is creepy and gross?

328
00:22:08,322 --> 00:22:11,201
All right, so what else
do we need for this spell?

329
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,370
[chuckles] Nothing! We're all set.

330
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,908
Really? Great!

331
00:22:14,995 --> 00:22:19,109
All we have to do now is climb to the top
of the tallest mountain in Katolis.

332
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,820
It's a fun spell.

333
00:22:25,506 --> 00:22:28,410
[Ezran] Did you find the knife guy?
Did you get his knife?

334
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:33,498
The bad news is that
the Sunforge blade didn't work.

335
00:22:33,597 --> 00:22:37,168
The good news is that the binding
will fall off naturally...

336
00:22:37,434 --> 00:22:38,896
when my hand does.

337
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,482
[wincing] Ah, Rayla, I'm sorry.

338
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,106
It's fine.

339
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,569
Tell me something good happened
with the egg.

340
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:46,853
Yes and no.

341
00:22:46,921 --> 00:22:48,655
[stammers] Well... Well, no.

342
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,111
Not yet, but maybe!

343
00:22:51,198 --> 00:22:54,269
[chuckles nervously] So, yes? In a way?

344
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:58,064
Okay, that's averaging out
to be around a maybe-minus.

345
00:22:58,205 --> 00:22:59,583
Yeah, that's about right.

346
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,962
We learned about a miracle healer.
Someone who might be able to help the egg.

347
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,547
And maybe your hand, too!

348
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,877
Really?

349
00:23:06,964 --> 00:23:10,469
The only catch is,
the healer lives up there...

350
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,495
the Cursed Caldera.

351
00:23:13,554 --> 00:23:15,302
Please tell me it's named that

352
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:19,127
because it was discovered by
the great explorer, Sir Phineas Cursed.

353
00:23:19,217 --> 00:23:21,993
Well, actually, it's because it's infested
with horrible monsters...

354
00:23:22,061 --> 00:23:23,769
Yeah, no, I know.

355
00:23:23,856 --> 00:23:26,062
There she is! She's an elf!

356
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:27,189
[mob clamoring]

357
00:23:27,276 --> 00:23:29,971
Oh, right.
I forgot about the other bad news.

358
00:23:42,165 --> 00:23:43,651
[laughs menacingly]

359
00:23:54,928 --> 00:23:56,831
[mob clamoring]

360
00:23:57,931 --> 00:24:01,252
Forget it.
No point following them up there.

361
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,434
They'll never make it out alive.

362
00:24:04,607 --> 00:24:07,817
