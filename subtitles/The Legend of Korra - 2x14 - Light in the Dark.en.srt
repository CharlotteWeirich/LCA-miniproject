1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,250
Earth.

2
00:00:02,251 --> 00:00:04,250
Fire.

3
00:00:04,251 --> 00:00:05,250
Air.

4
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:08,250
Water.

5
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:12,250
Only the Avatar
can master all four elements

6
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:14,251
and bring balance to the world.

8
00:00:19,972 --> 00:00:23,250
After fusing with Vaatu,
Unalaq became a dark Avatar

9
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:25,250
and ripped Korra
and Raava apart.

10
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:26,250
By destroying Raava,

11
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:28,250
Unalaq and Vaatu transformed

12
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,250
into the most powerful
dark spirit that's ever lived.

13
00:00:30,251 --> 00:00:33,250
Tenzin managed to free Jinora
from the fog of lost souls,

14
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:36,250
but her spiritual quest
isn't over yet.

15
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:40,251
Can anyone save the world from
eternal darkness?

16
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,250
Ooh.

17
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:55,169
Pretty.

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,250
General Iroh,
are your ships in position?

19
00:00:57,251 --> 00:00:59,250
Yes, Mr. president,
but I need to know

20
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:01,251
what kind of enemy
we're dealing with.

21
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:15,251
It's time to take back
the physical world.

22
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:24,251
Fire!

23
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:50,251
Monster attack!

24
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:04,250
They're over here!

25
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:07,251
Please, wake up.

26
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:10,250
They're going to be all right,

27
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:14,251
but I need to get them into
some spirit water right away.

28
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:43,250
Thank goodness you're all okay.

29
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:44,250
Did you find Jinora?

30
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:46,250
I was able to rescue her soul,

31
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:49,250
but she wasn't ready
to return to her body yet.

32
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:52,250
She sense the world
was in grave danger.

33
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:55,250
She was right.

34
00:02:55,251 --> 00:02:57,250
Were you able
to stop Unalaq and Vaatu?

35
00:02:57,251 --> 00:03:02,250
No, they fused, then Vaatu
ripped Raava right out of me

36
00:03:02,251 --> 00:03:04,250
and destroyed her.

37
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,250
Vaatu won.

38
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,250
No!
I'm too young

39
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:10,250
to live through 10,000
years of darkness.

40
00:03:10,251 --> 00:03:12,250
Korra, can't you talk to one of
your past lives or something?

41
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:15,250
When Vaatu destroyed Raava,

42
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:19,250
he destroyed my connection
to the past Avatars too.

43
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:21,250
If that's true, then...

44
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:23,250
the cycle is over.

45
00:03:23,251 --> 00:03:26,250
I'm the last Avatar.

46
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:29,250
I'm so sorry, Tenzin.

47
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:39,251
She needs you now,
more than ever.

48
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:51,251
It's going to destroy
the entire city.

49
00:04:05,251 --> 00:04:09,251
We're going down.

50
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:45,250
It's pandemonium
in the streets.

51
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,250
Giant vines
are destroying everything.

52
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:50,250
This is Shiro Shinobi
signing off...

53
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:03,251
Zhu Li, commence operation
"winged freedom!"

54
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:11,251
Do the thing!

55
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:21,250
The other Avatars may not
be able to help you anymore,

56
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:22,250
but perhaps I can.

57
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:25,250
No one can help me now.

58
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:28,250
I know I haven't been
the best mentor to you,

59
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:30,250
but I realized it was because

60
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:33,250
I had a lot of spiritual growth
to do myself.

61
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:36,250
There may still be a way
for you to stop Vaatu.

62
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:37,250
How?

63
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:38,250
Let go of your attachment

64
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:40,250
to who you <i>think</i> you are,

65
00:05:40,251 --> 00:05:42,250
and connect
with your inner spirit.

66
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:44,250
Haven't you heard
anything I said?

67
00:05:44,251 --> 00:05:47,250
Raava is gone.

68
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:49,250
I'm not connected
to a spirit anymore.

69
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:51,250
I'm not talking about Raava.

70
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,250
Raava is not who you are.

71
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:55,250
Come with me.

72
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:58,251
I need to show you something.

73
00:06:00,251 --> 00:06:03,250
Why are you showing me
Vaatu's prison?

74
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:05,250
Because this tree had a history

75
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:07,250
long before it held Vaatu.

76
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:10,250
This is the tree of time.

77
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:12,250
And the legends
say that its roots

78
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:16,250
bind the spirit and physical
worlds together.

79
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:20,250
And you think this tree
can help me somehow?

80
00:06:20,251 --> 00:06:22,250
Yes, I have read that long ago,

81
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:25,250
the ancients would meditate
beneath this tree

82
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,251
and connect with the great
cosmic energy of the universe.

83
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:39,250
These are my memories.

84
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:42,250
The tree of time remembers all.

85
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:44,250
Korra, the most powerful thing
about you

86
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:48,250
is not the spirit of Raava,
but your own inner spirit.

87
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:52,250
You have always been strong,
unyielding, and fearless.

88
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:54,250
Avatar Wan.

89
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:59,250
Before he fused with Raava,
wan was just a regular person.

90
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:02,250
But he was brave and smart

91
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:04,250
and always wanted
to defend the helpless.

92
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:06,250
That's right.

93
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:08,250
He became a legend
because of who he was,

94
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:10,250
not what he was.

95
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:14,251
He wasn't defined by Raava
any more than you are.

96
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:22,250
Everyone in Republic City
is in danger.

97
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:25,250
- You have to help them, Korra.
- How?

98
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:26,250
They're halfway
around the world.

99
00:07:26,251 --> 00:07:29,250
Do as the ancients once did.

100
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:32,250
Connect to the cosmic energy
of the universe.

101
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:36,251
Don't bend the elements,
but the energy within yourself.

102
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:40,250
You really think I can do this?

103
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,251
I have no doubt.

104
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:46,250
Thank you
for not giving up on me.

105
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:49,251
I'm proud of you.

106
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:02,918
If you and Vaatu have the same
fight every 10,000 years,

107
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:05,250
why hasn't one of you
destroyed the other?

108
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,250
He cannot destroy light

109
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:09,250
any more
than I can destroy darkness.

110
00:08:09,251 --> 00:08:12,250
One cannot exist
without the other.

111
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:15,251
Find the light in the dark.

112
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:15,527
Uh... What did you say to her,
exactly?

113
00:09:47,864 --> 00:09:49,863
Korra's back.

114
00:09:49,864 --> 00:09:51,864
And she's a blue giant.

115
00:10:57,864 --> 00:11:01,863
You are looking
for something that is gone.

116
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:03,863
Raava has been destroyed.

117
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:07,864
And soon you will be too!

118
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:24,864
They're coming for Korra.

119
00:12:26,864 --> 00:12:28,863
Leave my Bolin alone!

120
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:31,863
I am so done with spirits.

121
00:12:31,864 --> 00:12:33,863
Eska!

122
00:12:33,864 --> 00:12:34,863
I love you!

123
00:12:34,864 --> 00:12:36,863
Mwah!

124
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:39,863
Let's face the end
of the world together!

125
00:12:39,864 --> 00:12:42,864
You're so romantic.

126
00:12:47,864 --> 00:12:49,863
With you out of the way,

127
00:12:49,864 --> 00:12:54,864
I will be the one true Avatar.

128
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:04,863
Mommy, it's Jinora.

129
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:06,863
She's... Beautiful.

130
00:13:06,864 --> 00:13:08,863
What?
Let me see.

131
00:13:10,864 --> 00:13:13,864
Be careful, sweetie!

132
00:13:33,864 --> 00:13:36,864
No!

133
00:13:37,864 --> 00:13:39,864
Raava.

134
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:40,863
Go in peace.

135
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:44,863
Harmonic convergence
is nearly over.

136
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:48,864
We must return to the spirit
world so we can fuse once again.

137
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:54,864
I'll see you soon, dad.

138
00:16:14,864 --> 00:16:17,864
Gran-gran, I missed you.

139
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:21,740
What about Korra
and the others?

140
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:22,863
Don't worry.

141
00:16:22,864 --> 00:16:23,863
They're all right.

142
00:16:23,864 --> 00:16:26,864
Korra saved the world.

143
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:23,864
Her Avatar spirit has returned.

144
00:17:36,864 --> 00:17:38,864
It's over.

145
00:17:48,897 --> 00:17:49,896
Mwah.

146
00:17:49,897 --> 00:17:52,439
I don't even know what to say.

147
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,896
You were amazing.

148
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:56,896
And the way you turned all
gigantic like that, wow!

149
00:17:56,897 --> 00:17:58,896
I just wish Varrick
had been here to film it.

150
00:17:58,897 --> 00:18:00,896
It would have been
the greatest mover ever.

151
00:18:00,897 --> 00:18:03,897
After <i>the Nuktuk chronicles,</i>
of course.

152
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:07,896
I'm sorry about your father,

153
00:18:07,897 --> 00:18:10,896
but he was already
fused with Vaatu.

154
00:18:10,897 --> 00:18:12,896
I couldn't save him.

155
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:14,896
It seems cousin Korra
is under the impression

156
00:18:14,897 --> 00:18:17,896
we are saddened
by our father's demise.

157
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,896
But I will not miss him at all.

158
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:22,896
In the end,
he became a deplorable man.

159
00:18:22,897 --> 00:18:24,896
Agreed.

160
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:26,896
But how will we
explain this to mother?

161
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,896
So I was thinking,
I'm not really a fan

162
00:18:28,897 --> 00:18:31,896
of the long-distance
relationship thing.

163
00:18:31,897 --> 00:18:34,815
So how about you move
to Republic City with me?

164
00:18:34,816 --> 00:18:36,896
I do not think
that will be possible.

165
00:18:36,897 --> 00:18:39,896
Okay, Desna can come too.

166
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:42,896
I will not be joining you,
Bolin.

167
00:18:42,897 --> 00:18:44,896
Desna and I must return home.

168
00:18:44,897 --> 00:18:47,896
- But you said...
- Eternal darkness was upon us.

169
00:18:47,897 --> 00:18:50,896
I became caught up
in the moment.

170
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,896
Yeah.

171
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:54,896
I guess I did too.

172
00:18:54,897 --> 00:18:57,896
But... You will always
hold a special place

173
00:18:57,897 --> 00:19:00,896
in the organ
that pumps my blood.

174
00:19:00,897 --> 00:19:04,896
I will remember you fondly,
my turtle-duck.

175
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,896
Bum-Ju, you're okay.

176
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:13,897
I missed you, little buddy.

177
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:21,896
Now that you're bonded
with Raava once again,

178
00:19:21,897 --> 00:19:25,147
are you also reconnected
to your past lives?

179
00:19:25,148 --> 00:19:27,896
No.

180
00:19:27,897 --> 00:19:29,896
I think that link
is gone forever.

181
00:19:29,897 --> 00:19:31,896
I see.

182
00:19:31,897 --> 00:19:35,897
Why don't you close the portals
and we'll go home.

183
00:19:42,897 --> 00:19:44,896
Maybe I shouldn't.

184
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:46,896
What do you mean?

185
00:19:46,897 --> 00:19:49,896
What if Unalaq was right

186
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,896
when he said the Avatar
shouldn't be a bridge

187
00:19:51,897 --> 00:19:53,896
between the two worlds?

188
00:19:53,897 --> 00:19:55,896
What if Avatar wan
made a mistake

189
00:19:55,897 --> 00:19:57,896
when he closed the portals?

190
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,896
What if humans and spirits

191
00:19:59,897 --> 00:20:03,896
weren't meant to live apart?

192
00:20:03,897 --> 00:20:06,896
Well, what do you think
I should do?

193
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:09,896
I think you should
trust your instincts.

194
00:20:09,897 --> 00:20:11,896
There is nothing else
I can teach you.

195
00:20:11,897 --> 00:20:14,896
You are the Avatar.

196
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:18,897
Whatever your decision,
I support you.

197
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,896
- Hey, can we talk?
- Of course.

198
00:20:35,897 --> 00:20:36,896
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you

199
00:20:36,897 --> 00:20:38,896
about that fight we had.

200
00:20:38,897 --> 00:20:40,896
I know I said
it wasn't that bad,

201
00:20:40,897 --> 00:20:43,896
but that's not exactly true.

202
00:20:43,897 --> 00:20:46,896
I, um... I broke up with you.

203
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:48,896
I remember.

204
00:20:48,897 --> 00:20:51,896
But I thought you said you
lost part of your memory?

205
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:53,896
I did, but being inside
the tree of time

206
00:20:53,897 --> 00:20:56,896
brought it back.

207
00:20:56,897 --> 00:20:58,896
I'm sorry
for blowing up at you.

208
00:20:58,897 --> 00:20:59,896
That's okay.

209
00:20:59,897 --> 00:21:01,896
I think we both said
some things that we regret.

210
00:21:01,897 --> 00:21:04,896
Why didn't you just tell me
the truth in the first place?

211
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:05,896
I know I should have,

212
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:08,896
but I didn't wanna hurt you
all over again.

213
00:21:08,897 --> 00:21:11,896
I guess part of me wanted to
forget about the breakup too.

214
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:14,896
I think we both know that
this...

215
00:21:14,897 --> 00:21:18,896
Us... Doesn't work.

216
00:21:18,897 --> 00:21:20,896
You're right.

217
00:21:20,897 --> 00:21:21,896
It's over.

218
00:21:21,897 --> 00:21:24,897
For real this time.

219
00:21:36,897 --> 00:21:37,896
I'll always love you, Korra.

220
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:40,897
And I'll always love you.

221
00:21:47,897 --> 00:21:51,896
You want a hug?

222
00:21:51,897 --> 00:21:54,896
Hmmm.

223
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:58,896
The war of the water tribes
is over.

224
00:21:58,897 --> 00:22:01,896
Unalaq has been defeated

225
00:22:01,897 --> 00:22:03,896
and the northern fleet
is returning home.

226
00:22:03,897 --> 00:22:06,896
The water tribes
will always be allies,

227
00:22:06,897 --> 00:22:09,896
but the Southern tribe
is now independent.

228
00:22:09,897 --> 00:22:11,896
And the Southern council

229
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,896
of elders has appointed
my father, Tonraq,

230
00:22:14,897 --> 00:22:20,896
to be your new chief.

231
00:22:20,897 --> 00:22:22,896
I've realized that even though
we should learn

232
00:22:22,897 --> 00:22:24,896
from those who came before us,

233
00:22:24,897 --> 00:22:28,896
we must also forge
our own path.

234
00:22:28,897 --> 00:22:32,896
So that is why I've decided
to keep the portals open.

235
00:22:32,897 --> 00:22:35,896
Humans can now physically
enter the spirit world

236
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:39,896
and spirits will
be free to roam our world.

237
00:22:39,897 --> 00:22:42,896
I will no longer be the bridge.

238
00:22:42,897 --> 00:22:46,896
Humans and spirits
must learn to live together.

239
00:22:46,897 --> 00:22:49,896
My mission will always
be to use Raava's light spirit

240
00:22:49,897 --> 00:22:53,896
to guide the world
toward peace and balance.

241
00:22:53,897 --> 00:22:56,896
Harmonic convergence has caused
a shift in the planet's energy.

242
00:22:56,897 --> 00:22:58,896
I can feel it.

243
00:22:58,897 --> 00:23:01,896
Things will never
be the same again.

244
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:06,896
We are entering a new age.
