1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,900
Earth

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:03,850
Fire

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,500
Air

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,300
Water

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Only the Avatar can master all four elements
...

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,200
And bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,825
Empire Earth
invaded the United Republic!

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,950
After Kuvira demonstrate the power of its spiritual weapon
,

9
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:27,775
President Raiko
gave the city

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,100
But the Avatar refused
to give up without a fight.

11
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,625
Korra did Baatar hostage Jr.,
waiting for Kuvira

12
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,700
Back off, but the plan failed
,

13
00:00:34,725 --> 00:00:36,975
Because shot the
under the Avatar team.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Does something or someone
may stop Kuvira

15
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:40,125
And its mecca giant?

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,900
BALANCE BOOK 4 CHAPTER 11
"COLOSSUS OF THE DAY"

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,750
Go ahead,
unhurried.

18
00:00:57,775 --> 00:00:59,475
I'm just hold
a monstrous thing.

19
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,550
For the love of Raava,
a lot of people here.

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,100
They all came out?

21
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,050
Kuvira is coming. With a squad
mecca-suits.

22
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:26,275
- What do you do?
- This is my hometown

23
00:01:26,276 --> 00:01:28,775
I hate to say, but there is no reason to take a chance the lives

24
00:01:28,776 --> 00:01:30,100
Fight it.

25
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,525
Let's leave the city now

26
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,400
We think of something
and returned.

27
00:01:33,425 --> 00:01:35,675
E
people that have not been evacuated?

28
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,650
If Kuvira
know that Wu is with them

29
00:01:37,675 --> 00:01:40,575
Can use that gun on him,
and kill everyone.

30
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,200
I have not been able to prevent
Kuvira taking Zaofu,

31
00:01:43,225 --> 00:01:45,525
I will not let her take
Republic City.

32
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,450
The world will not be safe
as she possess that weapon.

33
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,475
I agree.

34
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,700
Rid of that giant today.

35
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,450
- Lin!
- I'm glad you are well.

36
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:55,575
You bother me.

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,800
You, rulers,
will have to fight alone.

38
00:01:57,825 --> 00:02:00,975
It destroyed our factory
with all mecca-suits.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,200
Not all.

40
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,600
There are prototypes in my office.

41
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,725
If we make them fly, we will be able

42
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,550
To offer some air support.

43
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:12,575
Su takes Baatar and other
for the Asami office.

44
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Try to put these costumes to work
as soon as you can.

45
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,151
The rest, will face
the Kuvira to us.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,075
Please calm down everyone!

47
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,700
Trains shall return soon
to take you.

48
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:29,725
Tell that idiot mecca-
to calm down.

49
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,925
It is he who is destroying
the whole city!

50
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,700
I hate to be the bearer of more bad news
,

51
00:02:34,725 --> 00:02:37,500
I heard on the radio that the
Kuvira Army

52
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:39,225
Destroyed the tracks of the train.

53
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,600
We will not leave town
the train.

54
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,550
Staff, was in the tower observation

55
00:02:44,575 --> 00:02:47,425
And saw a group of soldiers
mecca-with costumes to come here!

56
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,150
How wonderful!
The giant is not enough?

57
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,250
Over!

58
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:53,025
Let's be transformed into dust!

59
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,100
Listen, folks.

60
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,475
I can get us out
to calm down.

61
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,200
You can come off the bench, please?
It is tight.

62
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:01,325
Course.
I'm just the driver.

63
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:03,300
No one needs me
on the bench.

64
00:03:03,301 --> 00:03:06,833
Stay calm.
I'll be back. Come on!

65
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:10,115
- Where are you going?
- I'll get help.

66
00:03:10,116 --> 00:03:13,066
Can you handle this crowd
unmanageable for some time?

67
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,730
I created the Meelo.
I can deal with anything.

68
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:25,512
One paint store?
That's it!

69
00:03:27,252 --> 00:03:28,886
What are you doing, Meelo?

70
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:31,379
I have an idea of how
stop the giant!

71
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,279
Now everyone gather up a can of paint
and arrange me some balloons!

72
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,750
Dominators air
approaching.

73
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:56,151
I can see them.

74
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:45,027
Spears bombs!

75
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:02,313
Clean the glass.

76
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:09,299
Now!

77
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,085
The joints also are
platinum.

78
00:05:15,086 --> 00:05:17,109
I could not bend it!

79
00:05:17,824 --> 00:05:21,400
You are about to warm
feet, metal girl!

80
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:42,034
Attack now!

81
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,599
Opal!

82
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:21,788
Everybody, withdraw.

83
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:24,000
Take the injured to the offices of Asami.

84
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:26,912
Meeting you there.
I will see if I can find help.

85
00:07:40,105 --> 00:07:42,618
Okay.
Let's try to turn it back on.

86
00:07:53,591 --> 00:07:55,200
I can not stabilize!

87
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:56,601
I thought that you had repaired

88
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,500
- Hydraulic system.
- And I fixed it!

89
00:07:58,501 --> 00:07:59,901
Twists harder!

90
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:08,664
I hope you something

91
00:08:08,665 --> 00:08:10,865
You can take down a squad
mecca-suits.

92
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,066
's Troops Kuvira
are coming in this direction!

93
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:15,077
I know how to end
with some mecca-suits,

94
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,035
And this may end well
with that giant!

95
00:08:18,036 --> 00:08:20,679
Asami, off
everything is electric here,

96
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,799
Until we get back.
Zhu Li, come on.

97
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:29,478
Where am I?

98
00:08:30,097 --> 00:08:32,485
- Mother?
- Just rest, son.

99
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:36,685
- I'm here.
- Mom, I'm sorry.

100
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:40,241
I betrayed you...
betrayed the whole family.

101
00:08:40,983 --> 00:08:43,031
I gave my life to Kuvira,

102
00:08:43,032 --> 00:08:45,532
And it just shot
that gun at me.

103
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:46,933
How could you?

104
00:08:47,183 --> 00:08:50,839
I do not know, honey.
It is a complicated person.

105
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,042
Wing and Wei will never forgive me.
And Opal...

106
00:08:55,043 --> 00:08:57,907
Yeah, maybe they take a while to accept it
,

107
00:08:57,908 --> 00:09:00,986
But we will solve this,
as a family.

108
00:09:04,312 --> 00:09:06,685
Do you really think this plan will work
, Lord?

109
00:09:06,686 --> 00:09:08,336
I know I can stop
the mecca-costumes

110
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:10,017
With a pulse electromagnetic
,

111
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:13,523
So it is logical that can
stop a giant Mecca-costume

112
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:16,210
With a giant electromagnetic pulse.

113
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,956
- Zhu Li, I was thinking.
- Is always, Lord.

114
00:09:22,957 --> 00:09:26,489
Yes, but lately,
I was thinking about you.

115
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:30,669
Maybe we not survive
to this, and I feel I must

116
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,020
- Tell you some things.
- "Some things"?

117
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:34,447
I remember when I was a kid,

118
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:38,830
I had a horse-ostrich,
and called her Mrs. Beaks.

119
00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:41,769
I grew up on a farm.
I have told you this, Zhu Li?

120
00:09:42,002 --> 00:09:45,506
That was before
Men Circus take me.

121
00:09:45,507 --> 00:09:50,348
Anyway, I loved Mrs. Beaks,
but did not give him value.

122
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:52,629
You'll need to finish
his story later.

123
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,397
The troops
of Kuvira are close.

124
00:09:55,369 --> 00:09:57,682
Okay.
I hope this works.

125
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,978
Good!
All are defeated.

126
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:14,301
Yikes!
It remains to come.

127
00:10:14,663 --> 00:10:16,206
Zhu Li, is the thing!

128
00:10:16,207 --> 00:10:18,798
I'm afraid there is nothing else to do
.

129
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:23,308
- What was that?
- An electromagnetic pulse.

130
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:26,159
Hung the mecca-costumes, but
not our source of energy.

131
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,851
Located the source of the wrist.
Must be where the Varrick is.

132
00:10:28,852 --> 00:10:32,250
3rd and 4th platoon,
follow and continue cleaning.

133
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:34,701
Track down anyone who ever left this city.

134
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:36,891
Varrick,
how your electric thing

135
00:10:36,892 --> 00:10:39,042
Hung up smaller outfits
but not great?

136
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:41,343
Because it uses energy
spiritual vines.

137
00:10:41,504 --> 00:10:42,904
I'm sorry.

138
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:45,842
I wish I could help you,
but that thing is unstoppable.

139
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:47,243
It's not.

140
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,100
Father?

141
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,334
Withdrew the chain
to help us.

142
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:55,719
I figured we were going to need
all geniuses we can.

143
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,870
If the prison still exists
after all this,

144
00:10:57,871 --> 00:11:01,108
- We put it back there.
- I know what you must think of me,

145
00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:03,119
But I love Republic City

146
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,197
And would do anything to save her.

147
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,066
You think you know
how to stop this thing?

148
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,140
Should act as if they were
an infection:

149
00:11:09,141 --> 00:11:11,491
Penetrate the skin and then
attacking vital organs.

150
00:11:11,492 --> 00:11:13,264
Turn off the heart and brain,

151
00:11:13,265 --> 00:11:14,993
And this beast will not survive.

152
00:11:14,994 --> 00:11:17,150
But how do we get?

153
00:11:17,151 --> 00:11:19,351
The Industries of the Future
have plasma saws

154
00:11:19,352 --> 00:11:22,351
To cut platinum.
With a saw in Mecca-costume...

155
00:11:22,352 --> 00:11:26,700
But the mountains are huge.
We will never bring you down.

156
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:28,808
Perhaps if we add an electric element

157
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:31,309
The welding torch
in fact, and convert it

158
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,700
A plasma saw.
So just cut the giant,

159
00:11:34,701 --> 00:11:37,501
And make a big hole
enough for someone to enter.

160
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:39,332
As a metal mosquito.

161
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,985
You know what happens
with mosquitoes that land on me?

162
00:11:41,986 --> 00:11:43,386
Crush them!

163
00:11:43,387 --> 00:11:44,787
We will have to tackle together

164
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,488
To try to keep them safe
in costumes hummingbird.

165
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:49,389
It seems
are our only hope.

166
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:53,904
First you eat fruit
and then eating leaves

167
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:57,895
The little hungry lemur
ate all my trees

168
00:11:57,896 --> 00:12:00,498
Okay.
Good job guys.

169
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:02,526
Who has another song
for us?

170
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:05,477
We can not stand here and sing songs
the air rulers

171
00:12:05,478 --> 00:12:08,023
Until being captured,
or worse.

172
00:12:08,024 --> 00:12:09,624
We must play the play button?

173
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,025
Who has a button?

174
00:12:19,603 --> 00:12:21,951
Where did these moles-badger
come from?

175
00:12:21,952 --> 00:12:25,937
From the zoo! The Mako always hated
my corner, but they love it!

176
00:12:26,197 --> 00:12:28,821
What do we do with these moles
-badger?

177
00:12:28,822 --> 00:12:30,652
It's the best
land domineering!

178
00:12:30,653 --> 00:12:32,803
You can make us a tunnel
out of town

179
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:34,654
Without troops Kuvira
see us.

180
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:36,626
Are you sure that this
is the best plan?

181
00:12:37,805 --> 00:12:39,305
Let's follow the moles!

182
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:43,429
Moles badger-digging holes in Republic City

183
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,400
We need to get away from Kuvira today

184
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:47,664
Although yet to find beautiful

185
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:52,600
Meca-platoons report.

186
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:55,533
3rd platoon. There is no sign
people so far.

187
00:12:55,534 --> 00:12:57,850
4th platoon.
On the way to the train station.

188
00:12:58,305 --> 00:13:01,300
I think we found the source of the electromagnetic pulse
.

189
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:03,151
Come tower
of Future Industries.

190
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,850
Is that the place.

191
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:10,176
The Kuvira is coming
in our direction.

192
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:13,425
How long will it take
to the mountains be ready?

193
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,826
Just a few minutes.

194
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,427
Go to the giant
as well as they can.

195
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,878
If you can get,
searching the engine room.

196
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,308
There are two emergency levers.

197
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:22,103
If the two  activate it
while

198
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:24,135
- You will be able to cut the power.
- Thanks.

199
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,086
We may not be able to stop it
,

200
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:28,350
But we can delay it.
Come on!

201
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,800
Jinora!

202
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,358
Yin...

203
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:22,964
Are the displaced of war
sweetest I know

204
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:25,982
I want to thank you for having
been so kind

205
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:29,066
While living under your roof

206
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:31,415
Stop.

207
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,794
Turn it slowly, and please
stop with the singing.

208
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:37,248
Are all prisoners
Earth Empire.

209
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:39,312
Come with us and no one will be hurt.

210
00:16:39,313 --> 00:16:40,713
You do not need these people.

211
00:16:40,714 --> 00:16:43,364
They are just innocent civilians caught in the crossfire
,

212
00:16:43,365 --> 00:16:44,962
But I'm the Prince Wu

213
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,230
Right by leading
Earth Kingdom.

214
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:48,631
Take me to Kuvira.

215
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,622
She and I have issues
solve.

216
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:53,347
- No! Do not do that, Wu!
- I need to do.

217
00:16:53,348 --> 00:16:57,405
But before you go,
I like to sing you a song.

218
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,100
If not respeitares
the ferret

219
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,325
Do not you respect me for me

220
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,400
No, no, no, no, no

221
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:10,225
There are
better than a giant cockroach?

222
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,775
But I'm royal

223
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,800
I have my moles-badger me

224
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,550
In fact,
your music is so bad,

225
00:17:18,575 --> 00:17:20,525
The moles-badger your
abandoned you.

226
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,300
Do not know

227
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:27,325
What are you saying

228
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,100
Moles-badger
I love them, love them

229
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:40,525
I want, I want...
Stroking your noses

230
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,450
If we stop that mecca giant,

231
00:17:52,475 --> 00:17:54,175
Will be because of you.

232
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,000
You do projectaste
these amazing costumes.

233
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,800
It's great to be working together again
.

234
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,850
I love you, Dad.

235
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,700
I love you.

236
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,250
- Zhu Li?
- Yes?

237
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,700
There's something I want to put
before descolarmos.

238
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,700
Put what?

239
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:22,025
I need to put this ring on your finger
.

240
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,700
Zhu Li Moon,
accepted to do the thing

241
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:27,475
For the rest of our lives?

242
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,300
I accept.

243
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,900
Good...!

244
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,450
Let's put these buckets
rust malfunctioning

245
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:42,475
Murdering a giant machine!

246
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,400
It's exactly as imagined
our engagement.

247
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,200
Ready to scratch
in the middle of the back,

248
00:19:22,225 --> 00:19:24,625
- In place ever reach!
- Got it.

249
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,000
Let's get out of here.

250
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,300
Wow!
I liked to have that flexibility.

251
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,550
Hang on!

252
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,500
I need more power!

253
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:52,925
They are cut to enter!
More energy!

254
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,000
- We have to leave.
- I'm almost.

255
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,100
- We have to leave now.
- Almost. Almost.

256
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,600
- Father! Now!
- Goodbye, Asami.

257
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,025
I love you.

258
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,300
Father!

259
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,250
