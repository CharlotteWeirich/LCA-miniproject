<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:13,496
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:17,575
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:21,888
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:25,048
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:29,210
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:31,050
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:36,989
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,612
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:50,529
Book One: Water | Chapter Nineteen:
The Siege of the North Part 1

15
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,871
Nice try, Pupil Sangok.

16
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:20,100
A couple of more years and you might be ready to fight a sea sponge.

17
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:26,758
Would anyone care for a rematch with Katara?

18
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,330
Katara, you have advanced more quickly than any student I have ever trained.

19
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:35,050
You have proven that with fierce determination,...

20
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:39,516
...passion and hard work you can accomplish anything.

21
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:42,412
Raw talent alone is not enough.

22
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:43,323
Pupil Aang!

23
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,625
Yes, Master Pakku?

24
00:01:44,683 --> 00:01:47,571
Care to step into the sparring circle?

25
00:01:47,644 --> 00:01:50,379
I figure since you've found time to play with house pets...

26
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:53,202
...you must have already mastered waterbending.

27
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:57,604
I wouldn't say "mastered", but check this out!

28
00:02:06,556 --> 00:02:09,074
So they don't have palaces in the Southern Tribe?

29
00:02:09,138 --> 00:02:15,744
Are you kidding? I grew up in a block of ice. It's not exactly a cultural hub.

30
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,267
Sokka, this is wrong.

31
00:02:19,327 --> 00:02:21,699
What's wrong? We're taking a walk!

32
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:25,968
I'm engaged. It just... feels...

33
00:02:26,014 --> 00:02:29,133
I know what you need! You need to meet my good friend Appa!

34
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,094
Who?

35
00:02:31,113 --> 00:02:34,045
Appa and I go way back. Don't we boy?

36
00:02:34,106 --> 00:02:35,894
Ahh! Easy!

37
00:02:35,954 --> 00:02:38,255
Down boy! Ahh! No! Up!

38
00:02:38,313 --> 00:02:42,213
Looks like you haven't been giving Appa enough attention.

39
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,495
So how does this work?

40
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,887
You hangin' on tight?

41
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:48,004
Mmm hmm.

42
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:50,876
Yip... yip!

43
00:02:50,926 --> 00:02:53,896
Oh... my... goodness!

44
00:02:55,414 --> 00:02:59,179
Wow! I can't believe you do this every day!

45
00:02:59,223 --> 00:03:01,370
Yeh, we pretty much live up here.

46
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,670
Is it always this cold in the sky?

47
00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:08,207
Not when you're with someone.

48
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,989
It's beautiful up here.

49
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:11,650
Yeh.

50
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:21,808
Whoo! Yeh! Huh... Good times! Good times!

51
00:03:21,863 --> 00:03:23,883
Hey, look!

52
00:03:23,914 --> 00:03:26,095
What's happening?

53
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:28,498
Oh no.

54
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:52,624
Soot.

55
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:53,039
What?

56
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:58,894
I've seen it before. Right before my village was attacked. It's soot mixed with snow.

57
00:03:58,952 --> 00:03:59,758
But why?

58
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:03,442
It's the Fire Nation. They've closed in on the North Pole.

59
00:04:03,475 --> 00:04:05,305
And from the looks of the stuff...

60
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:08,016
...I'd say there's a lot of them.

61
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:14,710
This will truly be one for the history books, General Iroh.

62
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:19,533
Just think, centuries from now, people will study the great Admiral Zhao...

63
00:04:19,577 --> 00:04:23,251
...who destroyed the last of the Water Tribe civilization.

64
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,229
You're lucky you're here to see it.

65
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:31,794
Be careful what you wish for, Admiral. History is not always kind to its subjects.

66
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:34,645
I suppose you speak from experience?

67
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:40,686
But rest assured, this will be nothing like your legendary failure at Ba Sing Se.

68
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:43,311
I hope not, for your sake.

69
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,653
Tell the Captains to prepare for first strike.

70
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,617
We'll be landing soon. Do you have a plan?

71
00:04:57,653 --> 00:05:00,590
I'm working on it, Uncle.

72
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:12,167
What's wrong? We have to go!

73
00:05:12,193 --> 00:05:16,241
No, Sokka, wait. I can't see you anymore. Not at all.

74
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,855
What? We're just friends.

75
00:05:18,904 --> 00:05:20,788
I wish we could just be friends,...

76
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,798
...but I like you too much and it's too confusing to be around you.

77
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:27,638
I'm marrying someone else.

78
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:31,422
You don't love him, do you? You don't even seem to like him.

79
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:33,456
But I do love my people.

80
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,071
You're not marrying them.

81
00:05:36,112 --> 00:05:40,413
You don't understand. I have duties to my father, to my tribe.

82
00:05:40,438 --> 00:05:43,817
I have to do this, goodbye!

83
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:53,258
The day we have feared for so long has arrived. The Fire Nation is on our doorstep.

84
00:05:53,282 --> 00:05:58,178
It is with great sadness I call my family here before me,...

85
00:05:58,228 --> 00:06:05,157
...knowing well that some of these faces are about to vanish from our tribe.

86
00:06:05,204 --> 00:06:09,116
But they will never vanish from our hearts.

87
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:17,243
Now, as we approach the battle for our existence, I call upon the great spirits!

88
00:06:17,278 --> 00:06:23,294
Spirit of the Ocean! Spirit of the Moon! Be with us!

89
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:27,424
I'm going to need volunteers for a dangerous mission.

90
00:06:27,448 --> 00:06:28,605
Count me in.

91
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:29,881
Sokka!

92
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,753
Be warned. Many of you will not return.

93
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:39,959
Come forward to receive my mark if you accept the task.

94
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:10,904
The stillness before battle is unbearable. Such a quite dread.

95
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:14,490
I wasn't there when the Fire Nation attacked my people.

96
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:17,729
I'm gonna make a difference this time.

97
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:04,316
Yip! Yip!

98
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:10,514
Katara!?

99
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:35,126
I'll take it from here, boy!

100
00:09:43,908 --> 00:09:45,938
Appa!

101
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:51,380
Thanks for the rescue, buddy!

102
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:14,902
You have got to be kidding me.

103
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:19,980
Men, you'll be infiltrating the Fire Nation navy.

104
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:25,074
That means you'll all need one of these uniforms...

105
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:31,220
What's your problem?

106
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,840
Fire Navy uniforms don't look like that.

107
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:39,452
Of course they do. These are real uniforms captured from actual Fire Navy soldiers.

108
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:41,916
When, like a hundred years ago?

109
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,554
Eighty five.

110
00:10:43,624 --> 00:10:45,862
The Fire Nation doesn't wear shoulder spikes anymore.

111
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,848
The newer uniforms are more streamlined.

112
00:10:48,908 --> 00:10:53,366
How do we know we can trust this guy? Such bold talk for a new recruit.

113
00:10:53,422 --> 00:11:00,464
Sokka is from our sister tribe, Hahn, he is a capable warrior and I value his input.

114
00:11:00,548 --> 00:11:06,314
Now, our first objective is to determine the identity of their commanding officer.

115
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:11,818
His name is Zhao. Middle-aged. Big sideburns. Bigger temper.

116
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:17,478
Sokka, I want you to tell everything you know to Hahn, he is leading this mission.

117
00:11:17,515 --> 00:11:25,922
Hahn, show Sokka your respect. I expect nothing less from my future son-in-law.

118
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:27,719
Princess Yue's marrying you?

119
00:11:27,748 --> 00:11:29,401
Yeh, what of it?

120
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:32,733
Nothing, congratulations.

121
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,732
Stop those fireballs!

122
00:11:49,229 --> 00:11:51,367
It's almost twilight, Admiral.

123
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,588
As your military consultant I must advise you to halt your attack.

124
00:11:55,636 --> 00:12:00,808
The waterbenders draw their power from the moon and it is nearly full tonight.

125
00:12:00,831 --> 00:12:04,078
You should wait and resume the attack at daybreak.

126
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:09,001
Oh, I'm well aware of the moon problem and I am working on a solution.

127
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:12,821
But for now, daybreak it is.

128
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:20,322
They've stopped firing.

129
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,486
Aang!

130
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:31,186
I can't do it. I can't do it.

131
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:32,057
What happened?

132
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:34,771
I must have taken out a dozen Fire Navy ships,...

133
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,098
...but there's just too many of them. I can't fight them all.

134
00:12:39,117 --> 00:12:42,381
But, you have to! You're the Avatar!

135
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:45,808
I'm just one kid.

136
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:56,752
If you're fishing for an octopus, my nephew,...

137
00:12:56,782 --> 00:13:03,149
...you need a tightly woven net or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape.

138
00:13:03,192 --> 00:13:05,441
I don't need your wisdom right now, Uncle.

139
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:12,335
I'm sorry, I just nag you because, well, ever since I lost my son...

140
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:14,939
Uncle, you don't have to say it.

141
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:18,670
I think of you as my own.

142
00:13:19,572 --> 00:13:23,089
I know, Uncle. We'll meet again...

143
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,796
...after I have the Avatar.

144
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:33,153
Remember your Breathe of Fire! It could save your life out there!

145
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:34,420
I will.

146
00:13:34,468 --> 00:13:37,520
And put your hood up, keep your ears warm!

147
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:39,656
I'll be fine.

148
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:50,552
Let me tell ya, Sokka, I've courted a lot of girls,...

149
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:54,294
...but Yue is the finest... and she comes with the most perks.

150
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:56,506
Perks!? What does that mean?

151
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,749
I mean, Yue's nice and everything,...

152
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,072
...but the points I'll get with the Chief aren't bad either.

153
00:14:01,123 --> 00:14:04,948
Princess Yue is wasted on a self absorbed weasel like you!

154
00:14:04,992 --> 00:14:07,628
Whoa. Hang on. What do you care?

155
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,209
You're just a simple rube from the Southern Tribe.

156
00:14:10,226 --> 00:14:15,985
What would you know of the political complexities of our life? No offense.

157
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:22,637
You're just a jerk without a soul! No offense!

158
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:28,478
That's enough! Sokka, you're off the mission.

159
00:14:28,496 --> 00:14:30,378
All right, fall in men!

160
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:35,137
Everybody listen to what I say and we'll take out this Admiral Jo in no time.

161
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:37,875
It's Admiral Zhao!

162
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:15,317
Where are they going?

163
00:15:16,763 --> 00:15:19,940
They're coming up for air somewhere...

164
00:15:28,132 --> 00:15:30,953
The legends say the moon was the first waterbender.

165
00:15:30,975 --> 00:15:33,614
Our ancestors saw how it pushed and pulled the tides...

166
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:35,576
...and learned how to do it themselves.

167
00:15:35,617 --> 00:15:39,434
I've always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night.

168
00:15:39,475 --> 00:15:42,048
Our strength comes from the Spirit of the Moon,...

169
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:47,812
...our life comes from the Spirit of the Ocean. They work together to keep balance.

170
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:51,702
The Spirits! Maybe I can find them and get their help!

171
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:53,225
How can you do that?

172
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:56,794
The Avatar is the bridge between our world and the Spirit World.

173
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:58,496
Aang can talk to them!

174
00:15:58,552 --> 00:16:01,485
Maybe they'll give you the wisdom to win this battle!

175
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:06,916
Or, maybe they'll unleash a crazy amazing spirit attack on the Fire Nation!

176
00:16:07,277 --> 00:16:09,269
Or wisdom. That's good too.

177
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:13,350
The only problem is, last time you got to the Spirit World by accident.

178
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,124
How are you going to get there this time?

179
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:17,837
I have an idea, follow me.

180
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,988
So is this the way to the Spirit World?

181
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:29,573
No, you'll have to get there on your own.

182
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:34,857
But I can take you to the most spiritual place in the entire North Pole.

183
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:53,454
I never thought I'd miss grass this much!

184
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,522
It's so warm here! How is that possible?

185
00:16:56,542 --> 00:17:00,805
It's the center of all spiritual energy in our land.

186
00:17:09,092 --> 00:17:16,626
You're right, Yue. I can feel... something... it's so... tranquil.

187
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:35,861
Be quiet!

188
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,222
Is something wrong, Sokka?

189
00:17:57,265 --> 00:17:59,840
Oh no! Hahn's out there on the top secret mission...

190
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:03,445
...while I'm here sharpening my boomerang. Everything's fine!

191
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:07,580
Listen to me. I took you off the mission for selfish reasons.

192
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:10,893
I have a special task in mind for you.

193
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:12,705
What? You want me to scrub the barracks?

194
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,029
I want you to guard my daughter, Princess Yue.

195
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:21,905
Er, sure. That shouldn't be too hard.

196
00:19:13,797 --> 00:19:15,861
Why is he sitting like that?

197
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:19,550
He's meditating... trying to cross over into the Spirit World.

198
00:19:19,596 --> 00:19:22,210
It takes all his concentration.

199
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,726
Is there any way we can help?

200
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:29,850
How 'bout some quiet!? C'mon guys! I can hear every word you're saying!

201
00:19:49,308 --> 00:19:50,420
Is he okay?

202
00:19:50,477 --> 00:19:55,056
He's crossing into the Spirit World. He'll be fine as long as we don't move his body.

203
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,201
That's his way back to the physical world.

204
00:19:57,244 --> 00:19:58,516
Maybe we should get some help?

205
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:03,049
No, he's my friend. I'm perfectly capable of protecting him.

206
00:20:03,075 --> 00:20:06,067
Well, aren't you a big girl now?

207
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,037
No!

208
00:20:07,068 --> 00:20:11,750
Yes! Hand him over, and I won't have to hurt you.

209
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:27,528
I see you've learned a new trick. But I didn't come this far to lose to you.

210
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:52,054
You little peasant. You've found a master, haven't you?

211
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:30,384
It's daybreak at last. Let's write history.

212
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:56,441
You rise with the moon. I rise with the sun.

213
00:22:07,122 --> 00:22:15,051
The Water Tribe can try to resist the inevitable, but their city will fall today.

214
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,945
Aang!

215
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,413
What happened? Where's Zuko?

216
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:30,754
He took Aang. He took him right out from under me.

217
00:22:30,803 --> 00:22:33,036
Where did they go?

218
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,858
