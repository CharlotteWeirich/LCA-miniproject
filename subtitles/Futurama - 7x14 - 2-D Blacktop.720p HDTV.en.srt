00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:22,652
And finally, I'm sure
you've all noticed

3
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:25,188
the fabulous chandelier
you'll be delivering.

4
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:26,606
What? Where?

5
00:00:26,807 --> 00:00:27,675
Up there.

6
00:00:29,192 --> 00:00:30,228
Nice.

7
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:31,769
It's extremely delicate,

8
00:00:31,836 --> 00:00:34,305
so if one of you breaks it,
you're paying for it!

9
00:00:34,356 --> 00:00:35,672
- Fry did it!
- Did what?

10
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:37,641
Just practicing for later.

11
00:00:40,678 --> 00:00:42,613
Ah, perfect timing.

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,916
I just turbocharged
the ship's matter compressor.

13
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:47,485
What's the matter compressor?

14
00:00:47,552 --> 00:00:49,320
Nothing's the matter, Fry,

15
00:00:49,387 --> 00:00:52,039
now that I've turbocharged
the matter compressor.

16
00:00:52,123 --> 00:00:54,325
Instead
of making the ship faster,

17
00:00:54,376 --> 00:00:56,544
how about installing
some seat belts?

18
00:00:56,628 --> 00:00:58,212
Seat belts are dead weight.

19
00:00:58,296 --> 00:01:00,998
I feel the need for speed!

20
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:04,301
Yes, but <i>I</i> feel
the nafety for safety.

21
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:07,004
Oh, fuff! I don't get
all up in <i>your</i> business

22
00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:08,806
when you upgrade your bazooms!

23
00:01:08,873 --> 00:01:10,307
That's because my bazooms

24
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:12,309
don't put anyone's life
in danger!

25
00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:16,096
Done broke my spine.

26
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:17,714
Nice rack, though.

27
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:19,266
Thank you, Scruffy.

28
00:01:30,495 --> 00:01:31,829
Oh!

29
00:01:31,896 --> 00:01:34,498
You wrecked my
dear ship, Bessie?!

30
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:36,283
I just finished naming her.

31
00:01:36,368 --> 00:01:37,901
Never mind the ship.

32
00:01:37,953 --> 00:01:38,953
What about us?

33
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,090
Fry did it!

34
00:01:45,076 --> 00:01:46,743
We've had it with
this flying slaughterhouse.

35
00:01:46,795 --> 00:01:48,712
We're having it
towed away for scrap,

36
00:01:48,763 --> 00:01:51,131
and we're getting
a new, safer ship.

37
00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:57,638
Here I comes to save the days.

38
00:02:03,895 --> 00:02:06,030
This is how you treat me?

39
00:02:06,097 --> 00:02:09,617
After all the good news I've
given you over the years?

40
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:11,402
Well, if you don't want Bessie,

41
00:02:11,453 --> 00:02:13,037
you don't want me.

42
00:02:13,104 --> 00:02:14,288
Good-bye!

43
00:02:16,274 --> 00:02:19,488
_

44
00:02:24,115 --> 00:02:25,716
Don't worry, shippums,

45
00:02:25,783 --> 00:02:28,636
with a whole junkyard
of spare parts to work with,

46
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,221
I'll turn you into a tepid rod.

47
00:02:32,507 --> 00:02:35,792
Oh, what the heck-- a hot rod!

48
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:38,646
Ooh! Ooh!

49
00:02:42,434 --> 00:02:46,186
Ah... time for
the mornings meltsdowns.

50
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,911
I'll pay you back, I swear.

51
00:02:53,978 --> 00:02:56,363
Yeah, yeah,
I heards its befores.

52
00:03:01,152 --> 00:03:04,154
Next up,
the Planet Expresses ship.

53
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:09,093
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

54
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,511
Whats the...?

55
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:12,513
In your face, sucker!

56
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:16,350
Also, I'll send you a check
for the parts I stole!

57
00:03:16,434 --> 00:03:19,353
Okays, ya honest young punk!

58
00:03:19,437 --> 00:03:21,939
Now ons to the next junker.

59
00:03:33,451 --> 00:03:35,486
Ah, the open road!

60
00:03:35,537 --> 00:03:37,705
Not a ship ahead of me.

61
00:03:41,826 --> 00:03:44,662
Yo, Methuselah, speed it up!

62
00:03:44,713 --> 00:03:48,716
You're making the roads unsafe
for us maniac street racers!

63
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,751
Step off, you greasers!

64
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:53,721
I was street-racing back when
ships still ran on moonwater!

65
00:03:53,805 --> 00:03:55,222
Damn, yo,

66
00:03:55,306 --> 00:03:57,307
get a load of speed geezer!

67
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,927
Hey!

68
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:01,595
That's it, you hoodlums!

69
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,481
Your mouth just wrote
a PayPal transfer request

70
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:07,384
that your butt has
insufficient funds to honor!

71
00:04:07,435 --> 00:04:08,719
Yo, it is on!

72
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,604
Before that, it was off.

73
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:13,524
Twice around Central Park.
Loser has to make the winner's

74
00:04:13,575 --> 00:04:16,076
Medicare copayments for a year!

75
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:17,027
A'ight.

76
00:04:17,078 --> 00:04:18,562
On three. One...

77
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,916
Aw, it just got real.

78
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:25,502
So real I don't believe it.

79
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,587
...two...

80
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:34,411
Aw, man, I can't afford
no Medicare copayments!

81
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:37,047
...three!

82
00:04:42,354 --> 00:04:44,273
_

83
00:04:49,444 --> 00:04:51,028
Whoa...!

84
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:55,365
Wrinkles got some
mad moves, yo.

85
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:57,868
Yo, Wrinkles,
you got big glasses.

86
00:04:57,935 --> 00:04:59,620
I'm gonna call you
the Professor.

87
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:02,206
What?! No one calls me that!

88
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,877
Hey, Minx, we survive this,

89
00:05:06,944 --> 00:05:08,945
can I finally get that date?

90
00:05:08,997 --> 00:05:10,831
Nah. You know
I'm with Benny.

91
00:05:10,915 --> 00:05:12,416
Girl, he don't own you!

92
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:15,469
Yeah, but he saved me
from my abusive father.

93
00:05:15,553 --> 00:05:18,055
Not physically abusive;
verbally.

94
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:20,974
It's a long story I can't get
into while we're spinning out.

95
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:48,985
Ow! Paper cut!

96
00:05:50,455 --> 00:05:52,005
Whoa!

97
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,373
Hey, Earl,

98
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,625
it's that
street-racing gang

99
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:56,593
we've been trying
to bust for years.

100
00:05:56,661 --> 00:05:58,345
Unsuccessfully, I might add.

101
00:05:58,429 --> 00:06:01,348
Guess this is your
lucky day, Pimparoo.

102
00:06:01,432 --> 00:06:03,667
Those punks have
endangered our citizens

103
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:05,219
for the last time.

104
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:10,524
Ironic!

105
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:15,529
Whoa, it's the police!

106
00:06:15,613 --> 00:06:16,947
Let's turn and burn!

107
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:23,019
Running off, eh?

108
00:06:23,071 --> 00:06:24,688
You're pathetic!

109
00:06:24,739 --> 00:06:26,573
You wouldn't be scared
of the po-po

110
00:06:26,658 --> 00:06:28,492
if you had a ship like mine.

111
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:30,527
Yo, Professor,
if your ship's so dope,

112
00:06:30,578 --> 00:06:32,796
why are those cops on your tail

113
00:06:32,864 --> 00:06:35,883
like my dad's verbal abuse
on my psyche.

114
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:38,752
'Cause you haven't seen
what old Bessie can do yet.

115
00:06:38,837 --> 00:06:41,305
Sayonara, Tokyo driftwood!

116
00:06:49,814 --> 00:06:51,982
- What the what?!
- Whoa, snap!

117
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:54,101
Dude pulled
a dimensional drift!

118
00:06:56,905 --> 00:06:58,572
I can't believe
we lost 'em again.

119
00:06:58,656 --> 00:06:59,890
I need a drink.

120
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:01,909
Nah. We're on the job.

121
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:04,895
Let's just go pepper-spray
some homeless families.

122
00:07:11,836 --> 00:07:13,170
- Whoa! - Wow!
- Gee!

123
00:07:13,237 --> 00:07:14,972
That was a sick move, yo!

124
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,908
Thank you.
I have no idea what that means.

125
00:07:17,976 --> 00:07:19,877
You got a death wish, Professor.

126
00:07:19,944 --> 00:07:22,179
Something must've happened
in your life that hurt you,

127
00:07:22,247 --> 00:07:23,580
just like us.

128
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:26,717
In my case,
it was verbal abuse.

129
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:28,819
That's in the
rearview mirror, baby.

130
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:31,154
It wasn't what
he <i>said</i> that hurt,

131
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:33,924
it was what was left unsaid.

132
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:36,927
Sometimes the best way to
deal with your problems

133
00:07:36,995 --> 00:07:39,329
is to drive away
from 'em real fast.

134
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:42,199
So, yo, you want to
hook up with our crew?

135
00:07:45,803 --> 00:07:49,172
Again, no idea what that means.

136
00:07:53,078 --> 00:07:54,662
Good news, everyone!

137
00:07:54,747 --> 00:07:56,664
Our safe new ship has arrived,

138
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:58,649
and it's gonna
knock your socks on...

139
00:07:58,701 --> 00:07:59,917
where they belong.

140
00:07:59,985 --> 00:08:00,918
Ta-da!

141
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:05,039
Ooh. Ah.

142
00:08:05,124 --> 00:08:07,008
Is it inside that box?

143
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:08,676
No. That's the ship.

144
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:10,995
The boxy shape keeps it
from going too fast.

145
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:12,329
And check out the interior.

146
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:17,852
Note the rear-facing
safety seats.

147
00:08:17,936 --> 00:08:19,053
Cool!

148
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,190
Hey, wait.
If I'm backwards,

149
00:08:22,274 --> 00:08:24,008
I can't see out the windshield.

150
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:25,443
There is no windshield.

151
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,562
Who needs a big,
breakable piece of glass

152
00:08:27,646 --> 00:08:29,180
when we can just
monitor everything

153
00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:31,365
on the padded dashboard display?

154
00:08:33,152 --> 00:08:35,153
At least there's a cup holder.

155
00:08:35,204 --> 00:08:36,654
That's an <i>arm</i> holder.

156
00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:38,623
Hey!

157
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,625
Well, let's break this ship in.

158
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:43,027
This package is going
to Glorionimous 3,

159
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:46,414
which orbits an incredible
rainbow giant star.

160
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:47,832
All right!

161
00:08:47,883 --> 00:08:50,084
Let's ride!

162
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:07,685
Safe and sound.

163
00:09:07,736 --> 00:09:10,321
♪ Bender is bored,
Bender is bored ♪

164
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:11,823
♪ Bender, Bender, Bender... ♪

165
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,075
Leela, Bender's bothering me!

166
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,077
Driver distraction detected.

167
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:17,895
♪ Bender, Bender, Bender ♪

168

_

169
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,541
Amazing!

170
00:09:30,609 --> 00:09:32,376
You multicultural punks

171
00:09:32,444 --> 00:09:34,912
just race and tinker
all day long?

172
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,681
And we rap about our problems.

173
00:09:36,748 --> 00:09:38,382
Like my aunt's neighbor
is a hoarder.

174
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,351
Stack of magazines
fell on her cat.

175
00:09:40,418 --> 00:09:42,470
It's hard, you know?

176
00:09:42,554 --> 00:09:44,605
Yo, you're not alone.

177
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,091
Hey, Professor, that
dimensional drift was hot!

178
00:09:47,142 --> 00:09:48,526
How'd you rock that?

179
00:09:48,593 --> 00:09:50,111
It's simple, Minx.

180
00:09:50,195 --> 00:09:51,262
All you need

181
00:09:51,313 --> 00:09:54,431
is a 4-D intake manifold.

182
00:09:56,985 --> 00:09:58,936
It sucks in fourth dimension,

183
00:09:58,987 --> 00:10:01,572
creating a friction-less
wormhole.

184
00:10:01,623 --> 00:10:03,040
- Whoa!
- Dig that!

185
00:10:03,108 --> 00:10:06,043
Ain't no thing
but a hyperchicken wing.

186
00:10:09,414 --> 00:10:10,381
What?

187
00:10:10,448 --> 00:10:12,166
Huh. I guess we're here.

188
00:10:12,251 --> 00:10:13,968
Let's make the delivery.

189
00:10:16,421 --> 00:10:18,339
Delivery auto-completed.

190
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:20,675
Welcome home, heroes!

191
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,593
The ship did everything?

192
00:10:22,644 --> 00:10:24,512
But we didn't have
an adventure.

193
00:10:24,596 --> 00:10:26,347
This is a delivery company.

194
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,233
We need <i>less</i> adventures,
not <i>more</i> adventures.

195
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:31,319
Now come on, let's go
to the ready room

196
00:10:31,403 --> 00:10:33,571
and wait
for our next assignment.

197
00:10:38,861 --> 00:10:41,329
- Leela...
- Ready for action, sir!

198
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:42,813
Uh... okay.

199
00:10:42,865 --> 00:10:45,032
I need you
to pick up a few groceries.

200
00:10:45,117 --> 00:10:48,252
Oh, and on the way, drop off Fry
and Bender at karate class.

201
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,787
Oh, right, it's Wednesday!

202
00:10:49,838 --> 00:10:51,873
Today we're gonna learn
spinny kicks!

203
00:10:51,957 --> 00:10:53,324
Yay!

204
00:10:54,093 --> 00:10:56,093
_

205
00:10:59,678 --> 00:11:02,512
_

206
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,788
Stop sign in 75 feet.

207
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:25,740
Stop sign in 50 feet.

208
00:11:25,824 --> 00:11:27,959
I know how to stop
at a stop sign!

209
00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:35,716
Yo, soccer mom, speed it up!

210
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:37,752
Move that lunch bucket!

211
00:11:39,137 --> 00:11:40,304
Oh, Leela!

212
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:41,889
Professor?!

213
00:11:41,974 --> 00:11:44,141
What did you do
to the Planet Express ship?

214
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:46,594
And why are you wearing
a leather lab coat?

215
00:11:46,678 --> 00:11:48,846
Because unlike you, I'm cool.

216
00:11:48,897 --> 00:11:51,899
I drive fast late at night
when I should be sleeping.

217
00:11:51,984 --> 00:11:54,819
But <i>you</i> wouldn't understand.

218
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:57,855
I understand I can still
outdrive <i>your</i> saggy ass,

219
00:11:57,906 --> 00:11:59,690
even in <i>this</i> clunker.

220
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:01,158
- Ooh! - Ooh!
- Ooh!

221
00:12:01,226 --> 00:12:03,727
That one-eyed housewife
called you out!

222
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:06,397
When and where, PTA?

223
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:12,920
What kind of glorked
up drag strip is this?

224
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:14,738
Möbius drag strip, man.

225
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:23,431
Okay, no cops,
no laws, no rules.

226
00:12:23,515 --> 00:12:25,082
Now here are the rules.

227
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:27,768
Once around both same-sides
of the half-twist

228
00:12:27,853 --> 00:12:29,637
and back
to the starting finish line.

229
00:12:29,721 --> 00:12:30,604
Ready?

230
00:12:33,425 --> 00:12:35,860
Leela, Professor,
don't do this!

231
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:37,428
It's too exciting!

232
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:39,814
Mark... set...

233
00:12:39,898 --> 00:12:41,315
go, yo!

234
00:12:54,246 --> 00:12:56,664
One more lap!

235
00:12:56,748 --> 00:12:58,582
Nah, half a lap.

236
00:12:58,633 --> 00:13:00,968
You forgot, on a Möbius
strip, two laps is one lap.

237
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,722
You kids and your topology.

238
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,597
The lady from work is winning!

239
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:17,435
Looks like you're
about to lose to a minivan.

240
00:13:17,486 --> 00:13:20,905
Unless you have any surprise
moves you've forgotten about.

241
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:23,640
No, no. Wait!

242
00:13:23,692 --> 00:13:25,693
Dimensional drift!

243
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:42,843
Now who's in the lead?!

244
00:13:42,928 --> 00:13:45,730
Seriously, I have no idea.

245
00:13:58,727 --> 00:14:01,695
Hooray!
A tie!

246
00:14:06,162 --> 00:14:08,696
Do you think
they're... dead?

247
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,965
No, no. I choose
to believe

248
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:13,084
they're alive
in some other dimension.

249
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:14,702
Screaming in agony.

250
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:17,371
I hope so.

251
00:14:25,214 --> 00:14:26,931
What's going on?

252
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:29,818
Why do I look like
a stupid cartoon character?

253
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:31,319
I feel like I lost weight.

254
00:14:31,386 --> 00:14:33,554
- All of it.
- Remarkable!

255
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,157
It seems that colliding
at relativistic speed

256
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:39,444
has collapsed us down
into two dimensions.

257
00:14:39,528 --> 00:14:41,395
Oh, no! Like Flatland?

258
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,531
Call it what you will.

259
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,501
The point is, the new <i>Shrek</i>
movie won't look nearly as good.

260
00:14:46,568 --> 00:14:48,903
I was taking a nap
in the back seat.

261
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,588
Anything happen while I was...?

262
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:58,746
Bloods on the Möbius strip.

263
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:01,132
When will these kids learns?

264
00:15:04,854 --> 00:15:07,088
So now what happens?

265
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,275
It's the end of Planet Express
and life as we know it.

266
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:13,111
We're out of business
unless we find a new crew!

267
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:14,696
Yo, dawg, we're a crew.

268
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:16,731
Well, that solves that.

269
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:20,652
If we're gonna be co-workers,
I got to be straight with you.

270
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:22,403
I've been...

271
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:26,791
emotionally scarred by years
of unspoken verbal abuse.

272
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:28,159
I'm Zoidberg.

273
00:15:28,244 --> 00:15:30,462
Nice to meet you!

274
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:34,132
Hey, Flatso, how do we get out
of this two-bit dimension?

275
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:35,717
There's a simple
answer for that.

276
00:15:35,784 --> 00:15:37,168
We can't.

277
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,804
But on the upside,

278
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:42,173
we've got a whole dimension
to explore

279
00:15:42,258 --> 00:15:45,009
with entirely
different laws of physics.

280
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:48,129
Why, watch what happens
when I drop this marble.

281
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,066
Well, that's the same,

282
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:54,185
but other things are different.

283
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,905
Come, look at this
two-dimensional bird's nest.

284
00:15:56,972 --> 00:15:58,439
Ooh, me first!

285
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,241
I'll just step past Leela here.

286
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:01,693
- Ow!
- Ow!

287
00:16:01,777 --> 00:16:03,978
You can't step past
in this dimension.

288
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,663
You have to step around.

289
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:11,703
Observe
this two-dimensional egg.

290
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:14,422
If we were in the third
dimension, looking down,

291
00:16:14,489 --> 00:16:17,258
we'd be able to see
an unhatched chick in it,

292
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:19,844
just as a chick inside
a three-dimensional egg

293
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:22,597
could be seen by an observer
in the fourth dimension.

294
00:16:22,664 --> 00:16:24,382
Fourth dimension?!

295
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:26,351
I can't picture
that! You're dumb.

296
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:28,353
Halt!

297
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:30,004
Who said that?

298
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,173
All I see are a bunch
of vertical line segments.

299
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,008
We are the Lords of Flatbush.

300
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,978
Come. The king has declared
a feast in your honor.

301
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:39,614
Wow. How did he even know
we're here?

302
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:41,199
'Cause I'm him.
Let's eat.

303
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:01,753
The feast is served!

304
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:04,038
Choose whatever two-dimensional
foods you like.

305
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,391
Crepes, flatbread,
McDonald's hamburgers.

306
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:07,809
You get the idea.

307
00:17:07,876 --> 00:17:10,061
Yum! Apples!

308
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,317
Hey, how come I can't swallow?

309
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:18,069
Hmm. I guess
it's because

310
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:22,056
our two-ended digestive system
can't exist in this dimension.

311
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,192
I suppose
that could be an issue.

312
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:28,830
I knew it. I knew
he'd get us killed somehow.

313
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:30,915
As you can see, or
rather can't see,

314
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,867
but take my word for it,

315
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,086
such a digestive
system would divide

316
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,406
a 2-D being into
separate pieces!

317
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,008
So how are we supposed
to eat and digest?

318
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,215
Got it.

319
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,417
Well, since we have
no digestive systems here,

320
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:53,605
I guess we'd better get back to
the third dimension after all.

321
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:55,589
Third dimension?
I can't picture that!

322
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:56,975
You're dumb.

323
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,729
There's nothing funny
about science!

324
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,598
If there can be an X-axis
and a Y-axis,

325
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,234
why not a Z-axis?

326
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,569
He's opening our minds
to new ideas!

327
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,038
Kill him!

328
00:18:19,614 --> 00:18:20,548
To the ship!

329
00:18:20,615 --> 00:18:21,449
Which ship?

330
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,834
Leela's!

331
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:24,135
It's safer.

332
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:25,336
Safety kills.
We got to move!

333
00:18:32,728 --> 00:18:34,896
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

334
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:37,398
Oh, what's the point of fleeing?

335
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:39,517
Even if we escape
from those creatures,

336
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:42,487
we'll still be stuck in
this dimension till we starve.

337
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:44,656
Wait. What about
a dimensional drift?

338
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,191
If it went through
the fourth dimension before,

339
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:49,410
maybe here, it'll go
through the third dimension!

340
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:51,496
By God, you're right!

341
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,981
But to keep us there,
I'd need to accelerate

342
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,817
to dimensional escape velocity
<i>during</i> the drift.

343
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,671
Oh, if only Minx
could see that.

344
00:18:59,755 --> 00:19:03,374
Then she'd see me as more
than just a father figure.

345
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:15,002
Now's good.

346
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,515
Two point one dimensions!

347
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:28,783
Two point two!

348
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:30,351
Two point pi!

349
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,620
Look, up there!
There's some up!

350
00:19:32,688 --> 00:19:34,389
The third dimension!

351
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:38,576
Indeed, but we're about to crash
into some sort of huge disk!

352
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:43,131
My bowels returned
at a bad time!

353
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:49,037
I'd likes to say a few words.

354
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:52,407
I'm gonna burns them ups.

355
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:15,947
Oh!

356
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,939
We're back, baby!

357
00:20:26,942 --> 00:20:29,977
It's been an emotional
five minutes,

358
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:32,346
but I guess everything
worked out in the end.

359
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:34,582
Yo, boss, not everything.

360
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:44,158
Hello?

361
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:45,693
Dad?!

362
00:20:58,026 --> 00:21:00,500
