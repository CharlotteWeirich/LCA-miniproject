1
00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:09,329  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:490 Y2:516
The Day the Earth Stood Stupid

2
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:08,002  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:061 Y2:126
- Is Nibbler stoked for the show?
- He ought to be, with all the training.

3
00:01:08,213 --> 00:01:13,162  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:061 Y2:121
Nibbler, roll over and you get a ham.
Roll over. Roll over for the ham.

4
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:20,001  X1:093 X2:623 Y1:061 Y2:082
You are so adorable. Who wants a ham?

5
00:01:22,093 --> 00:01:23,242  X1:257 X2:457 Y1:061 Y2:082
Zooka barooka!

6
00:01:23,493 --> 00:01:27,611  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:061 Y2:126
First prize is $500
and a year's supply of dog food!

7
00:01:27,813 --> 00:01:32,807  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:061 Y2:126
- Five hundred dollars, you say?
- Dog food, you say?

8
00:01:36,773 --> 00:01:40,243  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:061 Y2:122
That dog's gonna be hard to beat.
Look at him.

9
00:01:40,493 --> 00:01:42,404  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:061 Y2:087
One sheep, two sheep...

10
00:01:43,293 --> 00:01:44,806  X1:264 X2:452 Y1:061 Y2:087
...three sheep.

11
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:49,648  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:061 Y2:126
But our real competition
is the Hypno-Toad.

12
00:02:07,973 --> 00:02:10,646  X1:237 X2:477 Y1:061 Y2:126
Your turn, Nibbler.
Herd those sheep!

13
00:02:13,773 --> 00:02:15,604  X1:242 X2:474 Y1:061 Y2:084
Come on, Nibbler!

14
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:27,606  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:451 Y2:516
I have a late entry. My hard-shelled
whooping terrier, Mr. Zoidberg.

15
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,809  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:495 Y2:516
Faster! Faster!

16
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:46,407  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:451 Y2:516
Suck in that gut!
You wanna be spayed?

17
00:02:50,493 --> 00:02:53,565  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:456 Y2:516
Silence, you cur!
Puff out that brisket!

18
00:02:59,853 --> 00:03:02,731  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:489 Y2:516
I should be weeping! I'm not weeping!

19
00:03:10,613 --> 00:03:12,604  X1:234 X2:481 Y1:490 Y2:516
I love these things.

20
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:17,847  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:490 Y2:516
Shake paws, Nibbler. Come on, shake.

21
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:23,406  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:451 Y2:516
He might be a little hungry. Usually,
he's had more ham by now. Shake!

22
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:55,404  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:451 Y2:516
Third prize, a party-sized keg
of guinea pigs, goes to...

23
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:58,889  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:454 Y2:516
...Dave Spiegel
and his owner, Fluffers.

24
00:04:00,893 --> 00:04:06,286  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:451 Y2:516
Second prize, this lovely afghan,
made from an Afghan, goes to...

25
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:09,246  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:490 Y2:516
...Bender and his whooping terrier!

26
00:04:09,493 --> 00:04:15,204  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:450 Y2:516
Second place? That's a fancy word for
losing! You didn't stick your landing!

27
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:18,166  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Forgive me, my friend.
- Never!

28
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:23,163  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
And before we announce the winner,
we have a special award for...

29
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:26,729  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:451 Y2:516
...Ms. Leela and her
mystery pet, Nibbler!

30
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,844  X1:279 X2:439 Y1:495 Y2:516
Me? Award?

31
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:30,811  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:495 Y2:516
Him? Me? Good?

32
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:34,602  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's the eloquence you'd
expect from the owner of...

33
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:36,849  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:495 Y2:516
...Dumbest Pet in Show!

34
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:43,573  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:490 Y2:516
And the grand prize winner:

35
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:46,611  X1:246 X2:468 Y1:490 Y2:516
The Hypno-Toad!

36
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:52,489  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:490 Y2:516
All glory to the Hypno-Toad!

37
00:04:56,173 --> 00:04:59,324  X1:198 X2:516 Y1:450 Y2:516
Ah, maybe they're right.
Maybe Nibbler is dumb.

38
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:03,725  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:450 Y2:516
Don't listen to them. People said
I was dumb, but I proved them.

39
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:08,802  X1:094 X2:622 Y1:451 Y2:516
Good news. We were supposed to make
a delivery to the planet Tweenis 1 2.

40
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:11,248  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:489 Y2:516
But it's been completely destroyed.

41
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:14,684  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Why is that good news?
- They paid in advance.

42
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:17,327  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Excuse me.
- This is mighty strange.

43
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,801  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:490 Y2:516
First, Space Rome collapsed.

44
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:25,006  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:456 Y2:516
Then, Don Martin 3 went caflooie.
And now Tweenis 1 2.

45
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:27,886  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:456 Y2:516
- This planet is next.
- That's Earth.

46
00:05:29,053 --> 00:05:32,523  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:451 Y2:516
- The planet we live on?
- I'd hate to be those guys.

47
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:43,724  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:516
What's got into him? He's twitching
like Zoidberg when you say "food."

48
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:44,968  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:493 Y2:516
What, now?

49
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:49,161  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:493 Y2:516
No! Nibbler, come back!

50
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:58,250  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:450 Y2:516
Too bad Nibbler's not around.
I'll have to eat this raw ham myself.

51
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:03,882  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:495 Y2:516
Nibbler?

52
00:06:04,773 --> 00:06:07,162  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:489 Y2:516
Nibbler, you're scaring me.

53
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:17,691  X1:302 X2:413 Y1:495 Y2:516
Nibbler?!

54
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:26,807  X1:241 X2:475 Y1:490 Y2:516
Am I going crazy?

55
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,125  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:451 Y2:516
Have my years of hedonism
caught up with me?

56
00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:41,972  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:489 Y2:516
Nibbler, help! Don't leave me here!

57
00:06:58,253 --> 00:07:02,292  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:451 Y2:516
Nibbler? Could you scooch
the seat up, just a little bit?

58
00:07:17,413 --> 00:07:20,530  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Leela back yet?
- Help me! My heart stopped!

59
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:25,801  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:516
- You don't have one. You're a robot.
- Sure. Right. Robot.

60
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,732  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:489 Y2:516
Oh, Fry! My skin's all dry and clanky.

61
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:32,966  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Well, yeah. Robots are made of metal.
- Am I a robot?

62
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:37,126  X1:096 X2:619 Y1:450 Y2:516
I don't get this scam.
You already have my power of attorney.

63
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:39,451  X1:334 X2:381 Y1:490 Y2:516
Fry!

64
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:41,482  X1:304 X2:412 Y1:490 Y2:516
My skin!

65
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:45,371  X1:274 X2:441 Y1:489 Y2:516
I'm a genius!

66
00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:51,007  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:490 Y2:516
Why is everyone acting so weird?

67
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:53,886  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:456 Y2:516
Zoidbee want balloon!
Want balloon now!

68
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:56,004  X1:192 X2:522 Y1:490 Y2:516
Zoidbee want go outside!

69
00:07:56,213 --> 00:07:58,124  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:490 Y2:516
Oh, I just let you back in!

70
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:03,528  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:451 Y2:516
Unbelievable! I thought you were
a furry little moron.

71
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:08,813  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:451 Y2:516
But here you are flying an adorable
spaceship! If only you could talk.

72
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:12,207  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:495 Y2:516
Wait! I understood that!

73
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:18,206  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:516
You're transmitting your thoughts
directly to my brain?

74
00:08:19,493 --> 00:08:24,408  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:451 Y2:516
You say those awful flying brains
are making everyone on Earth stupid?

75
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:27,604  X1:274 X2:441 Y1:490 Y2:516
Oh, stupider.

76
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:30,930  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:450 Y2:516
And you say we're headed
for your home planet...

77
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:34,483  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:516
...where you've lived since
the beginning of the universe?

78
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:37,366  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:490 Y2:516
So, how did the universe begin?

79
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:45,803  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:490 Y2:516
Then the meaning of existence...?

80
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:47,804  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:490 Y2:516
So every religion is wrong.

81
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,644  X1:284 X2:438 Y1:495 Y2:516
<i>You fell! Hi!</i>

82
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:11,771  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Some bad things happened.</i>
<i>One bad thing was...</i>

83
00:09:11,933 --> 00:09:14,731  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>... a train got crashed. Wanna see?</i>

84
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:18,130  X1:163 X2:549 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>People won 't be late, though.</i>
<i>The governor said:</i>

85
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:21,205  X1:171 X2:549 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>"I'm sending in more trains."</i>

86
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:24,612  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:456 Y2:516
<i>- Go!</i>
<i>- Wait for me!</i>

87
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:27,247  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Morbo can 't understand</i>
<i>his Teleprompter.</i>

88
00:09:27,493 --> 00:09:30,849  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:456 Y2:516
<i>How do you say the letter that</i>
<i>looks like a man with a hat?</i>

89
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:33,004  X1:251 X2:465 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>It's a T. It goes:</i>

90
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:36,091  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</i>

91
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:40,008  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:451 Y2:516
Even the news monster
is acting strange. What to do?

92
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,807  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:489 Y2:516
I know! Let's play the lottery!

93
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:44,645  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:489 Y2:516
Let's buy Internet stock!

94
00:09:44,893 --> 00:09:47,930  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:451 Y2:516
On margin! Zoidbee wanna buy
on margin!

95
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:50,283  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:494 Y2:516
Look at me! I'm invisible!

96
00:09:50,493 --> 00:09:54,122  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:455 Y2:516
I know what's going on!
You've all become idiots!

97
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:58,889  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Hey! Let's all join the Reform Party!
- Oh, yeah!

98
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:17,923  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
Welcome back, ambassador to Earth,
homeworld of the pizza bagel.

99
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:20,886  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:456 Y2:516
I bear many receipts
for reimbursement.

100
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:23,732  X1:089 X2:626 Y1:490 Y2:516
The four welcomes to you as well, Leela.

101
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:27,249  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:451 Y2:516
We shall appear to be
speaking your language.

102
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,451  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Do not be afraid, child.
- I'm not afraid.

103
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:32,172  X1:251 X2:465 Y1:490 Y2:516
Uh, good. Good.

104
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:35,604  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:490 Y2:516
So, your real name is Lord Nibbler?

105
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:37,405  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:490 Y2:516
It is for your sake.

106
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:40,844  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:451 Y2:516
By the time you pronounce
one letter of my name...

107
00:10:41,013 --> 00:10:45,052  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:451 Y2:516
...a trillion cosmoses would sink
into eternal night.

108
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:47,130  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:489 Y2:516
Oh, you're all so cute.

109
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,564  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:490 Y2:516
No, we are an ancient, powerful race.

110
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:55,005  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:451 Y2:516
Behold. When the universe
was forged in the big bang...

111
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:58,370  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:451 Y2:516
...our mighty race was
already 1 7 years old.

112
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:04,250  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:451 Y2:516
For the first millisecond,
things were okay.

113
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:08,372  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:451 Y2:516
But there arose a terrible enemy,
the Brain Spawn.

114
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:16,203  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:451 Y2:516
Ever since, we have waged
unceasing war against these dreadful...

115
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:17,442  X1:259 X2:456 Y1:490 Y2:516
Lunch is ready.

116
00:11:17,613 --> 00:11:20,525  X1:102 X2:613 Y1:490 Y2:516
Then let the feast of 1 000 hams begin!

117
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:28,009  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:451 Y2:516
Why are these Brain Spawn
attacking Earth?

118
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:30,721  X1:170 X2:544 Y1:490 Y2:516
They hate all consciousness.

119
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:35,563  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:451 Y2:516
Thoughts screech at them like
the forced laughs of movie patrons.

120
00:11:35,773 --> 00:11:37,252  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:490 Y2:516
Thus, they travel...

121
00:11:37,493 --> 00:11:41,645  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:451 Y2:516
...making everyone stupid in order
to wipe out all thought.

122
00:11:41,893 --> 00:11:45,806  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:451 Y2:516
Wipe out thought? My God!
They're flying televisions!

123
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:50,803  X1:102 X2:612 Y1:451 Y2:516
And even we are powerless
to stop them, fearsome though we are.

124
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,563  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:456 Y2:516
There is one being
who can resist.

125
00:11:54,733 --> 00:12:00,046  X1:093 X2:621 Y1:456 Y2:516
A child of destiny whose bizarre brain
waves make him immune to their attack.

126
00:12:00,293 --> 00:12:03,205  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:490 Y2:516
He is the hope of the universe.

127
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:09,771  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:451 Y2:516
The fate of your world, perhaps all
worlds, rests in his special mind.

128
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:12,248  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:489 Y2:516
Now, when you say "special"...

129
00:12:18,693 --> 00:12:21,048  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:495 Y2:516
Attention New New Yorkers!

130
00:12:21,293 --> 00:12:25,206  X1:214 X2:500 Y1:490 Y2:516
Stop acting so stupid!

131
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:39,764  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Fleet holding at perimeter of Moron</i>
<i>Zone, formerly known as Earth.</i>

132
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:43,602  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:456 Y2:516
Why would Fry be immune?
Because he doesn't shower?

133
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:47,806  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:451 Y2:516
They suppress intelligence
by attacking delta brain waves.

134
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:52,643  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:454 Y2:516
Every animal and robot generates
this wave, as do certain trees.

135
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:55,930  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:490 Y2:516
Fry, however, does not.

136
00:12:56,573 --> 00:13:01,249  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:451 Y2:516
Somehow, he has cobbled random
brain waves into a working mind.

137
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:05,241  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Like a carpet-remnant prom dress.
- Like your prom dress.

138
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:10,647  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:451 Y2:516
The Brain Spawn are commanded by a
brain with a gooey center of pure hate.

139
00:13:10,853 --> 00:13:15,005  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
Only Fry, with his superior,
yet inferior mind, can approach it.

140
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:18,006  X1:221 X2:494 Y1:456 Y2:516
Tell him to disable it.
We will do the rest.

141
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:20,249  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:456 Y2:516
- You can count on me.
- No.

142
00:13:20,493 --> 00:13:25,806  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:451 Y2:516
- On Earth, you will be too stupid.
- That's why we wrote it down for you.

143
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:30,051  X1:196 X2:518 Y1:451 Y2:516
We also prepared
a bag lunch and mittens.

144
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:35,692  X1:156 X2:558 Y1:451 Y2:516
Time to reeducate you dunces.
We'll start with presidents.

145
00:13:35,893 --> 00:13:39,806  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:451 Y2:516
This was our first president,
George Washington.

146
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:45,772  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:516
Let's review.
Who was our first president?

147
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:50,090  X1:231 X2:486 Y1:456 Y2:516
- A pickle jar?
- Thomas Jefferson?

148
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:56,685  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:450 Y2:516
Leela! I've been so worried!
Are you a bonehead?

149
00:13:56,893 --> 00:13:59,726  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:495 Y2:516
I... have to tell...

150
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:04,489  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:490 Y2:516
...must... important... something...

151
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:06,684  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:489 Y2:516
You're going a mile a minute.

152
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:09,123  X1:236 X2:478 Y1:490 Y2:516
This... you for this!

153
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,607  X1:307 X2:408 Y1:495 Y2:516
Thanks!

154
00:14:11,493 --> 00:14:12,892  X1:337 X2:379 Y1:495 Y2:516
No!

155
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:18,450  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Fire hot!
- The professie will help.

156
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,092  X1:257 X2:458 Y1:495 Y2:516
Fire indeed hot.

157
00:14:25,453 --> 00:14:28,172  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:493 Y2:516
Oh, Chester A. Arthur fall down.

158
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:30,648  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:490 Y2:516
Brain. Brain make people dumb.

159
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:34,607  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:490 Y2:516
No, Leela. Brain make people smart.

160
00:14:40,653 --> 00:14:44,407  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:451 Y2:516
- You go fight biggest brain.
- Even bigger than those?

161
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:47,213  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

162
00:14:47,413 --> 00:14:50,325  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:451 Y2:516
A giant brain is
basically a giant nerd.

163
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:52,848  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:490 Y2:516
And where would a giant nerd be?

164
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:56,610  X1:284 X2:430 Y1:490 Y2:516
The library!

165
00:15:12,173 --> 00:15:13,652  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:495 Y2:516
Pathetic human race.

166
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:17,772  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:456 Y2:516
Arranging knowledge by category
made it easier to absorb.

167
00:15:17,973 --> 00:15:23,001  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:451 Y2:516
Dewey, you fool, your decimal system
has played right into my hands.

168
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:29,730  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:451 Y2:516
- What do you want?
- I'm here to kick your ass!

169
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:35,007  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516
Wishful thinking. We have long since
evolved beyond the need for asses.

170
00:15:38,693 --> 00:15:43,289  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:451 Y2:516
Odd. My stupefaction field
is having no effect on you.

171
00:15:43,493 --> 00:15:47,884  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's right! You'll find a little
knowledge is a dangerous thing!

172
00:15:49,413 --> 00:15:52,610  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:454 Y2:516
Better think of a new plan.
Come on, think.

173
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:55,321  X1:218 X2:496 Y1:490 Y2:516
Thinking. Thinking...

174
00:15:56,653 --> 00:15:58,883  X1:266 X2:450 Y1:490 Y2:516
Oh! Stop that!

175
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:03,769  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:451 Y2:516
Thinking hurts him! Maybe I can
think of a way to use that.

176
00:16:05,453 --> 00:16:09,810  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:451 Y2:516
Prepare to be thought at!
Leela, give me a topic.

177
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:11,810  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:489 Y2:516
I can't think of anything.

178
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:18,409  X1:208 X2:506 Y1:451 Y2:516
Gotta find something.
<i>Hardy Boys</i>? Too easy.

179
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:20,405  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>Nancy Drew</i>? Too hard.

180
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,605  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:495 Y2:516
Perfect! <i>Bonfire of the Vanities</i>!

181
00:16:23,853 --> 00:16:26,492  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:494 Y2:516
No! It's unbearable!

182
00:16:30,093 --> 00:16:33,529  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:455 Y2:516
They're weakening.
Nibblonians to Nibble stations.

183
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:36,571  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:490 Y2:516
Prepare Cuddle Bug for deployment.

184
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:40,567  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Sometimes I fear we are cute.
- Oh, niggle-snooch.

185
00:16:41,453 --> 00:16:45,571  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:455 Y2:516
Take that! This one I don't
understand. But take this one!

186
00:16:46,813 --> 00:16:48,451  X1:209 X2:505 Y1:490 Y2:516
You have not won yet.

187
00:16:48,693 --> 00:16:52,083  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:456 Y2:516
Each book is a gateway
to a mental realm...

188
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:56,411  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:451 Y2:516
...and I shall take you there
and imprison you forever!

189
00:16:57,453 --> 00:16:58,568  X1:328 X2:388 Y1:490 Y2:516
Icky!

190
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:06,441  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:495 Y2:516
Where are we?

191
00:17:06,773 --> 00:17:10,812  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:451 Y2:516
A gold doubloon to the man
who first spies the white whale.

192
00:17:12,173 --> 00:17:15,404  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Big whale over there.
- I saw it first.

193
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:20,284  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:451 Y2:516
Wait! That no white whale!
It gray thinkie whale!

194
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:22,723  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:490 Y2:516
Let go of me! I have to kill it!

195
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:29,406  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:451 Y2:516
Farewell! You will all be trapped in
this dense symbolist tome forever!

196
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:33,007  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:489 Y2:516
Follow him! It's our only way out!

197
00:17:40,373 --> 00:17:42,568  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:490 Y2:516
Have you seen a giant brain?

198
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,646  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:490 Y2:516
Yep. I let him help with the fence.

199
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:50,842  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:451 Y2:516
Tom Sawyer, you tricked me. This is
less fun than previously indicated.

200
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:55,769  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:451 Y2:516
Let this corny slice of Americana
be your tomb for all eternity.

201
00:17:55,973 --> 00:17:57,201  X1:292 X2:424 Y1:456 Y2:516
- No!
- Come on!

202
00:18:05,813 --> 00:18:08,805  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:451 Y2:516
Mr. Fry? Mama says
you're quite the oddity.

203
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:12,722  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:451 Y2:516
- A bachelor at your age.
- I'm an oddity? Wait till...

204
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:17,643  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:451 Y2:516
The most eligible landowner
in all Hartfordshire, Mr. Brainley.

205
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:19,770  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:489 Y2:516
I'm a gigantic brain!

206
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,328  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:451 Y2:516
- I say!
- Most ungentlemanlike.

207
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:25,525  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:456 Y2:516
What news have you
of the London season?

208
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:27,729  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Well...
- Hey, think fast!

209
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,248  X1:234 X2:481 Y1:490 Y2:516
I always think fast.

210
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:33,132  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:495 Y2:516
The whale! He be white now!

211
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:41,327  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:489 Y2:516
I've got an idea.

212
00:18:41,573 --> 00:18:43,404  X1:188 X2:526 Y1:490 Y2:516
Stay here with Queequeg.

213
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:47,927  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:490 Y2:516
Is there a Mrs. Queequeg?

214
00:18:52,493 --> 00:18:55,087  X1:269 X2:445 Y1:494 Y2:516
Yes! I'm free!

215
00:18:56,293 --> 00:19:00,809  X1:165 X2:549 Y1:456 Y2:516
All right, brain! Get ready for
some electroshock treatment!

216
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:18,447  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:489 Y2:516
Fry, don't die! Wake up!

217
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:22,604  X1:337 X2:379 Y1:495 Y2:516
No!

218
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:32,327  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:450 Y2:516
"Leela cried as Fry lay dead
under the heavy bookcase.

219
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:35,286  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:490 Y2:516
The Big Brain laughed in triumph.

220
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:39,890  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:456 Y2:516
Then, for no reason, he left Earth
forever. The End. " There!

221
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:44,888  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:061 Y2:127
Now he's trapped in my book,
full of plot holes and spelling errors.

222
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:50,611  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:451 Y2:516
The Big Brain am winning again!
I am the "greetest"!

223
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:56,408  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:489 Y2:516
Now I am leaving Earth for no "raisin"!

224
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:04,891  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:454 Y2:516
The Big Brain is defeated.
Let what must be done, be done.

225
00:20:11,573 --> 00:20:17,443  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:451 Y2:516
Me... feel... a bit better
in cognitive faculties.

226
00:20:17,613 --> 00:20:18,648  X1:312 X2:403 Y1:495 Y2:516
I did it!

227
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:23,005  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:450 Y2:516
And it's all thanks to the books
at my local library.

228
00:20:24,253 --> 00:20:26,642  X1:150 X2:561 Y1:492 Y2:516
<i>And so, life returned to normal.</i>

229
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:31,603  X1:123 X2:591 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Or as normal as it gets on this</i>
<i>dirtball inhabited by psychotic apes.</i>

230
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:36,807  X1:128 X2:594 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>The people of Earth had no memory</i>
<i>of what had transpired.</i>

231
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:41,763  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Except Fry. And no one believed him</i>
<i>or cared what he had to say.</i>

232
00:20:43,053 --> 00:20:48,810  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>I returned to my post, ever-vigilant,</i>
<i>lest Earth again come under attack.</i>

233
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:54,610  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>And when that day comes,</i>
<i>God help us. God help us all.</i>

234
00:20:54,813 --> 00:20:57,008  X1:192 X2:522 Y1:490 Y2:516
Time for a diapie change.

235
00:20:57,653 --> 00:20:59,245  X1:242 X2:470 Y1:495 Y2:516
<i>End transmission.</i>
