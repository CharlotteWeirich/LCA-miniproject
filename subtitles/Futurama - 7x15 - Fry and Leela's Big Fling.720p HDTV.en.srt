00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:22,964
Ah, another successful day.

4
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:25,350
Deliveries were made,
nobody got hurt.

5
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,372
Yes, another successful day.

6
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:33,008
Well, see you guys tomorrow!

7
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,777
I'm going home, by myself,

8
00:00:35,845 --> 00:00:37,445
as is normal for me.

9
00:00:37,513 --> 00:00:39,147
Have a good night, Leela!

10
00:00:39,215 --> 00:00:40,849
I won't see you again
until the morning.

11
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,484
- Good-bye. Good-bye now.
- Yeah, see you later, chumps.

12
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:43,685
Okay, everybody,
see you tomorrow.

13
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:46,955
Good night, everyone!

14
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:49,174
Professor, you live here.

15
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:50,425
Where are you going?

16
00:00:50,492 --> 00:00:52,827
I have no idea!

17
00:00:56,465 --> 00:00:58,133
Fry?

18
00:00:58,184 --> 00:00:59,851
Where are you?

19
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,003
Right here, baby.

20
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,056
Uh, could you help me?

21
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:09,110
Ah, alone and unhooked.

22
00:01:09,178 --> 00:01:11,679
Let the evening begin.

23
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:17,235
All right, all right,
where's the surprise?

24
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,687
Almost there.
Keep your eyeball closed.

25
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:27,528
Fry, this is amazing!

26
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,913
You did this all by yourself?

27
00:01:28,998 --> 00:01:30,364
Uh-huh!

28
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,050
All with stuff I found
around the office.

29
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,302
Top Ramen in a Cremora sauce...

30
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:37,088
Xerox-blackened chicken...

31
00:01:37,173 --> 00:01:38,372
Oh, and for dessert,

32
00:01:38,424 --> 00:01:40,759
cherry throat lozenge jubilee.

33
00:01:43,846 --> 00:01:45,379
What a wonderful nighttime
sneezing coughing

34
00:01:45,431 --> 00:01:47,732
stuffy head so-I-can-rest
dessert!

35
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,818
This really is lovely, Fry.

36
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:51,236
Thank you.

37
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:58,660
Uh-huh.

38
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:02,163
Don't pay me no mind.

39
00:02:02,231 --> 00:02:05,917
Oh... Scruffy, could we please
have a little privacy here?

40
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,622
If you can't see me,
is that private?

41
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:14,259
Come on, let's go somewhere
we can be alone.

42
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:20,465
It's so quiet.

43
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:23,134
I'm surprised we're the only
couple out in Central Park.

44
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:25,687
In this remote, unlit area.

45
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:27,639
On Batman's night off. Oh!

46
00:02:27,723 --> 00:02:28,973
This is a stickup!

47
00:02:29,058 --> 00:02:30,692
Oh, hey, Fry and Leela.

48
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,444
Bender?
What are you doing?

49
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:35,363
I'm just out for my
nightly crime spree.

50
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,817
Which reminds me, this is
still a mugging, so...

51
00:02:38,901 --> 00:02:40,652
- Hee-ya!
- Ow!

52
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:42,620
Ow!

53
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:44,939
Help, I'm being mugged!

54
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,718
Mmm. A secluded table,

55
00:02:56,785 --> 00:02:59,637
some big giant ants, and thou.

56
00:03:01,173 --> 00:03:02,524
Ow!

57
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:04,459
Hello!
I'm Dr. Zoidberg.

58
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:06,628
I'll be your busboy tonight...

59
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:07,996
Fry! Leela!

60
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,230
It's me, Zoidberg.

61
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:10,698
From work, and LinkedIn?

62
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:12,500
Mind if I join you?

63
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,853
Very much so.

64
00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:17,805
What with the bad economy
and Hermes never paying me,

65
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:20,441
I got a second job
clearing dishes.

66

No, you're not!

70
00:03:29,118 --> 00:03:30,869
Let's just go to my place.

71
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:41,596
Finally, just the two of us.

00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:44,549

He won't wake up
if we stay quiet.

78
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:03,701
Ooh...

79
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:04,953
Ah!

80
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,571
Nibbler! Scat!

81
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:10,858
Why is it so impossible

82
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,161
for two people to
be completely alone?

83
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,196
<i>Are you and another person</i>

84
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:18,032

<i>to be completely alone?</i>

85
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,250
Now what?

86
00:04:19,335 --> 00:04:20,868
It's targeted advertising.

87
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,253
Can you shut it off?

88
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:23,972
Only if I cut off my arm.

89
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:25,673
I'll get a knife.

90
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,725

That sounds great!

99
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:51,232
Aw, but you can't
possibly afford to

100
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:52,700
take me to a place like that.

101
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,836
<i>Oh, yes, she can.</i>

102
00:04:54,903 --> 00:04:58,172

00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:02,594
This is exactly what we need!

105
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:05,096
Plus, you get a return
visitor discount.

106
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,181
Hey, wait,
you were there before?

107
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:09,183
Um... well...

108
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:10,584
With someone else?

109
00:05:10,636 --> 00:05:11,803
Once.

110
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:13,187
With my old boyfriend Sean.

111
00:05:13,255 --> 00:05:14,856
But look, that's
ancient history,

112
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:16,757
and we need some
one-on-one time.

113
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:18,309
I'm up for it if you are.

114
00:05:18,394 --> 00:05:19,944
I don't know.

115
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:22,113
You'd probably be thinking
of Sean the whole time.

116
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,432
Oh, not the whole time.

117
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,290
Who ordered all
these old-timey cars?

118
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,608
The inhabitants of
Simian 7--

119
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,777
the Planet of the Apes.

120
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:38,212
And monkeys.

121
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,381
And tarsiers,
and several lemurs.

122
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:43,001
All primates, really.

123
00:05:43,085 --> 00:05:44,285
Hey, guys.

124
00:05:44,336 --> 00:05:45,619
We just stopped by to tell you

125
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:46,888
we're taking some
vacation days.

126
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:48,139
No, you're not!

127
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,507
You've got to
go on this delivery!

128
00:05:49,591 --> 00:05:51,392
But we've earned
these days off.

129
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,344
We're not cattle,
we're human beings.

130
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:55,296
You're human beings?

131
00:05:55,347 --> 00:05:57,649
Good Lord, you can't
go on this delivery.

132
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,318
Humans are forbidden on
the Planet of the Primates!

133
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,569
Okay, then.

134
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:02,854
See you in a week!

135
00:06:02,938 --> 00:06:04,489
Buh-bye!

136
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:08,076
Bender, since you're not human,
you can still go.

137
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:10,528
And, Zoidberg,
you can replace Fry.

138
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:11,979
Hooray!

139
00:06:12,031 --> 00:06:14,032
I'm the Fry,
with the cool red jacket

140
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:16,334
and the walking on sunshine!

141
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,253
But we still need someone
to pilot the ship.

142
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:20,672
Amy, what are you?

143
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,340
- Human.
- Damn!

144
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,158
Then you'll need a disguise.

145
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:25,760
Do you have a marmoset costume?

146
00:06:25,827 --> 00:06:27,045
No.

147
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:28,596
Just these marmoset pajamas.

148
00:06:28,663 --> 00:06:30,264
They'll have to do.

149
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:57,909
Man, these hands do everything
but pick your nose.

150
00:07:01,696 --> 00:07:03,131
Wow. Well picked.

151
00:07:03,198 --> 00:07:05,466
I had a nice picking
last time I was here.

152
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:07,034
Come on, let's take a walk.

153
00:07:07,086 --> 00:07:08,803
I'll show you around.

154
00:07:32,778 --> 00:07:35,997
Hey, want to go skinny-dipping
by the light of the fireflies?

155
00:07:36,064 --> 00:07:37,498
Leela!

156
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:39,917
Somebody might see Wingus
and the Ping Pong boys!

157
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,919
No, it's just the two of us.

158
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,237
Come on!

159
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,295
All right,
I'll just keep my top on.

160
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,098
Oh, what the heck.

161
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,439
Well, here we are,
alone and naked.

162
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,940
Want to play Marco Polo?

163
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:04,192
Sure!

164
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,994
- Marco!
- Polo!

165
00:08:07,062 --> 00:08:08,262
Marco!

166
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,814
Polo!

167
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,534
- Sean?
- Leela?

168
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:16,788
- Sean?!
- Polo!

169
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:26,752
What are you doing here, Sean?

170
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:27,986
I was on vacation.

171
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:29,721
Repeat customer discount,

172
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:31,490
free meals 'cause I brought
my own peanut butter.

173
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:33,959
Whole trip cost
less than 600 bucks.

174
00:08:34,027 --> 00:08:37,262
But this is a private resort
for only two people at a time.

175
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,298
Yeah, my week is up,
but the shuttle broke down

176
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:40,799
and they're still
trying to fix it.

177
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,938
But, hey, they gave me two free
drink coupons for my trouble.

178
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:47,639
You want to buy one?

179
00:08:47,707 --> 00:08:48,974
How about you?

180
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:50,676
Sean, I'd like you to meet Fry.

181
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:52,077
He and I are...

182
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:53,645
what would you say we are, Fry?

183
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:55,681
Nude and interrupted.

184
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:56,949
Uh-huh.

185
00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:58,483
Listen, Leela,
I'd love to catch up.

186
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:00,519
What do ya say we split
a free drink at the robo-bar?

187
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:02,254
They've got unlimited pretzels.

188
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:03,689
Put a little peanut
butter on there,

189
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:04,957
they really fill you up.

190
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:07,125
Well, it has been a while.

191
00:09:07,193 --> 00:09:08,660
Is it okay with you, Fry?

192
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:10,428
Sure, that'd be great.

193
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,481
I'll just sit here
and feed the mosquitoes.

194
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:42,144
I'm not sure this marmoset
disguise is working.

195
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:43,645
I'm not sure either.

196
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,348
We'd better ask Amy.

197
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:48,133
Well, that's the last one.

198
00:09:48,184 --> 00:09:50,652
But what does a monkey
financial-services corporation

199
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:52,738
want with a fleet
of classic cars?

200
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:55,490
We don't want the cars,
just the tires!

201
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:58,193
Gentlemen, the new
office chairs are here.

202
00:10:09,872 --> 00:10:11,206
Sign here, please.

203
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,343
I'll just use
my opposable thumb.

204
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:17,929
You know, normally I don't
go for New World monkeys,

205
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:20,899
but I am digging
your upright posture.

206
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:23,902
Geez, Edwards, hitting on
a delivery marmoset?

207
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,855
Why don't you just show
her your big blue ass?

208
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:29,174
Oh, I'm getting to that.

209
00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:33,178
Call me.

210
00:10:33,229 --> 00:10:35,280
Oh, my gosh. Amy?

211
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:37,065
- Amy Wong?
- Guenter?

212
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,017
From Mars University?

213
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:40,702
How have you been?

214
00:10:40,787 --> 00:10:42,020
Ah, pretty good.

215
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:43,455
Working in financial services,

216
00:10:43,522 --> 00:10:45,357
you really get
to help rich people

217
00:10:45,408 --> 00:10:47,376
realize their expensive dreams.

218
00:10:48,694 --> 00:10:50,295
Nice disguise, by the way.

219
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:52,297
I won't say anything.

220
00:10:57,503 --> 00:11:00,372
After that, my music career
really started taking off.

221
00:11:00,423 --> 00:11:02,474
I recorded a demo
and shot a video,

222
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,042
but then I lost my phone.

223
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:06,228
My life has been
equally exciting.

224
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:09,648
It turned out, I'm not
an alien orphan, I'm a mutant.

225
00:11:09,715 --> 00:11:11,450
With wonderful parents.

226
00:11:11,517 --> 00:11:14,052
Yeah, we've been through
a lot, me and my sax.

227
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,455
May I noodle?

228
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:18,690
Please.
It's been a long time.

229
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:36,425
Look at them.

230
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:38,743
I came here to get romantic
with the woman I love.

231
00:11:38,795 --> 00:11:41,129
Instead, she's with her
ex-boyfriend and I'm stuck with

232
00:11:41,214 --> 00:11:43,131
a pair of skilled
mechanical hands.

233
00:11:45,017 --> 00:11:47,686
Say, I don't suppose
you're free later?

234
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:51,606
Then I have no choice.

235
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:53,608
And now this part.

236
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:02,100
If you want to steal my girl,
you'll have to fight me for her.

237
00:12:02,151 --> 00:12:04,769
Stop playing that lovely song
and put up your dukes!

238
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:08,373
Fry, there's nothing
to be jealous of.

239
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:10,942
I've been sitting here
paying my bills online.

240
00:12:13,612 --> 00:12:15,664
Dude, you broke my reed!

241
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:17,048
You owe me, like, a dollar!

242
00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:19,617
You'll have to kill me for it!

243
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:20,785
Hi-yah!

244
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:24,122
Just stop, you two!

245
00:12:24,173 --> 00:12:25,974
I've had that reed
for 20 years!

246
00:12:26,058 --> 00:12:27,793
It's irreplaceable!

247
00:12:29,178 --> 00:12:30,312
I want my dollar!

248
00:12:30,396 --> 00:12:31,680
Sean?

249
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:33,498
What the heck are you doing,
you moron?

250
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:35,167
A little drinking,
a little fighting.

251
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:36,468
Get off my back.

252
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:37,536
Who are you?

253
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:38,820
This is my wife, Darlene.

254
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:40,489
We met at the
99-cent store.

255
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:41,690
You're married?!

256
00:12:41,774 --> 00:12:43,575
Wait a dang minute.

257
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:46,644
One eye, purple hair--
you're Leela!

258
00:12:46,696 --> 00:12:48,413
The crazy one that Sean dumped.

259
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:49,981
It was mutual!

260
00:12:50,032 --> 00:12:52,584
Sean, why is this hussy
at our resort?

261
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:55,370
Your resort?
This is <i>our</i> vacation.

262
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:57,088
- Could've fooled me.
- Quiet, Fry.

263
00:12:57,156 --> 00:12:59,424
This is between me and the
lady in the hooter hammock.

264
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:00,926
Listen, honey,

265
00:13:00,993 --> 00:13:02,827
I'd love to stay here
and Denny's-fight you,

266
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,546
but they just told me
the shuttle's fixed.

267
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,931
What?!
We better leave

268
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:07,499
before they charge
us for another day.

269
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,768
Grab some complimentary
snacks and let's go!

270
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,893
I'm drunk, I'm grouchy, and I'm
gonna eat this peanut butter.

271
00:13:17,977 --> 00:13:19,444
Want to watch?

272
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:21,229
Not really, but I will.

273
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:23,231
Fine.

274
00:13:38,197 --> 00:13:41,216
This is Christopher Colobus,
the brave monkey

275
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,052
who led a band of genetically
engineered primates from Earth

276
00:13:44,136 --> 00:13:46,037
to colonize our planet.

277
00:13:46,088 --> 00:13:47,872
Wait, if you guys
came from Earth,

278
00:13:47,924 --> 00:13:49,474
why do you hate humans so much?

279
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:51,059
Oh, please.

280
00:13:51,143 --> 00:13:54,045
Humans experimented on us,
chained us to organ-grinders,

281
00:13:54,096 --> 00:13:57,315
made us ride around
in ridiculous tiny vehicles.

282
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:02,604
You're still riding around
in ridiculous tiny vehicles.

283
00:14:02,688 --> 00:14:03,772
By choice.

284
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:05,657
Come on, let's grab some lunch.

285
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:12,247
It's all-you-can-eat, so just
pick off whatever looks good.

286
00:14:12,331 --> 00:14:15,233
Ew, gross!

287
00:14:15,284 --> 00:14:17,235
I'm gonna use the tongs.

288
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:24,342
We have our own
literature, music and art.

289
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,178
The smear lines are impeccable.

290
00:14:29,465 --> 00:14:31,633
Unlike your Earth zoos,

291
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:34,252
our zoo is a model of
compassionate encagement.

292
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:36,605
The animals don't even
know they're in captivity.

293
00:14:40,643 --> 00:14:41,810
See?

294
00:14:46,482 --> 00:14:48,149
Um...

295
00:14:48,234 --> 00:14:49,484
Leela?

296
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:51,119
I'm sorry I ruined
our vacation.

297
00:14:52,204 --> 00:14:53,605
It's not your fault.

298
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:55,490
I wanted this week
to be special.

299
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:57,626
And then Sean had to show up.

300
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,794
Do you still have
feelings for him?

301
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,613
No.

302
00:15:01,664 --> 00:15:05,000
I mean, I'll always respect
his frugality, but that's all.

303
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:09,004
Well, the important thing
is, we're finally alone.

304
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,888
_

305
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:29,341
Oh, your God!

306
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:31,476
Fry and Leela are in a zoo!

307
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:32,694
Shh!

308
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:34,079
Oh, sorry. _

309
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:38,629
Wow.

310
00:15:38,697 --> 00:15:40,064
Those fireflies are going nuts.

311
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:41,465
Come here.

312
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:43,768
I've always wanted
to make love by bug-light.

313
00:15:44,836 --> 00:15:46,504
Shmoly crap!

314
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,956
We've got to get Fry and Leela
out of this habitat

315
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,925
before they humiliate
themselves.

316
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:54,578
Please, Amy, the act of love
is a beautiful and natural...

317
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:56,797
Oh, my God, cover your eyes!

318
00:15:56,882 --> 00:15:59,416
Come on, we'd better
talk to the zoo director.

319
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:07,775
Mr. Zoo Director,
we don't know you

320
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:09,443
and you're facing away from us,

321
00:16:09,528 --> 00:16:11,428
but you have our friends
caged up and...

322
00:16:12,481 --> 00:16:13,531
Dr. Banjo?!

323
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,933
The same.

324
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:17,284
Hang on.

325
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:18,602
Coming around.

326
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:20,371
There.

327
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,157
Why, if it isn't Professor
Farnsworth's friends.

328
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:25,459
Zoidberg, Bender and...

329
00:16:25,544 --> 00:16:28,128
Who is this fetching
young marmoset?

330
00:16:28,213 --> 00:16:30,514
Uh... Sparkles?

331
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:32,349
Enough zoo director talk.

332
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:34,652
We know those guys,
and we want them freed.

333
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:37,221
Ah, yes, our
famous Human Habitat.

334
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,974
This pair have been
our most popular specimens yet.

335
00:16:40,058 --> 00:16:41,675
Especially the male.

336
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,345
I've never seen one have
so much trouble with zippers.

337
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:47,398
As fun as it is to watch Fry
try and operate his pants,

338
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,034
you can't keep him and Leela
here against their will.

339
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:51,535
Against their will?

340
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:54,238
My good robot,
they paid to be here.

341
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,173
They think they're on
a romantic holiday.

342
00:16:56,241 --> 00:17:00,044
Humans have been vacationing
in our habitat for years.

343
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:02,346
In fact,
Leela's been here before.

344
00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:04,582
When her previous mate, Sean,

345
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,650
returned here
with his current female,

346
00:17:06,718 --> 00:17:10,020
we quickly invited Leela back
as a behavioral experiment,

347
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:11,555
keeping the first pair here

348
00:17:11,623 --> 00:17:14,491
under the pretext
of shuttle repairs.

349
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,177
The human exhibit
has never been so popular,

350
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:19,213
all thanks to your friends.

351
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:20,548
Well, that's that.

352
00:17:20,632 --> 00:17:22,049
What do you want to see next?

353
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:23,384
We have a great maritime museum.

354
00:17:23,468 --> 00:17:24,885
Shut up, Guenter!

355
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,354
You can't just put people
on display.

356
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,439
It's cruel.

357
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,506
Cruel?

358
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:30,841
Was it cruel when humans caged

359
00:17:30,892 --> 00:17:32,860
other primates in zoos
for centuries?

360
00:17:32,944 --> 00:17:35,062
Wait, I know the
answer to this one.

361
00:17:35,146 --> 00:17:36,447
Yes.

362
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,016
Look, we're all agreed
humans are idiots.

363
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:40,701
But these idiots
are our friends.

364
00:17:40,785 --> 00:17:42,236
Friends, eh?

365
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,071
Perhaps you wouldn't be
so worried about them

366
00:17:44,155 --> 00:17:46,356
if you knew what they really
thought of you.

367
00:17:46,408 --> 00:17:48,859
It's so great
being away from everyone.

368
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,245
Zoidberg and his awful stench.

369
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:52,696
Stanky.

370
00:17:52,747 --> 00:17:54,748
Bender and his obnoxious ego.

371
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,216
But-but...

372
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:57,885
And what about Amy?

373
00:17:57,969 --> 00:18:01,138
Always prancing around in those
stupid marmoset pajamas.

374
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,139
Hey!

375
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,757
You know who I hate most?

376
00:18:03,842 --> 00:18:05,542
That monkey
we haven't seen in years.

377
00:18:05,594 --> 00:18:06,927
Guenter.

378
00:18:07,979 --> 00:18:09,713
You see?

379
00:18:09,764 --> 00:18:12,483
Observing animals yields
critical scientific data.

380
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,734
For example,

381
00:18:13,818 --> 00:18:15,986
that you, Sparkles
the marmoset,

382
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,105
are in fact Sparkles the human!

383
00:18:19,991 --> 00:18:23,243
Wild human!
Wild human!

384
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,229
Dr. Banjo,
surely we can

385
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:28,832
discuss this like
recently civilized beings.

386
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,838
Cheese it!

387
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,790
Whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop.

388
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,413
Hurry!

389
00:18:43,465 --> 00:18:45,132
We still have to rescue
Fry and Leela!

390
00:18:45,216 --> 00:18:47,417
Even if my stupid
marmoset pajamas

391
00:18:47,469 --> 00:18:49,269
offend Leela's big fat eye.

392
00:18:49,354 --> 00:18:52,189
After they said
I had an obnoxious ego?

393
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,274
Me, the magnificent Bender?

394
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,777
Back!

395
00:18:56,861 --> 00:18:58,195
Back, you beasts!

396
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,363
Follow me.

397
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,764
The one who stinks,

398
00:19:00,815 --> 00:19:02,483
according to Fry's
delicate nose.

399
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,202
_

400
00:19:07,822 --> 00:19:09,039
This way.
We can get in

401
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,324
through the back
of the human cage and...

402
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,378
Prairie elephant!

403
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,380
Adorable prairie elephant!

404
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,504
Whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop.

405
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,567
Okay, let's just get in,
get out and...

406
00:19:40,271 --> 00:19:42,189
Now what?

407
00:19:42,273 --> 00:19:44,992
Now we wait for nature
to take its course.

408
00:19:45,076 --> 00:19:47,695
How long does it take
to pass through a moon worm?

409
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,944
_

410
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,368
All right, let's just rescue
them and get out of here.

411
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:05,379
Hooray, they're saved!

412
00:20:12,437 --> 00:20:15,272
And the robot hands would make
you a strawberry shortcake

413
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,724
any time of day.

414
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:19,226
4:00, 7:00, any time.

415
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,527
No way!

416
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:21,562
I'm not lying.

417
00:20:21,646 --> 00:20:23,030
Also, Leela and I...

418
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:26,349
Had a very nice, very
private vacation.

419
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:28,619
Let's just leave it at that.

420
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,020
Oh, can I tell them?

421
00:20:30,088 --> 00:20:31,021
Please, please?

422
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:32,256
I got to tell them.

423
00:20:32,323 --> 00:20:34,358
No. You'll only
make them feel bad.

424
00:20:34,426 --> 00:20:36,126
Let's not humiliate them.

425
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:37,861
Listen to Sparkles.

426
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:39,363
Oh, no.

427
00:20:39,431 --> 00:20:41,331
What happened to
your marmoset pajamas, Amy?

428
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:45,903
Fry and I were just talking
about how <i>adorable</i> those are.

429
00:20:47,422 --> 00:20:49,556
Also, nothing in here
smells like a rotting crab.

430
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:52,893
Now can I?
Now can I?

431
00:20:52,977 --> 00:20:55,045
Let 'er rip.

432
00:20:55,096 --> 00:20:57,314
