00:00:18,592 --> 00:00:22,148
<i>And now "The transcredible
exploits of Zapp Brannigan"

3
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,932
<i>brought to you by
Bartley's rocket wax.

4
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,460
I wax my rocket every day!

5
00:00:32,495 --> 00:00:34,941
No one can save you
now, Leela.

6
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:36,909
What about Zapp Brannigan?

7
00:00:36,977 --> 00:00:40,213
Well, obviously, Zapp Brannigan
could save you, but...

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,647
Zapp Brannigan?!

9
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:44,851
So, Emperor Chopchop,
once again, we meet at last.

10
00:00:44,918 --> 00:00:47,854
Drop that space gun
or I'll shoot... like so.

11
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:49,722
Ooh.

12
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,024
Oh! Oh, Zapp.

13
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:54,093
Tie me back up
and ravish me.

14
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:56,529
I'd like to,
Leela, so I will.

15
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:05,304
Mmm, shake it, baby.

16
00:01:05,372 --> 00:01:06,539
Shake it like...

17
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:08,741
I surrender and
volunteer for treason.

18
00:01:08,809 --> 00:01:11,310
Emergency summons
from the president, Captain.

19
00:01:11,378 --> 00:01:12,678
Oh, it's you.

20
00:01:12,746 --> 00:01:13,880
Just let me freshen up.

21
00:01:13,947 --> 00:01:16,449
Computer, Captain's musk.

22
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:36,936
The long, dramatic corridor.

23
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:38,971
That's never a good sign.

24
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,175
Glove recognized.

25
00:01:42,242 --> 00:01:45,344
Proceed, Mrs. Eisenhower.

26
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,381
Mr. President.
What the hell?

27
00:01:48,448 --> 00:01:50,049
At ease, Brannigan.

28
00:01:51,518 --> 00:01:54,453
What you're about to see
is highly classified.

29
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:55,688
Reptilicus,

30
00:01:55,756 --> 00:01:57,390
hit the thingy.

31
00:01:59,226 --> 00:02:00,927
At oh-zero-hundred hours,

32
00:02:00,994 --> 00:02:04,730
planet X-3 was attacked by
a mysterious death-sphere.

33
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:07,033
Magnify that death-sphere.

34
00:02:08,302 --> 00:02:10,203
Why is it still blurry?

35
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,405
That's all the
resolution we have.

36
00:02:12,472 --> 00:02:14,674
Making it bigger
doesn't make it clearer.

37
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:15,975
It does on CSI: Miami.

38
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:20,479
They fought back with
advanced military hardware,

39
00:02:20,547 --> 00:02:25,051
but it was like shooting
bbs at Bebe Rebozo.

40
00:02:25,118 --> 00:02:27,253
That poor, brave hardware.

41
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:30,690
The sphere then fired some
kind of hellish blackout ray.

42
00:02:30,757 --> 00:02:35,861
Erased that planet like 18
minutes of incriminating tape.

43
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:41,167
Oh, I just wish
I understood why.

44
00:02:41,235 --> 00:02:42,635
Why I should care.

45
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:45,605
Because the death-sphere
is now on course for Earth.

46
00:02:45,672 --> 00:02:48,874
Aroo!

47
00:02:48,942 --> 00:02:52,211
My God, we're defenseless,
like fish in a barrel.

48
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:53,346
Options?

49
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:54,981
My instinct is
to hide in this barrel

50
00:02:55,048 --> 00:02:56,482
like the wily fish.

51
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,618
Ah, then we're down
to our last hope:

52
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:02,221
A radical new weapon built
by a visionary scientist

53
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:04,824
I once dismissed as crazy.

54
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:10,896
Let's see how crazy
I am now, Nixon.

55
00:03:10,964 --> 00:03:13,266
The correct answer is "very."

56
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,967
All right, Professor,

57
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:16,369
sock it to me.

58
00:03:16,436 --> 00:03:18,004
Top secret news, everyone.

59
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:20,940
I've developed a tiny,
one-man stealth fighter

60
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:23,409
that's virtually undetectable.

61
00:03:23,477 --> 00:03:24,877
How undetectable?

62
00:03:24,945 --> 00:03:26,345
It's right in front of you.

63
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:27,480
I find that...

64
00:03:27,547 --> 00:03:29,081
Ow! ...To believe.

65
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:32,518
Hubba, hubba.

66
00:03:32,586 --> 00:03:34,553
But how exactly is this
happy meal toy going

67
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:36,756
to destroy a giant
death-sphere?

68
00:03:36,823 --> 00:03:38,090
From within.

69
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:40,159
This ship should be able
to sneak, undetected,

70
00:03:40,227 --> 00:03:43,129
through the sphere's
one vulnerable opening.

71
00:03:43,196 --> 00:03:44,597
What vulnerable opening?

72
00:03:44,665 --> 00:03:47,366
All death-spheres have
one vulnerable opening.

73
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:50,002
Well, sure, but who's brave
enough to fly into something

74
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,338
we all keep calling
a death-sphere?

75
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:54,340
I say Brannigan.
I say no.

76
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:56,542
- I say me.
- I say Leela.

77
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,744
- I say yes.
- I say no.

78
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:00,112
I say Leela, too.

79
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,414
I say yes again.

80
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:02,948
I say I shall join her.

81
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:04,850
But it's only a one-man craft.

82
00:04:04,918 --> 00:04:05,985
I say.

83
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:08,888
There'll only be
one man... Me.

84
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:10,823
How would you feel
if I rode rear

85
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:13,259
as your personal
tail gunner?

86
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:14,527
Creeped out.

87
00:04:14,594 --> 00:04:15,961
Then it's decided.

88
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:18,698
Cape Knievel
Flight Test Center

89
00:04:21,034 --> 00:04:23,703
Are you sure I have
to sit in your lap?

90
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,405
It'll help us achieve
maximum thrust.

91
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,076
I made you some trail mix
for the flight.

92
00:04:30,143 --> 00:04:32,578
Also, this picture,
to remember me.

93
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:34,213
You hold onto it.

94
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:36,248
I'll be back soon.

95
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:39,385
Aah!

96
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:41,253
Activating stealth shielding.

97
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:46,425
Liftoff!

98
00:04:46,493 --> 00:04:47,560
I'll Roger that.

99
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,601
Does anybody else feel aroused
and jealous and worried?

100
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:57,503
I haven't felt
much of anything

101
00:04:57,571 --> 00:05:00,272
since my Guinea pig died.

102
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:10,249
Death-sphere in range.

103
00:05:10,317 --> 00:05:13,252
Engaging holographic targeting.

104
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,654
Activating the force.

105
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:19,024
Male voice
Feel the entrance, Leela.

106
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:24,029
Destination on your left
in 0.3 miles.

107
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:29,635
Zapp to Leela.

108
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:31,871
Look at all that
surveillance equipment.

109
00:05:31,938 --> 00:05:33,205
We better whisper.

110
00:05:33,273 --> 00:05:35,841
Switching to pillow talk mode.

111
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:38,577
Look! What are
those huge letters?

112
00:05:38,645 --> 00:05:41,514
V-giny?

113
00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:43,082
Doesn't ring a bell.

114
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,186
Hmm, I don't like
the looks of this V-giny.

115
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:50,523
Does anyone recognize
those call letters?

116
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,024
Nope.

117
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:54,126
It's not in the
janeway's guide either.

118
00:05:54,194 --> 00:05:56,562
Deciphering that I.D. Code
is critical.

119
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,799
I'll be in the chamber
of understanding.

120
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:11,143
This is it... the moment we
should have trained for.

121
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:28,494
Holy cr...

122
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:32,331
Incoming yucky.
Firing pocket-rocket!

123
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:39,405
Don't panic, Leela.
Go, go, go, go, go.

124
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,647
I hope this is
the control stick.

125
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:55,855
Captain's log.

126
00:06:55,922 --> 00:06:57,890
We've lost control.
Addendum...

127
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:09,994
Chapter two:
"The heat thickens."

128
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,430
Leela, wake up.

129
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,732
I can't face this
mysterious planet alone

130
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,668
without you
or someone like you.

131
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:20,572
Zapp?
Zapp, wake up.

132
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,175
Leela, where are we?

133
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,377
We crashed
on an uncharted planet.

134
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:29,080
When I woke up,
I was pinned under this tree.

135
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,248
Can you help me?

136
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,750
If anyone can
move it, I can.

137
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,120
No one can move it.

138
00:07:36,188 --> 00:07:37,322
Are you hurt?

139
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:39,657
No, but I'm so thirsty.

140
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,360
This space suit is making me
sweat like a sow.

141
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,262
Me, too.
We'd better strip them off

142
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,098
and continue surviving
au naturel.

143
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,335
Uh... I suppose so.

144
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,339
Here, we can
cover ourselves

145
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:56,808
with these sticky,
sap-covered leaves.

146
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,410
I'll try to avert my eyes
from your nudery.

147
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:00,612
You will?

148
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:01,846
Eh, what's the point?

149
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,481
You'll have to look
sooner or later.

150
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,484
Well, I promise
not to abuse the privilege.

151
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:07,752
For now I'd better
scout ound

152
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,554
for food and
water and help.

153
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,323
What a thoughtful
and considerate thing to say.

154
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,958
What the hell's wrong with you?

155
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,460
I'm not quite sure.

156
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:18,663
Perhaps it's the fresh air
or a severe head injury.

157
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,798
In any case, I'm off.

158
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:24,302
If you see any steaks,
that'd be good!

159
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:27,672
Why isn't Leela back yet?

160
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,007
Do you think she's okay?

161
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,208
How should I know?

162
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,377
And how come you
never ask if I'm okay?

163
00:08:32,444 --> 00:08:34,312
I'm feeling
a little neglected here.

164
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,581
Oh, sorry.
Are you okay, Bender?

165
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:37,715
Shut up.

166
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:38,950
What difference
does it make?

167
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,351
When that death-sphere
gets here,

168
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,587
we'll all be blown
to manwich meat.

169
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,689
Well, I guess
it's time to indulge

170
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,925
in some end-of-the-world
debauchery.

171
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:49,093
Who's up for an orgy?

172
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,365
Maybe a parcheesi
tournament.

173
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,367
Belay that parcheesi tournament.

174
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:59,070
I've identified
the death-sphere.

175
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,473
We may yet have
a faint hope of survival.

176
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,310
Still, a parcheesi tournament.

177
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:09,280
This is a top secret
military satellite

178
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:12,216
launched by the
air force in 1998.

179
00:09:12,284 --> 00:09:16,054
And this is a top
secret FCC  satellite

180
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:17,855
launched that same year

181
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:20,325
to censor indecent
TV programs.

182
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:22,827
Like The Pimpsons
and Ass-o-rama?

183
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,228
Precisely.

184
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:26,798
However, the satellites collided
shortly after launch

185
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:29,000
and were never heard from again.

186
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,368
I found the board!

187
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,136
Now I've simulated
that collision

188
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,205
using shrapnel-vision.

189
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:41,346
V-giny!

190
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:43,281
Granted, all that makes
perfect sense.

191
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,017
But why is this death-sphere
destroying planets?

192
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,186
That makes
the most sense of all.

193
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:50,989
Lookt the planets
it's destroyed so far.

194
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:55,059
First came X-3 the
nude beach planet,

195
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,228
then Poopiter,

196
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,797
and finally that world
that can't be mentioned

197
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,799
in polite company.

198
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,134
You mean...

199
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,702
How dare you.

200
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,871
So the death-sphere

201
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,907
is "censoring"
indecent planets?

202
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:11,376
Indeed, and we're next,

203
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:14,045
if we can't keep it in
our collective pants.

204
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,148
Our sole hope is to persuade
the people of earth

205
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,550
to abandon their
smutty ways.

206
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:23,221
So the orgy's off?

207
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,890
So thirsty.

208
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,327
Why couldn't a water fountain
have fallen on me?

209
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,362
I couldn't find any
water, but the moisture

210
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,132
in these fruit-nut-berries
should sustain you.

211
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:36,167
Thank you.

212
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:39,070
I climbed perilously high
into the trees to pick them,

213
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,140
yet I saw no sign
of intelligent life.

214
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:43,341
Bummer.

215
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,542
Moreover, the crash

216
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,511
totally destroyed our ship.

217
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:48,913
So we're stuck here
until someone finds us?

218
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,715
Alas, that may
never happen.

219
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,651
Stealth technology makes the
ship impossible to locate,

220
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,853
yet easy to stub
your crotch on.

221
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,723
Well, there's worse places
to be marooned.

222
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,992
Plenty of food, mild climate.

223
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,795
I's a veritable garden of eden.

224
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:05,730
It is?

225
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:12,203
Hello.

226
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,571
Did that snake say hello?

227
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,307
No. We're both delirious
from dehydration.

228
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,876
Just like
Adam and Eve.

229
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:25,283
We can still save Earth.

230
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,485
People are sure
to clean up their act

231
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,687
when presented
with cold, hard facts

232
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,023
by rational folks like us.

233
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,759
The end is near!

234
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,794
Repent thy sins!

235
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,129
I'll thinks it overs

236
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,598
while I engages
is five-dollar hooker.

237
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,900
Don't do it!
It's not worth it!

238
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,602
Okay, make it three dollars.

239
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,872
Yuck! I don't wants
no three-dollar hooker.

240
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,942
I'm going backs
to the adults bookstore.

241
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:52,176
Adult bookstore?

242
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,945
I thought this was
the public library.

243
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:56,747
No. Pubic library.

244
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:59,250
Zapp? Where are you?

245
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,453
Oh, God, I'm actually
starting to miss him.

246
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,789
Maybe you two
belong together.

247
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,191
We do not.
And you can't talk.

248
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,259
Oh, come on.

249
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,828
It must be
an awful temptation.

250
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,731
Guess who just killed a
woodchuck with his bare feet?

251
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,802
I thought I'd whip
us up some shelter.

252
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,604
Make this a little
more like home.

253
00:12:19,671 --> 00:12:21,506
I do miss
the Earth terribly.

254
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:23,908
I wonder if it's
even still there?

255
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,943
Let's find out together.
I'll brave

256
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:29,280
the ship's wreckage to
fetch you the telescope.

257
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,015
That's so sweet.

258
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,284
I'm just sayin', is all.

259
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,765
I know my new plan
is a long shot,

260
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,867
but it's the
only hope left.

261
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,236
Well, now
I've heard everything.

262
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,471
On my iPod.

263
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,006
So, do you have a new plan,
Professor?

264
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:56,641
And is there any hope left?

265
00:12:56,708 --> 00:13:00,778
Indeed. We're here on
Earth's last unspoiled acre

266
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,113
to show the death-sphere

267
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,515
there's still purity
in the world.

268
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,317
Begin transmitting.

269
00:13:07,986 --> 00:13:10,221
Commence purity chant.

270
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,962
Hey, I'm proud of you, Bender...

271
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,864
avoiding sin
for almost a full minute.

272
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,265
Bender?

273
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,669
Oh yeah, baby,
you're quite a dish.

274
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:28,172
Oh, yeah.

275
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,341
Oh, no. Oh, yeah.
Ooh!

276
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,877
- Oh, no.
- Bender, stop!

277
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,111
Stop!

278
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:35,580
Eh, quiet your riot.

279
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:39,450
What's the worst
that could happen?

280
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:50,895
No... no!

281
00:13:52,764 --> 00:13:54,198
Earth is gone!

282
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:57,568
We're the only two humans
left in the universe!

283
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,939
Oh, God, I'm sorry, Leela.

284
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,276
Maybe... maybe
this was meant to be.

285
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,646
Maybe you and I were meant
to build a new world here.

286
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,881
We can avoid
humanity's mistakes.

287
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:12,049
Like the tuba.

288
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,251
Yes!

289
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:14,819
We'll be like
Adam and Eve.

290
00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:16,120
Only without the tuba.

291
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,955
And we'll beget
little Zapp junior.

292
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,223
And Leela junior.

293
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,125
And they'll have kids
of their own.

294
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,894
Yuck! Is that really
what happened in the Bible?

295
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:26,864
It's a sick and twisted book
of holiness, all right.

296
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,532
Then we'll write our own Bible.

297
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,569
With less Sodom
and more Gomorrah.

298
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:32,837
Let's do it.

299
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:35,239
I shall become the
mother of a new world,

300
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,108
trapped here,
under this tree.

301
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:38,809
The tree of knowledge.

302
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:41,078
Look, it even has apples!

303
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,681
Ow! Wow!

304
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,684
Come here, Adam.

305
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,186
Partake of my
forbidden fruit.

306
00:14:49,254 --> 00:14:51,289
Thee will be done.

307
00:14:58,471 --> 00:15:02,107
Wait. One more bite
before we begin the begetting.

308
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:05,310
Mmm. Juicy.

309
00:15:05,378 --> 00:15:07,479
Those nut-berries
you found were so salty,

310
00:15:07,547 --> 00:15:09,681
I couldn't think straight.

311
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,686
I mean, not to belabor it,
but they were as salty

312
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:17,322
as that bag of trail mix
Fry gave me.

313
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,357
Exactly as salty.

314
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:21,760
Hey! Wait a second!

315
00:15:21,828 --> 00:15:23,195
Uh...

316
00:15:23,262 --> 00:15:25,530
Oh...

317
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:31,036
I have a terrible
confession to make.

318
00:15:31,103 --> 00:15:34,272
You see, when I first
went foraging,

319
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,740
what I actually found

320
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:37,876
was the smoldering wreckage
of the ship.

321
00:15:37,944 --> 00:15:39,878
Ignoring all danger, I charged

322
00:15:39,946 --> 00:15:42,814
inside to liberate
our provisions.

323
00:15:42,882 --> 00:15:45,183
So this is the trail mix
Fry gave me!

324
00:15:45,251 --> 00:15:49,621
Yes. I exaggerated when I said
I picked it from the treetops.

325
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:51,389
I just wanted
you to think...

326
00:15:51,457 --> 00:15:54,125
A little better of me.

327
00:15:54,193 --> 00:15:56,695
Well... your motives were good.

328
00:15:56,762 --> 00:15:59,798
And we were both loopy
from dehydration.

329
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:01,233
Hey, wait.

330
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,468
You've been doing
an awful lot of urinating.

331
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:06,972
There's plenty of water.

332
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,773
You see,

333
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:10,942
after I selflessly rescued
the trail mix,

334
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,479
i braved the flames once more,
in search of fluids.

335
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:22,487
Then why didn't you give me any?

336
00:16:23,823 --> 00:16:25,457
I thought it might
help you forget

337
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:28,860
your intense hatred for me if
you were a teensy bit delirious.

338
00:16:28,928 --> 00:16:30,996
So you let me dehydrate

339
00:16:31,063 --> 00:16:32,764
while you washed down
the trail mix

340
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:34,666
with imported mineral water?

341
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:37,636
Not exactly.

342
00:16:37,703 --> 00:16:39,538
You see, besides the trail mix,

343
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:42,207
the minibar also contained
doritos, beef jerky,

344
00:16:42,275 --> 00:16:45,310
and a generous assortment
of fine chocolates.

345
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,413
I wanted to offer you
the chocolates...

346
00:16:48,481 --> 00:16:52,117
I truly did... but I was
concerned about your waistline.

347
00:16:52,184 --> 00:16:53,418
Very concerned.

348
00:16:53,486 --> 00:16:55,453
It's because
I haven't been exercising.

349
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:58,924
If only this tree hadn't
fallen on me by chance.

350
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:01,192
Oh, dear God!

351
00:17:04,964 --> 00:17:07,098
It was just after we crashed.

352
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,701
I awoke first,
to find you trapped.

353
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:11,169
Leela!

354
00:17:11,237 --> 00:17:13,305
Leela, wake up.

355
00:17:25,618 --> 00:17:28,119
You could've moved this
grub-infested log

356
00:17:28,187 --> 00:17:29,588
any time you wanted?

357
00:17:29,655 --> 00:17:31,289
Well, sure...

358
00:17:31,357 --> 00:17:34,025
But then I wouldn't have been
able to provide the loving care

359
00:17:34,093 --> 00:17:35,827
you wouldn't have needed.

360
00:17:38,297 --> 00:17:40,532
I'd leave you to rot
in this paradise,

361
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,434
if only the ship
weren't destroyed.

362
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:45,704
The ship's fully
functional, isn't it?

363
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:50,342
You see, after re-trapping you

364
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:52,410
and before feigning
unconsciousness,

365
00:17:52,478 --> 00:17:54,012
i paused to enjoy a cigar.

366
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,315
Though mellow and satisfying,
it did parch me a bit,

367
00:17:57,383 --> 00:17:59,084
so I went in search of Brandy.

368
00:17:59,151 --> 00:18:01,219
That's when my keen
senses detected

369
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:03,455
the still-invisible ship.

370
00:18:03,522 --> 00:18:04,923
Ow!

371
00:18:06,325 --> 00:18:08,226
So we can go back to Earth?

372
00:18:08,294 --> 00:18:11,329
But there is no
Earth anymore!

373
00:18:11,397 --> 00:18:12,964
Everyone I know is dead!

374
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:17,502
Ah, this seems like a good
place to take a dump.

375
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,605
Leela?! You're alive!

376
00:18:20,673 --> 00:18:22,340
Fry!

377
00:18:22,408 --> 00:18:25,577
But how did you
find this planet?

378
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:27,312
Well?

379
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:31,049
We're actually on Earth.

380
00:18:31,117 --> 00:18:33,118
The ship's homing device
brought us back.

381
00:18:33,185 --> 00:18:34,953
But I saw Earth explode.

382
00:18:35,021 --> 00:18:38,156
I'm actually kind of proud
of this one.

383
00:18:38,224 --> 00:18:39,658
You see, what you saw

384
00:18:39,725 --> 00:18:42,127
was merely a simulation
I rigged up,

385
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:44,996
using the ship's holographic
targeting projector.

386
00:18:45,064 --> 00:18:48,233
The alleged "telescope"
was a toilet paper tube.

387
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,835
You said there wasn't
any toilet paper!

388
00:18:50,903 --> 00:18:53,038
And that humanity was
annihilated!

389
00:18:53,105 --> 00:18:54,572
My motives were pure.

390
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,175
I just wanted to you to think
we had to save humanity

391
00:18:57,243 --> 00:18:58,777
so you'd be willing
to have sex.

392
00:18:58,844 --> 00:19:00,512
Please say you believe me.

393
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:02,847
Yes, I believe you.

394
00:19:02,915 --> 00:19:04,249
Hee-ya!

395
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:07,519
Yay!

396
00:19:07,586 --> 00:19:10,522
There must be something to
steal on this island.

397
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:11,890
Hey, it's Leela.

398
00:19:13,626 --> 00:19:15,226
Let's go home, everybody.

399
00:19:15,294 --> 00:19:17,328
At least the world
wasn't destroyed.

400
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:20,198
Yet.

401
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:25,303
People of Earth!

402
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:28,840
Hear the righteous word
of the mighty V-giny!

403
00:19:28,908 --> 00:19:30,575
The mighty V-giny!

404
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,711
Seeing you frolic

405
00:19:32,778 --> 00:19:34,979
in this unspoiled garden

406
00:19:35,047 --> 00:19:38,016
gives hope that this world
may yet be redeemed.

407
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:41,820
Huzzah!
The purity chant worked!

408
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:44,956
Unacceptable wardrobe
malfunction!

409
00:19:45,024 --> 00:19:47,425
I was referring
to Adam and Eve!

410
00:19:47,493 --> 00:19:48,793
We're not Adam and Eve.

411
00:19:48,861 --> 00:19:50,662
You see, due to a series of...

412
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,399
Consummate your union,
or I shall destroy Earth.

413
00:19:56,669 --> 00:19:59,070
Well... if it's to
save Earth...

414
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:01,639
I guess I could
take one for the team.

415
00:20:01,707 --> 00:20:03,742
Uh, what? Right now?!

416
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:05,777
But I need a romance first.

417
00:20:05,845 --> 00:20:07,946
Maybe a vanilla candle
or something?

418
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:09,781
Commence intercourse!

419
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,918
Those giant guns are
making me feel sort
of inadequate.

420
00:20:13,986 --> 00:20:15,553
I'm not sure if I can...

421
00:20:15,621 --> 00:20:18,189
Move it. I gotta get
home and do laundry.

422
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:24,362
For God's sake, censor it!
Censor it!

423
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,798
Approved for all audiences!

424
00:20:26,866 --> 00:20:28,366
No!

425
00:20:35,174 --> 00:20:37,609
And now,
the spicy finale of...

426
00:20:41,213 --> 00:20:43,982
That was a close call,
but we saved Earth.

427
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:47,318
Was it as good for you as
it was for the human race?

428
00:20:47,386 --> 00:20:48,620
Oh, Zapp.

429
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:52,123
Let's save another
planet right now!

430
00:20:56,627 --> 00:21:00,098
