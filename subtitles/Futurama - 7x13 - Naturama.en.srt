I'm lonesome.

Hey, would it cheer
you up if we gave you

a symbiotic parasite cleaning?

180
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,111
Would it? Would it? Would it?

182
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:35,181

186

Except for the parasite!

187
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,424
How's that, Hubert?
Feeling better?

188
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:46,926
(Sighs)

189
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,061
A good beaking usually
cheers me right up,

190
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,130
but today it's no use.

191
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,733
My species is
as good as extinct.

192
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,603
I haven't seen a female
of my kind in over 100 years!

193
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,071
There's got to be
a lady tortoise

194
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,473
out there for you, Hubert.

195
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,974
What about her?

196
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,743
Hey, good lookin',

197
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,445
I've got a lichen
that needs a lickin'.

198
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,080
Are you crazy?

199
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,182
She's a slightly
different subspecies!

200
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,419
See how her shell flares
imperceptibly at the neck?

201
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:16,455
Ooh... talk about
a cloaca shrinker.

202
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,457
Well, haven't you ever
met a girl tortoise

203
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,594
who had that whole "same
subspecies" thing going on?

204
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,295
Oh my, yes.

205
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,831
When I was a young
tortoise of 50

206
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,867
I met a hot young
piece of shell

207
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:31,771
by a palo santo tree on
the far side of the island.

208
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:34,874
Let's go look for her!
C'Mon, c'Mon, c'Mon!

209
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:39,278
I've always wondered if she's
still there, waiting for me.

210
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,647
But the trip is far too long.

211
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:42,882
It's only 100 feet!

212
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,150
At my age,

213
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,385
it might as well be 200 feet.

214
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,020
I'd never make it!

215
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,555
Come on, you can make it!
You can do it!

216
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,023
Get out of your shell.
Do it, do it!

217
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,293
Well, let me think it over.

218
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:57,630
Let's go already!

219
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,074
(Owl hooting)

220
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,910

222
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,920
(Gasps) Watch out!

223
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,723
What brings yous to this part of
the isleseses?

224
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,991
(Screams)

225
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,226
He's gonna eat us!

226
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,861
Don't be such a Finch.

227
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:32,431
We Galápagos tortoises
have no natural predators.

228
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,867
Finch Amy (Muffled):
That's so fascinating!

229
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:55,187
I never thought I'd live
to see this tree again.

230
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,523
Thank you for staying
with me, Fry.

231
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:58,858
I'm not Fry.

232
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:00,593
I'm his great-great grandson...
Fry.

233
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,594
Whuh...?

234
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,262
My beak is different, see?

235
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,264
It evolved a slightly bigger
hook over the generations,

236
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,100
to help me eat the cactus
on this part of the island.

237
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,101
Watch!

238
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,102
(Grunting)

239
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,103
I'm stuck!

240
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,571
Oops.

241
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,573
So where's your
lady tortoise, Hubert?

242
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,442
Lady whuh?

243
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,277
Wait, there she is!

244
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,247
After all these years,
I've found her!

245
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:24,550
Oh, my darling!

246
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:26,919
You haven't aged a day!

247
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,387
Should we say something?

248
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,322
Nah.
Let him have his fun.

249
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,724
All right.

250
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,593
Let's just do what
comes naturally.

251
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:38,631
I'll get things started with
a little neck extension...

252
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:42,268
Then a couple of these...

253
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:45,137
And here we go!

254
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,140
What the tropical hell
are you doing?!

255
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,909
(All gasping) Whuh?

256
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,845
I've been saving myself
for a hundred years,

257
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,980
and this is how you repay me?

258
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,582
Who is that
hard-shelled skank?

259
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,616
I'll kill her!

260
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,518
Wait, I can explain...

261
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:00,853
shut up!

262
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,655
I'm going
to crack that hussy open

263
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,490
like a slutty Brazil nut!

264
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:11,697
(Grunts)

265
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:14,166
This volcanic archipelago

266
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,001
isn't big enough
for the both of us.

267
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:22,775
Yeah, you'd better topple.

268
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:26,378
You always were a
hot-blooded latina.

271
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:36,488
Okay, neck, tap, tap,
climb, climb, and...

272
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,190
We're back in business.

273
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,659
Um, should we be watching this?

274
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,161
It seems kind of personal.

275
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,495
That's not an issue for us.

276
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:44,964
We're wildlife.

(Weak, raspy moaning)

278
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,001
What about the moaning?

279
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,469
Is it okay to listen?

280
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:53,172
Sure, but act like
it's no big deal.

281
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,007
Just pretend
you're eating seeds.

282

Is it weird if I talk about

No.

284
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:12,191
Well, okay then.

285
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,593
Yes, it's been lovely.

286
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:15,594

Oh, what do you want?
I'm 150 years old.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

292
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,681
Aren't you going
to watch over your young?

293
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:38,283
Tortoises don't do that, do we?

294
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,452
I sure as hell don't.

295
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,554
Anyway, I've done my part.

<i>maintains a harem</i>
<i>of up to 50 females.</i>

326
00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:13,998
Okay, harem, let's get to it.

327
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:15,366
Form an orderly heap
on top of me.

328
00:15:15,434 --> 00:15:17,201
(Cows barking)

329
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:20,805
I like mating with beachmaster
'cause he's the largest.

330
00:15:20,873 --> 00:15:23,975
Narrator: <i>While the beachmaster
enjoys the spoils of victory...</i>

331
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:25,043
Whoo!

332
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,045
I'm doin' it in my sleep!

333
00:15:27,112 --> 00:15:30,081
<i>...the lesser males languish</i>
<i>at the edge of the colony,</i>

334
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:33,051
<i>unable to attract</i>
<i>their own harem due to age...</i>

335
00:15:33,118 --> 00:15:35,186
Harem?!
I can barely see 'em!

336
00:15:35,254 --> 00:15:36,387
<i>Immaturity...</i>

337
00:15:36,455 --> 00:15:37,388
(High-pitched laugh)

338
00:15:37,456 --> 00:15:38,890
I'm scared.

339
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,591
<i>...or other reasons.</i>

340
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:42,560
Hmm. I don't know...

341
00:15:42,628 --> 00:15:45,363
Does this kelp scarf
make me look fat enough?

342
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:48,599
It's so unfair.

343
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,336
That bloated Casanova
gets all the ladies!

344
00:15:51,403 --> 00:15:54,572
Even that one with the
exquisite fat rolls.

345
00:15:57,276 --> 00:15:58,710
(Bleating)

346
00:15:58,777 --> 00:15:59,744

347
00:15:59,812 --> 00:16:00,745
(Bellowing)

348
00:16:00,813 --> 00:16:01,879
(Terrified yelp)

349
00:16:01,947 --> 00:16:03,281
Back off, losers!

350
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:05,083
Stay away from my beaches!

351
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,718
You big bully!

352
00:16:06,785 --> 00:16:10,254
Bite my freshly molted,
blubber-filled ass.

353
00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:12,223
You're just a giant lump of fat!

354
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,092
Do you even
have an ass under there?!

355
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,394
I'm 40% ass!

356
00:16:15,395 --> 00:16:16,395
Arf, arf!

357
00:16:16,463 --> 00:16:18,164
Now beat it! Boo!

358
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:19,265
(All gasping, shuddering)

359
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:21,233
(Laughs)

360
00:16:21,301 --> 00:16:23,803
Narrator: <i>With no hope of</i>
<i>defeating the beachmaster,</i>

361
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,740
<i>some so-called "sneaky" males</i>
<i>adopt a risky strategy...</i>

<i>while he is asleep</i>
<i>or distracted.</i>

364
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:33,412
So, any of you guys thinking

365
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,314
of being a sneaky male
this season?

366
00:16:35,382 --> 00:16:36,949
(All muttering uneasily)

367
00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:38,317
This season?

368
00:16:38,385 --> 00:16:40,252
Walrus don't need no chicanery.

369
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,089
Once a lady goes
walrus, she never...

370
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:45,157
She ne...

371
00:16:45,225 --> 00:16:47,159
No one ever goes walrus.

372
00:16:47,227 --> 00:16:49,328
I'm a little old for it now,

373
00:16:49,396 --> 00:16:52,164
but in my prime,
I was quite the sneaker.

374
00:16:52,232 --> 00:16:53,165
How did you do it?

375
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:55,634
Well, while
the beachmaster was off

376
00:16:55,702 --> 00:16:57,169
behind a whale carcass,

377
00:16:57,237 --> 00:16:59,972
loudly fornicating
with my beloved mother,

378
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,042
I snuck past
and surprised my sweetie

379
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,177
with a romantic meal.

380
00:17:05,245 --> 00:17:07,713
A romantic meal, eh?

381
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:11,250
Narrator: <i>The search for food</i>

<i>to depths</i>
<i>few other mammals can reach.</i>

383
00:17:18,325 --> 00:17:20,526
<i>In this pitch-black abyss,</i>

384

<i>life takes on</i>
<i>bizarre and horrific forms.</i>

385
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:26,499
Zoidberg:
So, welcome to the abyss.

386
00:17:27,734 --> 00:17:29,401
Road trip!

387
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:30,970
(Snoring)

388
00:17:31,037 --> 00:17:32,471
Kill all penguins...

(Snoring)

390
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:35,407
(Pups squealing)
Kill all penguins.

391
00:17:35,475 --> 00:17:36,408
(Screaming)

392
00:17:36,476 --> 00:17:37,710
(Snorts) Huh?

393
00:17:37,778 --> 00:17:39,245
What's the matter with you!?

394
00:17:39,312 --> 00:17:41,547
You just crushed
seven of our babies!

395
00:17:41,615 --> 00:17:43,749
Yeah, we can always make more.

396
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:46,919
Come on, floozies,
let's repopulate!

397
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:48,888
Narrator:
<i>With the beachmaster occupied,</i>

398
00:17:48,955 --> 00:17:51,357

00:17:53,293 --> 00:17:54,360
(Gasps)

400
00:17:54,427 --> 00:17:56,028
I can't believe you came!

401
00:17:56,096 --> 00:17:58,397
The beachmaster'll kill
you if he finds out!

402
00:17:58,465 --> 00:18:00,199
Also, who are you?

403
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:01,200
(Spits)

404
00:18:01,268 --> 00:18:02,334
I'm in love with you!

405
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:04,203
And I don't care what he thinks.

406
00:18:04,271 --> 00:18:06,172
Here, I brought you something.

407
00:18:07,107 --> 00:18:08,440
Hooray!

408
00:18:08,508 --> 00:18:09,875
We're three friends
at the beach!

409
00:18:09,943 --> 00:18:11,544
(Munching)

410
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:12,545
Wait, what's happening, friend?

411
00:18:12,612 --> 00:18:14,180
(Screams)

412
00:18:14,247 --> 00:18:16,816
Narrator: <i>The female</i>
<i>conveys her receptivity</i>

<i>through subtle vocalizations.</i>

414
00:18:18,852 --> 00:18:19,785
Wanna do it?

415
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:20,786
So soon?!

416
00:18:20,854 --> 00:18:22,888
Oh, well... (Stammering)

(Both gasp)

418

Sneaky male, eh?

419
00:18:27,093 --> 00:18:28,460
I thought I told you...

420

(Roaring)

421
00:18:29,696 --> 00:18:30,629
(Shuddering):
Oh, my...!

422
00:18:32,132 --> 00:18:33,432
Well, nice try.
Better luck next season.

423
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,466
You gave it a shot!

424
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:35,467
Pathetic.

425
00:18:44,377 --> 00:18:46,145
Sorry you didn't get to mate.

426
00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:48,414
But, hey, we can still
play some beach games.

427
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:50,482
Who's up for some twister?

428
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,717
No!

429
00:18:51,785 --> 00:18:53,652
We beta males deserve better.

430
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,722
When we're in charge, we'll
treat females with respect,

431
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,792
keeping sensible harems
of no more than five.

432
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,394
And it begins with me.

433
00:19:02,462 --> 00:19:07,333
Sir, I challenge you to a duel
for control of the beach!

434

(All gasping)

435
00:19:08,802 --> 00:19:10,069
Aw...

437
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,110
Aw, hang on...

00:19:25,218 --> 00:19:26,585
Okay, let's fight.

(Yelling, grunting)

446
00:19:58,585 --> 00:20:00,319
Beachmaster, stop fighting!

447
00:20:00,387 --> 00:20:02,821
He's been dead since yesterday!

448
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:05,057
(Snorts)
What?! He's dead?!

449
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,525
Whoo!

450
00:20:06,593 --> 00:20:08,327
I'm killin' dudes in my sleep!

451

<i>order is restored</i>
<i>for another year.</i>

455
00:20:23,543 --> 00:20:25,711
Another year,

fathered by me, beachmaster.

457

(All snickering)

458
00:20:32,118 --> 00:20:33,686
I'm the greatest, baby!

459
00:20:33,753 --> 00:20:35,988
You go, beachmaster!
