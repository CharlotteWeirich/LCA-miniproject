Just go to your stupid party.

81
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:18,645
We can have dinner on my
birthday some other year.

82
00:03:18,713 --> 00:03:21,014
No! I can throw up
on a stripper anytime.

83
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:23,650
Tonight, I want to not throw up...

84

On you.

(Crickets chirping)

91
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,801
I just have to sign
leela's birthday card.

92
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:44,337
- How do you spell "XO"?
- Guh!

93
00:03:44,405 --> 00:03:46,272
It's a record-your-own-message
card.

94
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,209
You don't sign it. You leave
a nude video greeting.

95
00:03:49,276 --> 00:03:50,810
Does it have to be nude?

96
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:53,179
I guess not.
That never occurred to me.

97
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:56,049
If I leave now, record a
birthday greeting on the way,

98
00:03:56,117 --> 00:03:57,951
score some fancy cologne
at the newsstand,

99
00:03:58,018 --> 00:03:59,686
I'll be exactly on time.

You're not going anywhere!

101
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:03,223
But I have a date.

102
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,958
You were late this morning,

103
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:07,961
so you have to stay and test
my latest invention!

104
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:09,996
Behold!

105
00:04:10,064 --> 00:04:11,998
A time-traveling machine!

Time? I can't go back there!

108
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,006
Ah, but this time machine
only goes forward in time!

109
00:04:20,074 --> 00:04:22,675
That way you can't accidentally
change history

110
00:04:22,743 --> 00:04:26,679
or do something disgusting, like
sleep with your own grandmother.

111
00:04:26,747 --> 00:04:28,081
I wouldn't want to do that again.

112
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:29,616
We're going to test it

113
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:31,718
by going forward in time one minute.

114
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:33,853
(Alarm chirps) Get in.

115
00:04:33,921 --> 00:04:35,989
Okay, hurry. Let's get it over with.

116
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:37,257
I can record Leela's birthday card

117
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:38,558
while we're in there.

118
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:42,662
(Softly):
Happy Birthday, Leela!

119
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,097
I'm really sorry I'm gonna be
one minute late,

120
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:45,632
'cause we're testing the Professor's

121

dumb time machine, but...

122
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:48,835
Okay, I'll just nudge us forward

123
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:51,571
exactly one minute into the...

124

Relax, Fry.

135
00:05:22,203 --> 00:05:25,405
Everyone we ever knew
died thousands of years ago.

No! They did it!

They blew it up!

142
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:45,091
And then the apes blew up
their society, too!

143
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,460
How could this happen?!

144
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:51,331
<i>And then the birds took over
and ruined their society!</i>

145
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:54,267
And the cows, and then...
I don't know.

146
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:55,535
Is that a slug maybe?

00:06:45,486 --> 00:06:46,953
Fry's not here.

167
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:49,022
Obviously, he went
to that pervert party

168
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:51,124
with Bender and the Professor.
(Snorts)

169
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:54,661
Fry went to the party?
(Snorts)

170
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:56,896
<i>Linda (On tv):
We interrupt hypnotoad on ice</i>

171
00:06:56,964 --> 00:06:59,232
to bring you breaking coverage
of the disaster

172
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,335
at Hedonismbot's bachelor party.
(All gasp)

173
00:07:02,403 --> 00:07:06,239
Linda, what began as innocent
fun ended in tragedy tonight

174
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:08,575
when a nuclear-powered
robot stripper

175
00:07:08,642 --> 00:07:11,010
suffered a catastrophic
reactor meltdown.

176
00:07:11,078 --> 00:07:13,413
There is only one survivor.

177
00:07:13,481 --> 00:07:16,549
Everywhere I looked,
there were piles of bodies.

178
00:07:16,617 --> 00:07:21,588
And then the explosion struck.
(Sobbing)

179
00:07:21,655 --> 00:07:25,391
The three co-workers I liked
are all dead!

180
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:27,427
Fry stood me up and died?!

181
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:29,429
I'm so angry!

182
00:07:29,497 --> 00:07:30,964
I mean, I'm so sad!

183
00:07:31,031 --> 00:07:33,399
But... But I'm still pretty angry!

184
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:35,134
But also sad.

185
00:07:35,202 --> 00:07:36,536
Can I be both?

186
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:38,037
It's what he'd want.

187
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:39,339
Then that's what I am!

188
00:07:39,406 --> 00:07:42,008
Hi-ya! (Sobbing)

189
00:07:42,076 --> 00:07:44,377
(Fire crackling)

190
00:07:48,549 --> 00:07:50,583
Man, the future is a total craphole,

191
00:07:50,651 --> 00:07:53,253
and whoever lives here
is a crap-faced sack of crap!

192
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,921
No offense, fellas.

193
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:56,456
Don't sweat it, man.

194
00:07:56,524 --> 00:07:59,392
(Sighs)
I'll never see Leela again.

195
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,861
No, without a backwards
time machine,

196
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:03,863
we're stuck in this craphole.

197
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:06,032
- Dude, give it a rest.
- Hold on.

198
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,401
I've got it!
We can't go back in time,

199
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:10,336
but we can keep going forward

200
00:08:10,404 --> 00:08:13,039
until people invent
the backwards time machine.

201
00:08:13,107 --> 00:08:14,440
<i>And then we can go home.</i>

202
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:16,009
Hit it.

Sometimes I can't believe
how successful

226
00:09:31,518 --> 00:09:34,287
Planet Express became
once the Professor was killed

227
00:09:34,355 --> 00:09:36,055
and you seized control.

228
00:09:36,123 --> 00:09:39,058
There were tough times,
but we all pulled together.

229

I laid you off 20 years ago.

Woop-woop-woop-woo...

234
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:51,771
Oh, the claws can't flee
like they used to.

235
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,139
Success is nice,

236
00:09:53,207 --> 00:09:55,908

(Slurps)

238
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,214
Hey, Leels.

(Adenoidal voice):
May we help you, strange ones?

242
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:18,131
We are travelers from the past,
my good runt.

243
00:10:18,198 --> 00:10:19,666
I see.

244
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:23,369
Since your time, human
evolution has diverged.

245
00:10:23,437 --> 00:10:28,174
There are we... Advanced in
intellect and morality...

246
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:31,044
And the dumblocks...
Stupid, vicious brutes

247
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:32,612
who live underground.

248
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,114
Advanced in intellect, you say?

249
00:10:35,182 --> 00:10:38,051
Have you invented a
backwards time machine?

250
00:10:38,118 --> 00:10:40,420
No, but if we apply
our superior minds,

251
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:43,923
we could perfect such a
device within five years.

252
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:45,124
See you then!

253
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:46,259
(Whooshes)

254
00:10:49,363 --> 00:10:51,964
We're back for our time machine!

255
00:10:52,032 --> 00:10:53,199
(Grunts)

256
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:54,400
Ow!

257
00:10:54,468 --> 00:10:56,402
(Lasers zapping)

258
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,473

00:11:02,276 --> 00:11:03,910
Yoo-hoo, boys!

261
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:06,412
What's this era in human history like?

262
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,014
The machines...

263
00:11:08,082 --> 00:11:09,982
We built them to make
our lives easier,

264
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,451
but they rebelled.

265
00:11:11,518 --> 00:11:14,854
They won't stop
until every human is dead.

266
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:16,355
This seems like a nice future.

267
00:11:16,423 --> 00:11:18,224
Let's just stay here.

268
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:21,060
We could settle down
on that mountain of skulls.

269
00:11:23,063 --> 00:11:25,398
Hey! That place had
a gorgeous view

270
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:27,100
of Blood Lake!

271
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:31,537
Greetings, time travelers.

272
00:11:31,605 --> 00:11:33,106
Stupid jerks!

273
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:35,308
Wouldn't let me stay
in the good future.

274
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,243
How did you know
we're time travelers?

275
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:39,879
We, too, study
the time travel enigma.

276
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:42,281
We have perfected a
method using negative-mass

277
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:44,550
neutrino fields that allows us

278
00:11:44,618 --> 00:11:46,285
to travel backwards in time.

279
00:11:46,353 --> 00:11:48,087
My name's Hubert.

280
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:50,223
All right! We can go home!

281
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,025
(Mocking): All right!
We can go... (Blows raspberry)

282
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:54,961
We can talk of our research
tomorrow.

283
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:57,430
Men are very rare in our society.

284
00:11:57,498 --> 00:12:00,266
Even very old and
stupid males are prized.

285
00:12:00,334 --> 00:12:04,137
Tonight, please be the guests of
honor at our fertility banquet.

286
00:12:04,204 --> 00:12:07,440
Well, there's certainly no harm
in a fertility banquet.

287
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:08,908
I could eat.

288
00:12:08,976 --> 00:12:10,243
And fertilize.

289
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,145
Very well.

290
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:15,248
Let us anoint our guests in oil
without using our hands.

291
00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:17,450
Oh, so we can stay
in the future you like,

292
00:12:17,518 --> 00:12:19,452
but not the future I like?

293
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,154
Next!

294
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:22,622
No!

295
00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:24,624
I was about to close the deal!

296
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:27,126
Bender, they had
a backwards time machine!

297
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:29,295
The other place had a lot
of good things, too!

298
00:12:29,363 --> 00:12:31,764
Did you even see
that mountain of skulls?

299
00:12:31,832 --> 00:12:32,965
Why, you!

300
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:35,768
Oh, no, you didn't.

301
00:12:35,836 --> 00:12:37,970
(All grunting)

302
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:39,438
Stop!

303
00:12:39,506 --> 00:12:41,440
Somewhere, some time,
Leela is waiting for me.

304
00:12:41,508 --> 00:12:43,876
We need to keep looking
for a backwards time machine.

305
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:45,178
Fry's right.

306
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,180
Yes. We have to work together,

307
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:48,948
not have this fight,

308
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:50,750
which I was definitely winning.

309
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:54,387
Professor:
The year one billion.

310
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:57,390
I've got a feeling this could be
exactly the point in time

311
00:12:57,457 --> 00:12:58,991
we've been looking for!

312
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:01,460
(Wind whistling)
Professor: Nope.

313
00:13:01,528 --> 00:13:03,029
(Trilling)

314
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:04,497
(Buzzer sounds)

315
00:13:04,565 --> 00:13:07,700
In fact, all life is extinct.

316
00:13:07,768 --> 00:13:09,168
(Laughs)

317
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:10,369
So let's keep going forward.

318
00:13:10,437 --> 00:13:11,938
Oh, it's no use.

319
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:13,773
Earth is dead.

320
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:16,976
This is the end of all things.

321
00:13:32,593 --> 00:13:35,294
The Cavern on the Green.

322
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:41,868
(Echoing):
I made it, Leela.

323
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:44,237
Sorry I'm a billion years late.

324
00:13:44,304 --> 00:13:45,671
(Gasps)

325
00:13:47,742 --> 00:13:48,946
Dear Fry

326
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,070
You'll get your alimony check, Cubert.

327
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,538
Now get lost!

328
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:00,906
Chill out.

329
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,941
I'm just here to see Amy.

330
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,910
Move it, boy toy.

331
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,346
Granny's taking you
to Atlantic City.

332
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,051
I don't know why you ever
married that pig-nosed punk.

333
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,553
I don't know, either.

334
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,954
I'm married to the job now.

335
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,357
I used to think
there was someone for me, but...

336
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,758
Ow!

337
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,059
How odd.

338
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,661
It's one of those old

339
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,730
record-your-own-message
birthday cards.

340
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,198
(Music plays)

341
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,933
(Softly):
Happy Birthday, Leela!

342
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,901
I'm really sorry
I'm gonna be one minute late,

343
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,670
'cause we're testing the
Professor's dumb time machine...

344
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,505
Okay, I'll just nudge us forward...

345
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,574
But, uh, you know, um, happy
birthday and all, and, uh...

346
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:36,942
Exactly one minute into the...

347
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,577
I love you.
Whoa!

348
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:39,745
(All yelling)
Fry: My card!

349
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:40,779
Leela: Ow!

350
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:48,053
My whole life I've been mad
at him, and it wasn't his fault.

351
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,059
(Whooshing)

352
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,978
(High-pitched whooshing)

353
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,621
(Water dripping)

354
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,399
Leela (Reading):

355
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:40,735
Dear Fry, our time together was short
but it was the best time of my life.

356
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,041
(Loud splash of water)

357
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,848
You know, all in all,
I had a good life.

358
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,950
What do you say
the three of us grab a six-pack

359
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,485
and watch the universe end?

360
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:54,920
Hear! Hear!

361
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,823
That's basically
what I do every day.

362
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,893
To the end of the universe!

363
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,030
(Loud whoosh)

364
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,032
(Trilling)

365
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,536
(Loud whooshing)

366
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,674
(Explosion)

367
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,142
So long, Earth.

368
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,144
Thanks for the air and whatnot.

369
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,012
(Whooshing)

370
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,415
(Popping)

371
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,587
All:
Whoa!

372
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,056
Hey, uh, what was the purpose
of life, anyway?

373
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,891
Who knows.

374
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,827
Probably some hogwash
about the human spirit.

375
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,062
- Mm-hmm.
- Sounds about right.

376
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,498
(Whooshing)

377
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,367
Professor:
The stars are receding.

378
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,636
Oh, the vast emptiness!

379
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:49,608
Yeah, yeah, I can take a hint.

380
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,810
(Trilling)

381
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,545
Ah.

382
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:57,149
The last proton should be
decaying about now.

383
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,583
Bye, last proton.

384
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,119
And... here we are.

385
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,755
The end of the universe.

386
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,063
Well, now what?

387
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,598
You guys want to talk?

388
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,133
No, thanks.

389
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,135
- Ooh! Oh!
- Wow! Oh!

390
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,337
Did anyone else see that?!

391
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,672
Unbelievable!

392
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,974
It's a second Big Bang!

393
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,844
(Whooshing)

394
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:31,883
My God, is it possible?

395
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:33,785
It must be possible. It's happening.

396
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,921
By the way, what's happening?

397
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,690
It appears this universe
is exactly identical

398
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,525
to the old one.

399
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:44,362
If so, we just need
to keep going forward in time

400
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,364
to the point when we left!

401
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,133
(Whooshing)

402
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,869
(Explosive pops)

403
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,837
The Earth is born!

404
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,640
(Rumbling)

405
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,643
(Whoosh and explosion)

406
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:02,180
Professor:
Ladies and gentlemen, the Moon!

407
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,050
Look. The first fish
to crawl up on land.

408
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,452
Bender (Grunts):
it was coming right at us!

409
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,887
You saw it.

410
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,989
I'm gonna grab another beer.

411
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:13,892
Fry, Fry, you're
missing the dinosaurs!

412
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,695
It's okay. They're not
going anywhere.

413
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,396
Where'd they go?

414
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,400
(Weapons firing)

415
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,102
(Gunfire)

416
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,571
(Gunshots)

417
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,073
Now, what's going on there?

418
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,608
History.

419
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,710
Hang on. I just want
to make one stop.

420
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,011
(Whoosh)

421
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,546
(Gun chamber cocking)

422
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,181
(Loud cheering)

423
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:39,050
<i>Betrachten sie meinen
schnurrbart!</i>

424
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,752
(High-pitched whirring, poof)

425
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,655
(Whoosh)

426
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,357
(Soft crackling sound)

427
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,659
(Explosions)

428
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,896
(Explosions)

429
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,871
Professor:
Easy. Easy.

430
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,740
Taking her in for a landing.

431
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,608
One year to go.

432
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,010
Six months.

433
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,745
I'm almost there, Leela.

434
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,880
One month...
Two weeks...

435
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:10,348
One hour...

436
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,017
30 seconds...

437
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,419
And here we...

438
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,987
Professor: Whoa!
(Thudding)

439
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:18,323
Stop!
Give me the keys, Magoo!

440
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,727
(Fry grunting)

441
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:25,730
We'll have to bring her
around again.

442
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:28,333
(Trilling)

443
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:31,236
(Whooshing)

444
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,005
(Pop)

445
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,907
(Explosive whirring)

446
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,977
Just slow it down. I'll shoot
Hitler out the window.

447
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,545
(Whirring)

448
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,648
Darn! I hit Eleanor
Roosevelt by mistake.

449
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:46,551
Okay, nearing our era again.

450
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,520
Here we go.

451
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,889
Careful this time.

452
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,991
Careful.

453
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,592
We're going to test it

454
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,795
by going forward
in time one minute.

455
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,430
(Alarm chirps) Get in.

456
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,231
Okay. Hurry.
Let's get it over with.

457
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,800
(Whirring) Wha...?

458
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,601
Professor:
Uh-oh.

459
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:07,405
This new universe is about
ten feet lower than our old one.

460
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,178
Pow! We took care of
the time travel paradox.

461
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,612
- All right!
- Hooray!

462
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,081
Yabba-dabba-doo!

463
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,350
Uh-oh. I'm late for dinner with Leela.

464
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,784
(Fry panting)

465
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,753
(Water dripping)

466
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,421
Welcome to cavern on the green.

467
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,724
May I offer you some meat loaf
while you wait?

468
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,026
(Panting) Sorry I'm late!

469
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:31,162
- Actually, you're on time.
- Really?

470
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,998
I have to admit, I was
afraid you wouldn't make it.

471
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,834
(Sputters)
That was the old Fry.

472
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,069
He's dead now.

473
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:41,473
Fry: Happy Birthday, Leela.

474
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,042
I got you a card, but I
guess I kind of lost it.

475
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,644
That's okay.
I don't really like cards.

476
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,681
What I'll remember
is our time together.
