00:00:24,244 --> 00:00:27,147
Boy, that thing's big.

5
00:00:27,182 --> 00:00:30,054
Fry, is my colossal eye too big?

6
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:32,256
No, it's what makes you you.

7
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,992
But it's so round,
so hideously round.

8
00:00:36,027 --> 00:00:38,761
Leela, listen, you're
the most beautiful woman

9
00:00:38,796 --> 00:00:40,096
I've ever known.

10
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,832
Oh, so you only care
about my looks?

11
00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:44,666
No, I... what?

12
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:48,068
Finally, new New York got
a blast of class today

13
00:00:48,102 --> 00:00:51,937
As Nikolai, playboy ruler
of the robo-Hungarian empire,

14
00:00:51,972 --> 00:00:55,240
<i>Arrived aboard his extravagant
caviar-powered yacht.</i>

15
00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:59,944
I am just a humble emperor
with a big, big crown.

16
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:01,781
Of course I'm not planning
to steal that crown.

17
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:03,216
What?

18
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,987
True, I've always dreamt
of being an emperor,

19
00:01:06,022 --> 00:01:08,158
You know, for Halloween,
and then forever,

20
00:01:08,192 --> 00:01:11,161
But heisting those jewels
would be difficult.

21
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:12,562
You'd be stupid to try.

22
00:01:12,597 --> 00:01:13,899
I'll need accomplices...

23
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:16,568
A sexy vamp to distract
and tie up the guard...

24
00:01:16,603 --> 00:01:18,170
Never.

25
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:20,640
A claw man to slip
past the metal scanner

26
00:01:20,674 --> 00:01:22,208
And cut the alarm wires...

27
00:01:22,243 --> 00:01:25,948
Sorry, I'm set for life
after that last job.

28
00:01:29,686 --> 00:01:31,054
And finally, a chump

29
00:01:31,088 --> 00:01:33,657
To be caught on video
and later arrested.

30
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:35,259
As I told you on
sucker-punch day,

31
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:37,228
I'm through being a chump.

32
00:01:37,262 --> 00:01:40,765
Of course, it would all require
split-second, robotic timing.

33
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,101
That's where I come in.

34
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:45,638
You see, I own a watch.

35
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,874
There.

36
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,878
This time I'm sure I've
fixed the mind-switcher.

37
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:54,782
Good, I'm sick of cleaning up
those heaps of dead monkeys.

38
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:57,085
But why would you want
your mind in a new body?

39
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,088
Well, as a man enters
his 18th decade,

40
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:03,225
He thinks back on the mistakes
he's made in life.

41
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:05,027
Like the heaps of dead monkeys?

42
00:02:05,062 --> 00:02:07,630
Science cannot move forward
without heaps.

43
00:02:07,664 --> 00:02:12,267
No, what I regret is the youth
I wasted playing it safe.

44
00:02:12,302 --> 00:02:15,170
I wasted my youth porking out.

45
00:02:15,204 --> 00:02:16,771
Yes, I remember.

46
00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:19,041
Would you please take that down?

47
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:20,810
It's making me hungry.

48
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:24,548
Funny, I could use
a little extra meat on my bones.

49
00:02:24,582 --> 00:02:26,050
Wait a second.

50
00:02:26,084 --> 00:02:29,821
If we switched bodies,
I could live life to the extreme

51
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:32,824
And you could indulge
your demonic food lust.

52
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:34,293
we're just the people

53
00:02:34,327 --> 00:02:37,229
This mind-switcher
was made for by us.

54
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,667
Wait, can I still
change my mind?

55
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:43,335
Let's find out.

56
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:51,610
It didn't work, you
doddering old...

57
00:02:52,846 --> 00:02:54,813
Ah, cartilage.

58
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,816
Dude, I bid you
a fond cowabunga.

59
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,754
I'm off to laugh at the reaper.

60
00:03:05,793 --> 00:03:06,960
Yee-haw!

61
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:08,161
Look out, world, here I...

62
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:16,770
I'm sorry, Amy, but your
body's not up to the task.

63
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:18,706
Also, I don't care
for these boobs

64
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,708
Flapping every which way.

65
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:22,243
Now, quit
your bologna-gargling

66
00:03:22,278 --> 00:03:25,046
And let's switch back
into our original bodies.

67
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:26,648
Body-switching, eh?

68
00:03:26,682 --> 00:03:28,951
Mayhap the heist is back on.

69
00:03:28,986 --> 00:03:32,021
Who needs accomplices
if I can just use their bodies?

70
00:03:37,227 --> 00:03:39,796
Professor, what's not happening?

71
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,664
Bad news, me.

72
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:44,968
I failed to take into account
the cerebral immune response.

73
00:03:45,002 --> 00:03:46,670
You idiot!

74
00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:49,006
Once two bodies
have switched minds,

75
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,275
They can never switch back.

76
00:03:53,112 --> 00:03:55,113
However, perhaps they can.

77
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:57,783
Maybe we can swap back
using a third body

78
00:03:57,817 --> 00:04:00,185
For temporary storage space.

79
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:03,055
I'm 60% storage space.

80
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:05,290
Yeah, wha... I... Hmm?

81
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,528
Well, I'm off to
the royal yacht

82
00:04:09,562 --> 00:04:10,729
For a quick
seduce-and-snatch.

83
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:12,698
See you.

84
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:15,701
Now then, Amy, we'll
simply switch bodies

85
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:16,902
And then we'll, we'll...

86
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:18,603
No, I'd be back

87
00:04:18,638 --> 00:04:21,740
In my body, but then you
and bender would be switched,

88
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:24,643
And the Amy and bender bodies
can't trade minds again,

89
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:26,278
Since they just did.

90
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:27,846
Oh, no.

91
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,882
Is it possible to get
everyone back to normal

92
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,684
Using four or more bodies?

93
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:32,919
I'm not sure.

94
00:04:32,953 --> 00:04:37,724
I'm afraid we need
to use... Math.

95
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:45,166
Stupid air-needing lungs.

96
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:48,002
the crown jewels.

97
00:04:48,036 --> 00:04:49,670
Now I just have

98
00:04:49,704 --> 00:04:52,873
To locate the guard and
seduce him in... Four seconds?!

99
00:04:52,908 --> 00:04:54,075
Who goes there?

100
00:04:54,109 --> 00:04:56,777
Three, two, one.

101
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:58,312
Hello, big boy.

102
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:02,950
Silence.
I am basil,

103
00:05:02,984 --> 00:05:04,985
The emperor's cousin
and chief of his royal guard,

104
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,720
And I shall not be
seduced by a...

105
00:05:07,955 --> 00:05:09,255
I said...

106
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:19,499
Professor, what's the matter?

107
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:20,700
I'm Amy.

108
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:22,735
The Professor and I
switched bodies.

109
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,638
Oh, lord.
All I wanted was to
gorge myself a little,

110
00:05:26,673 --> 00:05:29,075
But I can't digest anything
with these false teeth

111
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:31,143
And this hit-or-miss colon.

112
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:33,279
At least you get
a senior discount at the movies.

113
00:05:33,313 --> 00:05:37,816
I hate paying $14 to see
Nicolas cage solve things.

114
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,186
If you want to save two dollars,
we could switch bodies.

115
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:44,289
We can always switch back,
right?

116
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:50,827
Hey, Leela.

117
00:05:50,862 --> 00:05:52,996
Mmm, what smells saturated?

118
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,798
Deep-fried ice cream sandwich

119
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:57,033
Wrapped in frosting
and lightly baconed.

120
00:05:57,067 --> 00:06:00,170
Whoa, that sounds like something
Amy would say and eat.

121
00:06:00,204 --> 00:06:01,872
I am Amy.

122
00:06:01,906 --> 00:06:03,873
Leela and I used the Professor's
mind-switching machine.

123
00:06:03,908 --> 00:06:06,543
So Leela's in your body?

124
00:06:06,577 --> 00:06:08,012
Not exactly.

125
00:06:08,046 --> 00:06:12,483
<i>see, you do only
like me for my body.</i>

126
00:06:12,518 --> 00:06:15,120
That is entirely not true, sir.

127
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,658
Now to go switch bodies
with zoidberg,

128
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:22,861
Sneak past the metal detector,
and clip the alarm wires,

129
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:25,730
All in less than...
Ten minutes ago?!

130
00:06:32,705 --> 00:06:36,208
Uh, could you come back
when my chump gets here?

131
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:39,936
Now then,

132
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,738
What is a filthy human doing
aboard my royal yacht?

133
00:06:42,772 --> 00:06:46,208
With all due respect, your
majesty, I'm a robot like you.

134
00:06:46,242 --> 00:06:47,943
I just switched bodies
with some bimbo.

135
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:51,180
Go ahead, ask me something
only a robot would know.

136
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:52,382
A reverse Turing test, eh?

137
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,583
Very good.

138
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:55,384
What is the square root
of nine?

139
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:58,188
Uh, hold on, let me
just get out a pencil.

140
00:06:58,222 --> 00:07:00,790
okay, look, I'm not
that kind of robot.

141
00:07:00,825 --> 00:07:02,559
I'm more this kind of robot.

142
00:07:04,296 --> 00:07:07,431
He steps forwards
but moves backwards.

143
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:10,401
By the gods, he is a machine.

144
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:14,306
No, that won't restore
everyone either.

145
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,244
Besides, I don't want
my decrepit old body back.

146
00:07:18,278 --> 00:07:20,747
I'm running away
with this invincible robot body

147
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:22,783
And joining something.

148
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:30,890
Look, I paid for 15 robot clowns
per cubic meter of car,

149
00:07:30,924 --> 00:07:33,159
And you're barely giving me 12.

150
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:35,194
Now, crumple up and get in...

151
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:36,596
And fasten your seatbelts.

152
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:40,633
Good day.

153
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:43,869
I am Nonchalanto
the robot daredevil,

154
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:46,471
And my dream is to risk my life

155
00:07:46,506 --> 00:07:49,341
In strange and original ways.

156
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,943
Hmm, you don't look
so foolhardy to me.

157
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:06,624
That's the dumbest thing
anybody's ever done.

158
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:09,628
You're hired.

159
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,400
So you're a common
bending robot

160
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:16,269
With a human peasant roommate?

161
00:08:16,303 --> 00:08:18,906
Oh, crap, that is what I am.

162
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,774
No, bender, I envy you.

163
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:22,910
I'm so bored with all these
pretentious trappings...

164
00:08:22,944 --> 00:08:26,247
The jewels, the parties,
the beautiful robo-women.

165
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:27,448
Hello.

166
00:08:29,618 --> 00:08:31,485
Ah, my fiancée princess Flavia.

167
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,254
Dearest, meet bender.

168
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:36,324
He's a robot in the body
of a Chinese Martian physicist.

169
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:38,226
How tedious.

170
00:08:38,261 --> 00:08:41,864
Oh, to escape this
gilded cage for a day.

171
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:44,567
You know,
we could trade bodies.

172
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:46,803
I could take over
the humdrum royal stuff,

173
00:08:46,837 --> 00:08:48,938
And you could be
a regular Joe for a day.

174
00:08:48,972 --> 00:08:51,842
Or more, much more.

175
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:53,910
In that horrid non-robot body?

176
00:08:53,945 --> 00:08:56,179
Sir, I have my standards.

177
00:08:56,213 --> 00:08:57,714
Ah, but what if I could put you

178
00:08:57,748 --> 00:09:00,349
In my fabulous
bending-robot body?

179
00:09:01,585 --> 00:09:03,752
Me, posing
as a lowly bending unit?

180
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:05,687
How wicked.

181
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:08,890
But wait, I'm supposed to give
a speech at the u.N. Tomorrow.

182
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,625
Can I trust you to do it?

183
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,595
You can trust anything.

184
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:18,766
So now Leela's all
crotchety 'cause she thinks

185
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:21,535
I'm not attracted to her
in the Professor's body.

186
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,471
You aren't, are you?
Of course not,

187
00:09:23,505 --> 00:09:25,206
But I was willing
to lie about it.

188
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,807
What more can a man do?

189
00:09:26,842 --> 00:09:29,310
A man can give her a toke
of her own medicine.

190
00:09:29,344 --> 00:09:32,280
Yes, I could put my mind
into a hideous body

191
00:09:32,315 --> 00:09:34,683
And show Leela
she's not attracted to me,

192
00:09:34,717 --> 00:09:39,255
But it would have to be a
really, really disgusting body.

193
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:42,725
Friends, friends, I've got
barnacles on my tuchus.

194
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:46,229
The long search is over.

195
00:09:46,263 --> 00:09:49,899
Wait here and earn interest
while I find my robot body.

196
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:53,802
Professor?

197
00:09:53,837 --> 00:09:55,437
Leela.
Amy?

198
00:09:55,472 --> 00:09:57,205
Bender.
Have you seen my body?

199
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,639
I think the Professor's in it.

200
00:09:58,674 --> 00:10:00,942
Yeah, he said something
about running away.

201
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,476
Then he ran away.

202
00:10:02,511 --> 00:10:03,744
What?!
Whither?!

203
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:16,889
What am I going to do?

204
00:10:16,924 --> 00:10:18,892
I got an emperor all
patsied up to switch bodies,

205
00:10:18,926 --> 00:10:20,760
But only with another robot.

206
00:10:20,795 --> 00:10:22,562
Washbucket full.

207
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:24,297
Scruffy's work here is done.

208
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,811
Now to find
emperor Von Richendoof.

209
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,813
Now to find scruffy.

210
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:42,783
Switch bodies?

211
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:45,285
I don't see why not.

212
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,687
I also don't see why.

213
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,391
In your face, Leela.

214
00:10:51,426 --> 00:10:54,662
If you're a bender, why is
your body full of fetid water?

215
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,598
If you're an emperor,
why don't you shut up?!

216
00:10:57,632 --> 00:11:00,234
Move it, fry! Oh!

217
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:02,336
Well, so long.

218
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:05,205
Wait. Point me to my
normal human roommate!

219
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,606
That's him there...
Maybe.

220
00:11:06,641 --> 00:11:08,675
Got to go!

221
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,543
Robot?

222
00:11:10,577 --> 00:11:13,212
Yes, 'tis I... Bender.

223
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:15,513
Do you not recognize
your own best friend?

224
00:11:15,548 --> 00:11:18,750
Aha! The guy
in this body has a friend!

225
00:11:18,784 --> 00:11:22,653
Bender, old pal,
it's me, the fry!

226
00:11:24,622 --> 00:11:26,490
But then Nicolas cage discovered

227
00:11:26,524 --> 00:11:27,891
The real treasure
was his family.

228
00:11:27,926 --> 00:11:29,360
Yes, I'll hold.

229
00:11:30,729 --> 00:11:32,296
Hey, Leela, look.

230
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,531
I'm in zoidberg!

231
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:35,366
Fry?!

232
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,201
Oh, you're not so shallow

233
00:11:37,236 --> 00:11:41,239
That you find me repulsive
'cause of my body, are you?

234
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:44,843
Not at all.

235
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:49,314
Amy?! Stop it!

236
00:11:49,349 --> 00:11:50,749
Fry, help!

237
00:11:50,783 --> 00:11:52,851
She's turning me
into a parade float.

238
00:11:52,885 --> 00:11:54,552
Ew, look at her!

239
00:11:56,622 --> 00:11:59,358
Oh, so you're so shallow
that my body disgusts you

240
00:11:59,392 --> 00:12:01,527
If it puts on
a little extra weight?

241
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:03,562
That wasn't
a little extra weight.

242
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,498
Admit it. You don't care
about the inner me at all.

243
00:12:06,532 --> 00:12:07,833
<i>No, you admit it!</i>

244
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:09,701
You'd be ashamed
to be seen in public

245
00:12:09,735 --> 00:12:11,202
With someone as hideous as me!

246
00:12:11,237 --> 00:12:12,670
Would not!
Oh, yeah?

247
00:12:12,705 --> 00:12:14,271
Then I challenge you

248
00:12:14,306 --> 00:12:16,940
To a romantic dinner
at Elzar's tonight.

249
00:12:16,975 --> 00:12:20,243
It's on.

250
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:25,547
Sweet orca of Majorca.

251
00:12:25,582 --> 00:12:27,917
You make fat Albert look
like normal Albert.

252
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:29,685
I don't know what to do.

253
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:31,320
Do you think
I should eat more butter?

254
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:33,489
I am putting a stop
to this right now.

255
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:35,191
Come on.
We're switching bodies.

256
00:12:35,225 --> 00:12:36,392
Hermes, no!

257
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:38,562
I'll ruin your body, too!

258
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:42,365
Three decades of the munchies
beat you to it.

259
00:12:59,717 --> 00:13:02,252
You make quite a
show, young man.

260
00:13:02,286 --> 00:13:04,788
You remind me of myself
as a young cannon.

261
00:13:04,822 --> 00:13:07,524
Big Bertha is
the circus's Grande dame.

262
00:13:07,558 --> 00:13:09,793
She shoots robots
through the air.

263
00:13:11,328 --> 00:13:13,397
Oh, excuse me.
Too much goulash.

264
00:13:13,431 --> 00:13:16,533
I've always wanted
to be shot out of something.

265
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:18,736
How about a quick blast
after lunch?

266
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,406
Alas, a fine big one like you
would shatter my barrel.

267
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:26,778
But, ah,
to amaze the crowd once more.

268
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:29,280
I understand the problems
of age,

269
00:13:29,315 --> 00:13:32,217
But suppose
I could put you in a new body?

270
00:13:32,251 --> 00:13:35,920
Never! My body may be
old, but it is mine,

271
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:39,457
And every crack, a memory of
heavy things shot a long way.

272
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:40,991
Good day!

273
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,635
I have everything
I ever wanted...

274
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:53,272
Money, wealth, riches.

275
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:54,907
Yet something's missing.

276
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:57,243
A hot princess
with whom to get grizzly.

277
00:13:57,277 --> 00:13:58,578
Hello.

278
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:00,380
Hello, baby!

279
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,484
Hey, what's going on here,
and why are you kissing

280
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,886
My dashing cousin
instead of me?

281
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,589
Nikolai, you imperial fool.

282
00:14:08,623 --> 00:14:11,359
We've been having an
affair for 700 years.

283
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,361
At long last, I shall kill you,

284
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:15,496
Blame the burglar,
and inherit the throne.

285
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:23,865
Farewell, Nikolai.

286
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,734
Wait. I'm not Nikolai!

287
00:14:25,768 --> 00:14:28,337
I'm bender, the fabulous
body-switching burglar.

288
00:14:31,074 --> 00:14:32,442
So you are.

289
00:14:32,476 --> 00:14:34,243
However, you do have
Nikolai's body,

290
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:36,312
And that's the part
we want to kill.

291
00:14:43,821 --> 00:14:45,355
Whoa! Whoa!

292
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,827
Great food, huh?

293
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:55,930
Ew!
I'm sorry, Leela.

294
00:14:55,965 --> 00:14:58,766
I hope that didn't make you
ashamed to be seen with me.

295
00:14:58,801 --> 00:15:00,135
Oh, my, no.

296
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:01,136
Excuse me.

297
00:15:05,943 --> 00:15:09,279
Oh, did my bodily
infirmity embarrass you?

298
00:15:09,313 --> 00:15:11,248
Not at all.
It's just another thing

299
00:15:11,282 --> 00:15:13,417
That makes you
a very special lady.

300
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:14,919
You mean, like my penis?

301
00:15:16,054 --> 00:15:17,054
Blech!

302
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:18,990
Yecch!
Admit it.

303
00:15:19,024 --> 00:15:20,658
You're disgusted by me.

304
00:15:20,692 --> 00:15:22,726
No. You're disgusted by me!

305
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,894
I'm as attracted to you
as I've ever been.

306
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:26,997
Prove it!

307
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,138
Well, bender,
here's our apartment

308
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:38,273
That we live in every day.

309
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:41,109
A floor?

310
00:15:41,143 --> 00:15:42,878
We live like kings!

311
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:44,379
Kings? Silence!

312
00:15:44,414 --> 00:15:46,315
Like you, I'm a common lout.

313
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,050
Now fetch me some
working-class cognac

314
00:15:48,085 --> 00:15:50,319
From our Brandy storeroom
that you know how to find.

315
00:15:59,064 --> 00:16:00,698
Relax, bender.

316
00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:03,033
I'll dry up that leak
with this heating box.

317
00:16:06,438 --> 00:16:07,871
Ah. Cigars.

318
00:16:07,906 --> 00:16:10,307
Light me up, old friend.

319
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:23,987
There you are, emperor Nikolai.

320
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:26,023
It's time for your
speech to the u.N.

321
00:16:26,057 --> 00:16:28,426
A what now?

322
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:33,865
Miss Wong?

323
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,134
No, scruffy, I am washbucket.

324
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:37,703
I love you.

325
00:16:37,737 --> 00:16:40,172
Washbucket has
always loved you.

326
00:16:42,976 --> 00:16:44,309
This is wrong, washbucket.

327
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:46,378
Oh, it would be
sweet for a while,

328
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:48,880
But in the back of
our minds, we'd know

329
00:16:48,914 --> 00:16:51,416
That I'm a man, and you're
janitorial equipment.

330
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:55,319
In another city,
we could be anyone we want!

331
00:16:55,353 --> 00:16:57,188
Go. Go now.

332
00:16:57,222 --> 00:16:58,856
Before I beg you to stay.

333
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:08,999
Yup.

334
00:17:10,702 --> 00:17:13,770
Please welcome
an insane dictator

335
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:18,041
And one heck
of a bowler, emperor Nikolai!

336
00:17:20,411 --> 00:17:22,646
Thanks, Nixon.
How we doing?

337
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,013
I love you, your majesty!

338
00:17:24,048 --> 00:17:25,648
Shut up, madam ambassador.

339
00:17:25,683 --> 00:17:26,983
I know it.

340
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:28,351
Anyhow...

341
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:32,790
I'd now like to digress
from my prepared remarks

342
00:17:32,824 --> 00:17:34,291
To say I'm done.

343
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,696
Ladies and gentlemen,
this robot is an impostor!

344
00:17:44,736 --> 00:17:46,670
I shall enjoy this.

345
00:17:46,704 --> 00:17:48,172
Not me!

346
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:50,073
Oh, no!

347
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:52,142
That devil, basil,
will kill our emperor.

348
00:17:52,177 --> 00:17:54,678
You're robo-Hungarian?

349
00:17:54,713 --> 00:17:58,115
Yes. Our nation's chief export
is carnies.

350
00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:01,285
If only there were some way
I could get to the u.N. To help.

351
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,787
There is.

352
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:04,122
Get in, Nonchalanto.

353
00:18:04,156 --> 00:18:06,123
Bertha, no!
It would kill you!

354
00:18:06,158 --> 00:18:09,127
I have not so much
time left anyhow.

355
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:10,895
But you could get a new body.

356
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:13,297
You could have a rich,
full life!

357
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:17,067
<i>I am trying
to have a rich, full life.</i>

358
00:18:22,173 --> 00:18:24,875
Long live robo-Hungary!

359
00:18:34,887 --> 00:18:36,821
Me! Thank God you've come!

360
00:18:38,457 --> 00:18:42,694
This is for
big Bertha! Wah!

361
00:18:42,729 --> 00:18:46,332
That is not what I meant
to give you for big Bertha.

362
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,670
That was nice.

363
00:18:50,705 --> 00:18:52,206
Oh, yeah.

364
00:18:58,414 --> 00:19:01,316
Hey, stop kicking me around!

365
00:19:09,891 --> 00:19:11,258
Whoever you are,

366
00:19:11,293 --> 00:19:14,295
You're the bravest robot
I've ever seen.

367
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:16,297
I like killing brave things.

368
00:19:16,332 --> 00:19:19,668
Good, 'cause I've got 20 of them
per cubic meter.

369
00:19:23,907 --> 00:19:27,209
When I grow up,
I want to be
a diplomat!

370
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:34,249
Well, if there's one thing
I've learned, it's a lesson.

371
00:19:34,283 --> 00:19:35,884
I believe this belongs to you.

372
00:19:37,387 --> 00:19:40,155
I shall sell it to
help the common folk,

373
00:19:40,189 --> 00:19:41,923
Now that I understand
their misery.

374
00:19:41,957 --> 00:19:43,692
Yeah, good luck with that.

375
00:19:43,726 --> 00:19:46,895
I must say, Hermes,
you've got a smoking hot body.

376
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:48,997
I was inspired by Amy.

377
00:19:49,032 --> 00:19:51,300
Wow! How'd
you do it?

378
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:53,669
Well, there I was at Elzar's

379
00:19:53,704 --> 00:19:55,004
Eating a nice pork sundae,

380
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:57,340
And suddenly,
I just lost my appetite.

381
00:19:57,374 --> 00:20:00,209
Forever.

382
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:02,312
Q to the e to the d.

383
00:20:02,346 --> 00:20:03,880
So it is possible

384
00:20:03,915 --> 00:20:06,884
For us all to get back
to our original bodies?

385
00:20:06,918 --> 00:20:08,719
Stone-cold munchin', prof.

386
00:20:08,753 --> 00:20:11,755
Sweet Clyde, characterize
your inversion theorem.

387
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:14,892
Basically, no matter
how permuted-up your minds are,

388
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:18,996
They can be restored using,
at most, two extra players.

389
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:23,466
And they say pure math
has no real-world applications!

390
00:20:31,876 --> 00:20:33,744
Everybody back in their zones?

391
00:20:35,346 --> 00:20:38,816
Ah, my body may be old,
but it is mine.

392
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:40,451
Brilliant work, Clyde!

393
00:20:40,485 --> 00:20:44,155
You'll win the NBA's highest
academic honor for this!

394
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:46,858
Also, I'm making you a Duke.

395
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:49,194
So long, filthy commoners!

396
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:50,762
Adios.

397
00:20:52,232 --> 00:20:54,400
And I'm left with
the real jewels safely inside...

398
00:20:54,434 --> 00:20:57,036
<i>His compartment?! Oh!</i>

399
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,939
<i>All right, listen up.
I'll need accomplices.</i>

400
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:01,064
