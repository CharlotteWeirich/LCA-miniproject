Some breaking, involving the dolly.
That's all we know.

- We'll use the backup.
- I'll load pillows.

No way. You disobeyed an order...

160

...so now you have to hand-deliver
all 40 pillows.

161
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,364
I have a serious question.

162
00:12:56,613 --> 00:12:59,525
Does the company that
made your bra do girdles?

- Just get to work!

- I'm Leela. Get to work.
- I agree.

165
00:13:09,293 --> 00:13:13,206
The point is, it's just so
humiliating working for him.

166
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:16,645
Once he actually ordered me to...

167
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:21,125
...shave his armpits while
he was in the tub. So, l...

This is Leela's fault.

If she let us use the backup,
we'd have broken it and given up.

177

A good captain needs many skills...

...like boldness, daring,
and a velour uniform.

I'm not convinced

Leela's not too bad.
She just makes us work so much.

When I was captain,
I only wanted my men's Ioyalty.

If I had that,
I didn't care if they...

Failure to prevent a mutiny.
Throw her in the brig.

- What brig?
- Then the laundry room...

...which will hereafter
be called the "brig. "

195

- Right, genius.

- Didn't I do well?
- You were mean. You yelled.

- You made us work.
- A captain needs to do that.

- I thought we were friends.
- Well...

199

- Don't worry.

on this and laugh.

still fits...

- Put them in the laundry brig.

- Do I have your Ioyalty?
- To the ends of the universe.

No. You're Ioyal enough.
Meanwhile, I have a plan.

00:16:08,213 --> 00:16:11,967
We'll attack our archenemy,
the Neutral Planet.

- Oh, geez.
- Once the threat is gone...

211
00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:19,532
...I'll be a hero and
the DOOP will reinstate me.

00:16:19,773 --> 00:16:24,210
- Sir, that plan makes no sense.
- Maybe not to you.
