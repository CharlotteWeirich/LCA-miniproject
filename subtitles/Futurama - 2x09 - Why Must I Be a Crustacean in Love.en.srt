Gee. Yeah, I'm just going through a

I'm sorry. You're just

They were giant claws with bodies.

00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:41,291
My stink gland is weak. Smell!

120
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,331
You gotta fake like you're in love.

121
00:09:45,573 --> 00:09:48,610
Look in her eyes, start crying...

122
00:09:48,813 --> 00:09:51,646
...and say, "I've never been so happy. "

123
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:54,612
If a guy ever did that, I'd know it.

124
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:57,651
Wait a second. They've all done that.

126
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:06,881
This "love" intrigues me.
Teach me to fake it!

127
00:10:07,693 --> 00:10:10,287
You're on a date.
What do you do?

128
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:13,491
- Ask her to mate.
- Say she's special.

129
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:17,322
She's not. She just has
the largest clutch of eggs.

130
00:10:17,613 --> 00:10:19,888
- Well, tell her that. Then?
- Then mating.

131
00:10:20,173 --> 00:10:23,529
No. Make up feelings
and tell her you have them.

132
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:28,403
- Is "desire to mate" a feeling?
- You're not even trying!

133
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:34,013
It's all so complicated.
The romance and the lies upon lies.

134
00:10:34,253 --> 00:10:38,610
Don't worry. The love meister
will take you under his wing.

I don't know.

You just want to talk.

I just want to talk.

142
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,250
That doesn't make sense.

143
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:06,525
That doesn't make sense. But okay.

144
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:08,849
Tell her she looks thin.

145
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:12,842
You seem malnourished.
Do you suffer from parasites?

146
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:15,089
Yes. Thanks for noticing.

147
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:18,285
- Ask about her day.
- Why would I care?

148
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:21,212
- You wouldn't. Ask.
- How was your day?

149
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:25,611
Well, first I got up
and had a piece of toast.

150
00:11:25,813 --> 00:11:28,407
Then I went to the store. And...

151
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:30,684
Look, she won't shut up.

152
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:33,771
It's normal.
Just nod and say, "Uh-huh. "

153
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:37,489
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- And then you threw an octopus.

154
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:41,766
It's crazy,
but when you talk this way...

155

...your obvious deficiencies seem
less obvious.

156
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:50,603
Your genes seem less detrimental.
You even stink more.

157
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:52,963
- Ask to mate?
- Third date.

158
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:57,886
So I returned his artificial heart.

159
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:01,324
Since then,
I've been called "Honest Bender. "

160
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:07,446
"I'd like to propose a toast to
coat check number 84. "

161
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,446
- Turn it over.
- Oh. "Edna!

162
00:12:10,693 --> 00:12:14,447
Of all the gross crab monsters
on this planet...

163
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:16,723
...you are the hottest. "

164
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:17,963
Oy.

165
00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:21,529
- That's the most beautiful thing.
- Yes. Well...

166
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:25,004
...excuse me. I must powder my flaps.

167
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:27,202
Me too.

168
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:31,247
I'm confused. I'm feeling
a strange new emotion.

169
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:35,003
Is it love when you care for a female
for reasons beyond mating?

170
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:37,648
No. Must be some alien emotion.

171
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:43,249
He said some dumb stuff.
He's a nice guy. Really.

172
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:47,042
Fry's been telling him what
to say. And Fry's a...

173
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:50,285
- Do you have idiots on your planet?
- Fry?

174
00:12:50,573 --> 00:12:55,328
Words of such beauty came from
the blowhole of that hideous alien?

175
00:12:55,613 --> 00:12:56,841
Yeah. What?

176
00:12:57,093 --> 00:13:02,292
Look, never mind the words.
Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor, honey.

177
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,246
EDNA:
Come in.

178
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:23,967
Hello, Fry.

179
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:28,326
Can I interest you
in some surf and turf?

180
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:33,767
I came to tell you that Zoidberg's
great. He's got jelly out the wazoo.

181
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:37,250
That is where it comes out.
It's not everything.

182
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:40,286
I know Zoidberg's words were yours.

183
00:13:40,573 --> 00:13:44,725
Teach me to love,
you squishy poet from beyond!

184
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:51,483
I'm flattered. If I did it
with a mud bug, you'd top the list.

185
00:13:51,773 --> 00:13:56,289
Hush, you romantic fool.
Engage your mandibles and kiss me.

186
00:14:03,773 --> 00:14:07,766
Edna? I couldn't stand
it any longer. L...

187
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:12,291
Fry!

188
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,724
It's not how it looks!

189
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:18,447
- Her caviar is on your neck!
- But...

190
00:14:18,693 --> 00:14:22,049
It's true, Zoidberg.
We can't hide it any longer.

191
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:25,046
We're in love,
and we're mating tomorrow!

192
00:14:25,293 --> 00:14:29,730
- What?!
- Fry! I challenge you to Claw Plock!

193
00:14:31,493 --> 00:14:34,883
- English, please?
- A fight to the death!

194
00:14:36,013 --> 00:14:39,562
And if you survive,
we'll make sweet love.

195
00:14:47,693 --> 00:14:49,843
The law is clear.

196
00:14:50,093 --> 00:14:55,292
Fry and Zoidberg shall fight
to the death for the beautiful Edna.

197
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,809
But I don't want her!

198
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:01,562
The tradition of Claw Plock
can't be taken back.

199
00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:06,881
It is a recent tradition, only
1 8 years old, but it is a tradition.

200
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:22,244
I'm going to rip your swim bladder
out and show it to you!

201
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:25,963
This is madness!
You're being irrational!

202
00:15:26,253 --> 00:15:29,290
- Of course I am. I'm in love!
- Aw.

203
00:15:29,573 --> 00:15:31,245
- Leela!
- Right, right.

204
00:15:31,493 --> 00:15:33,324
You have to stop this.

205
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:35,968
Listen, lady. As you can see...

206
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:40,007
...I'm a highly desirable male
groaning with jelly.

207
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:44,331
Yet I embrace celibacy
to uphold our crazy traditions.

208
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:49,004
- One of your friends must die.
- Fate is cruel and unyielding.

209
00:15:49,213 --> 00:15:51,522
And what must be, must be.

210
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:56,051
Taking bets! 9-to-2 on Zoidberg,
the crab with the jab!

211
00:15:56,293 --> 00:15:59,091
The Great Red Hope! Come on, baby!

212
00:15:59,373 --> 00:16:02,445
It's been years since medical school.
Remind me:

213
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:06,288
- Disemboweling you, fatal or not?
- Fatal.

214
00:16:06,573 --> 00:16:08,848
Large bet on me in round one!

215
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:13,445
Edna, have you anything to say
before begins the Claw Plock?

216
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:17,766
I do. Today I got up
and I had a piece of toast...

217
00:16:17,973 --> 00:16:19,804
...then I brushed my teeth...

218
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:22,687
- Shut up!
- I love you, Fry!

219
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:24,406
No!

220
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:28,963
Having guessed what animal
I was thinking of...

221
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:32,085
...you have first choice of weapon.

222
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:42,606
- And you, doctor?
- I choose my claws.

223
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:46,448
I want to chop him here,
in the gonads.

224
00:16:46,693 --> 00:16:48,285
Nobody correct him.

225
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:52,765
Fry, I've never asked
for anything before... .

226
00:16:52,973 --> 00:16:56,602
When it comes to the ninth round,
let him win.

227
00:16:56,893 --> 00:17:02,013
- It's a fight to the death!
- Suddenly it's all about you! Sheesh.

228
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:05,205
Please rise for the national anthem.

229
00:17:08,453 --> 00:17:09,602
Uh-oh.

230
00:17:10,853 --> 00:17:14,084
Let Claw Plock begin!

231
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:54,568
Go, Fry! Die with dignity!

232
00:17:57,893 --> 00:17:59,008
Oops!

233
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:06,769
No! I can't stand to look!

234
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,606
What?

235
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:16,125
Fry! Take a dive!

236
00:18:18,773 --> 00:18:21,367
Claw Plock! Claw Plock!

237
00:18:21,653 --> 00:18:26,010
Claw Plock! Claw Plock! Claw Plock!

238
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:33,812
Fellow fish monsters, I don't want to
question your stupid civilization...

239
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:38,689
...but will killing someone
with a nutcracker solve anything?

240
00:18:38,973 --> 00:18:43,251
He's my friend. Though a woman
has come between us...

241
00:18:43,453 --> 00:18:45,284
...we'll remain friends.

242
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:48,491
And do you know why? One reason.

243
00:18:52,293 --> 00:18:56,002
You bastard! I'll kill you!
You bastard!

244
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:07,044
Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone!

245
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,563
Edna? Honey?

246
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:17,242
Edna?

247
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:27,251
Oh, my God!

248
00:19:27,493 --> 00:19:29,051
The frenzy!

249
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:34,492
Oh, the greatest experience
in life and I missed it.

250
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:37,769
I'm sorry, doc.

251
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:49,049
The frenzy is over.
How will I get rid of my jelly now?

252
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,449
- I'll lend you this.
- Fry.

253
00:19:51,653 --> 00:19:54,326
- Hey!
- Shoo! Get away. Hey!

254
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,202
What's with the flying jerks?

255
00:19:57,453 --> 00:19:59,887
They feast after the frenzy.

256
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:03,529
Once my species passes
its genes, it dies.

257
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:08,410
You choose between
life without sex and death?

258
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:10,251
- Yes.
- Tough call.

259
00:20:13,293 --> 00:20:16,285
It was nice of you
to let me fix your arm.

260
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:19,804
Especially after I made
an eel out of myself.

261
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,242
- No biggie.
- Yes, biggie.

262
00:20:21,493 --> 00:20:24,291
I felt things I never felt before:

263
00:20:24,493 --> 00:20:27,849
Love, jealousy,
passion for disemboweling.

264
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,890
I owe it all to you.

265
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:33,851
I pronounce the operation a success.

266
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,328
- Hooray!
- Yeah!

267
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:41,209
I don't know emotions.
But medicine, forget about it.

268
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:46,049
Not to nitpick, doc, but
could you take one more whack at this?

269
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:48,932
For you, my friend, anything.

270
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:53,044
FRY: <i>Ahh! My legs! </i>
ZOIDBERG: <i>All right... </i>

271
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,443
<i>Third time's the charm. </i>
