1
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,678
Earth. Fire.

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,949
Air. Water.

3
00:00:14,951 --> 00:00:18,953
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements...

4
00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:20,501
And bring balance to the world.

5
00:00:20,532 --> 00:00:26,094
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by</font> <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

6
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:28,646
So much has changed these past three years.

7
00:00:28,648 --> 00:00:31,182
Mako is a bodyguard for
the future earth king,

8
00:00:31,184 --> 00:00:33,217
Prince Wu, while Bolin works for Kuvira,

9
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:35,252
the earth kingdom's interim leader who has

10
00:00:35,254 --> 00:00:37,555
brought stability to a
nation plagued by chaos.

11
00:00:37,557 --> 00:00:40,257
Meanwhile, after wandering the
world trying to heal herself,

12
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:43,127
a spirit led Korra to the swamp,
where she met Toph Beifong.

13
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:45,329
Will this earthbending master be the key

14
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:46,869
to Korra regaining her Avatar mojo?

15
00:00:46,888 --> 00:00:50,297
__

16
00:00:53,572 --> 00:00:55,172
So then the crowds are gathered,

17
00:00:55,174 --> 00:00:56,741
all excited to see my coronation,

18
00:00:56,743 --> 00:00:59,910
when all of a sudden, these
boulders come rolling through.

19
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:03,614
And guess what pops out
of 'em? Earthbender dames!

20
00:01:03,616 --> 00:01:06,183
These gals start banging
the boulders like drums

21
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:08,152
and sing the song of my royal lineage.

22
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:11,255
It's the most dynamite
six-hour show you've ever seen

23
00:01:11,257 --> 00:01:12,423
in your life.

24
00:01:12,425 --> 00:01:15,259
Shouldn't you be getting
ready to... I don't know...

25
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:16,394
rule the whole nation?

26
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:18,696
Now, now, now. Don't
get yourself in a tizzy.

27
00:01:18,698 --> 00:01:20,931
I'll have ministers for all that.

28
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:23,567
No sir, Mako. When we get to Ba Sing Se,

29
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:28,472
it'll just be two kooky
pals livin' the life!

30
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:30,541
Yay...

31
00:01:30,543 --> 00:01:31,909
Getting excited for your big day?

32
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:34,512
Does a platypus bear poop in... hey!

33
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:35,714
You can't put bleachers there!

34
00:01:35,738 --> 00:01:38,682
There won't be enough room for
the dance of the badgermoles!

35
00:01:38,684 --> 00:01:42,219
Look, it's gonna go like this.

36
00:01:42,221 --> 00:01:45,389
You sure that's the guy you
want running the earth kingdom?

37
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:46,991
Trust me. We'll be sending a delegation

38
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:50,227
of experienced advisers to
handle day-to-day governing.

39
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:52,830
I see the prince is becoming accustomed to

40
00:01:52,832 --> 00:01:54,565
the burdens of leadership.

41
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:56,801
You know royals. They love a ceremony.

42
00:01:56,803 --> 00:01:59,570
Have you received any word
on the Avatar's location?

43
00:01:59,572 --> 00:02:02,506
Not yet, but I have
airbenders all over the world

44
00:02:02,508 --> 00:02:03,841
on the lookout for her.

45
00:02:03,843 --> 00:02:05,476
I hope they find her soon.

46
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:06,958
I'm concerned about reports I've heard

47
00:02:06,982 --> 00:02:09,780
regarding Kuvira's growing military.

48
00:02:09,782 --> 00:02:12,450
They say she's throwing
some of her dissenters

49
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:13,417
into prison camps.

50
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:15,019
Well, she'll be stepping down tomorrow.

51
00:02:15,043 --> 00:02:17,955
We can worry about correcting
any of her mistakes after that.

52
00:02:17,957 --> 00:02:19,277
And you're not worried about her

53
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:20,724
handing power over to Prince Wu?

54
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:22,927
When Kuvira started cleaning
up the earth kingdom,

55
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:25,029
she knew her position wasn't permanent.

56
00:02:25,031 --> 00:02:28,365
She gave me her word that she'd step down.

57
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:32,837
Still, I'd feel a lot
better if Korra were here.

58
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:39,877
You've gotta help me get back
into Avatar fighting shape.

59
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:40,919
I'm getting my butt kicked

60
00:02:40,943 --> 00:02:43,781
by losers all over the earth kingdom.

61
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:45,216
The world needs me.

62
00:02:45,218 --> 00:02:46,650
Get over yourself.

63
00:02:46,652 --> 00:02:49,386
The world doesn't need you one bit.

64
00:02:49,388 --> 00:02:51,188
But while I've been
the Avatar, I've stopped

65
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:54,859
some really bad people from
doing some really bad things.

66
00:02:54,861 --> 00:02:59,663
Listen, when I was chief
of police of Republic City,

67
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:02,633
I worked my butt off busting criminals.

68
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:05,703
But did that make crime disappear?

69
00:03:05,705 --> 00:03:06,504
Nope.

70
00:03:06,506 --> 00:03:08,539
If there's one thing I learned on the beat,

71
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:13,477
it's that the names change,
but the street stays the same.

72
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,679
So, basically, you're saying that

73
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:18,849
everything I've ever
accomplished has been pointless.

74
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:21,418
And I thought Beifong was grumpy.

75
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,888
I'm the original Beifong.

76
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,390
So, you're not gonna train me?

77
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:30,227
Well, I was planning on
soaking my feet in mud

78
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:31,295
for a few weeks.

79
00:03:31,297 --> 00:03:32,663
But I can't stand you

80
00:03:32,665 --> 00:03:37,301
being so pathetic and getting
your butt kicked all the time.

81
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:39,904
All right. I guess I can help.

82
00:03:39,906 --> 00:03:42,306
- Thank you!
- Nah-ah-ah-ah.

83
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:45,776
You want to hug something, go hug a tree.

84
00:03:45,778 --> 00:03:49,280
We're here to work.

85
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:54,585
Hello, Republic City!

86
00:03:54,587 --> 00:03:57,521
Bolin is back!

87
00:03:58,023 --> 00:04:00,758
And Eska's also here.

88
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,961
I see you have replaced
me with a new girlfriend.

89
00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:06,997
Well done. She seems very threatening.

90
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:08,632
Oh, no, no. That's Kuvira.

91
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:09,767
She's kind of my boss.

92
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:12,069
Boss. Girlfriend. Same thing.

93
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:14,371
I'm afraid there's been
a mistake, your eminence.

94
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:17,608
We have you and your brother
booked in the same room,

95
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,043
with only one bed.

96
00:04:19,045 --> 00:04:21,752
It's no mistake. Desna sleeps in the tub.

97
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:28,031
Never thought I'd be allowed back in

98
00:04:28,055 --> 00:04:29,687
the Republic City four elements.

99
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:30,849
Raiko must have turned purple

100
00:04:30,873 --> 00:04:33,791
when Kuvira made him pardon
me of my alleged crimes.

101
00:04:33,793 --> 00:04:36,627
You're an upstanding citizen again, sir.

102
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:38,829
Upstanding is right! And don't forget to

103
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:41,465
fill the extra bag with as
many of those little soaps

104
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:45,536
as you can grab. Love the lavender scent.

105
00:04:47,405 --> 00:04:49,440
Bolin!

106
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:52,743
Look at you!

107
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:56,347
My little brother got all... Important.

108
00:04:56,349 --> 00:04:57,014
I know, right?

109
00:04:57,016 --> 00:04:58,482
I see myself in the mirror sometimes,

110
00:04:58,484 --> 00:05:00,204
and I think I'm in
trouble before I realize,

111
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:00,985
it's only me.

112
00:05:00,987 --> 00:05:03,854
So... What's it like working for Kuvira?

113
00:05:03,856 --> 00:05:05,856
From what I've heard, she's pretty harsh.

114
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:07,691
No! I mean, she can be tough, sure,

115
00:05:07,693 --> 00:05:09,593
but we're turning around the earth kingdom

116
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:10,661
like you wouldn't believe.

117
00:05:10,663 --> 00:05:14,531
You remember how bad grandma's
neighborhood in Ba Sing Se was?

118
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:15,733
All that's completely changed.

119
00:05:15,757 --> 00:05:17,368
I mean, we are really... Helping people.

120
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,970
But what have you been up to?
Fighting crime? Busting triads?

121
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:22,906
Chasing the ladies, Mako style?

122
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:26,610
Well, I've been working for Wu.

123
00:05:30,012 --> 00:05:34,518
And, uh... Yeah.

124
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,986
So have you seen Korra yet?

125
00:05:35,988 --> 00:05:38,522
No. She was supposed
to come in with Tonraq,

126
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:41,392
but he says she left the
south pole months ago.

127
00:05:41,394 --> 00:05:44,395
No one knows where she is.

128
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,398
Mother.

129
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,999
Hello, Baatar junior.

130
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:51,035
It's just "Baatar" now.

131
00:05:51,037 --> 00:05:53,604
So, now that you've seen
all the good we've done

132
00:05:53,606 --> 00:05:55,939
since we left Zaofu, you must be sorry that

133
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:57,174
you didn't come and help us.

134
00:05:57,176 --> 00:06:00,110
I don't know if I'd call marching
all over the earth kingdom,

135
00:06:00,112 --> 00:06:03,747
forcing people to bow
to Kuvira, "doing good."

136
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:06,316
You're going to have to get
over your grudge with her.

137
00:06:06,318 --> 00:06:08,585
I'm sure you've heard that we're engaged.

138
00:06:08,587 --> 00:06:10,854
She's going to be an
official member of our family.

139
00:06:10,856 --> 00:06:14,491
I'm just glad that she'll be
stepping down after tomorrow.

140
00:06:14,493 --> 00:06:17,928
You prefer to be ruled by that royal idiot?

141
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,131
I hope I'm not out of order saying this...

142
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:25,469
You're pretty easy on the
eyes for a military type.

143
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:28,105
I'll put in a good word for
you with the hotel staff,

144
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:29,347
maybe get you a little upgrade.

145
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:31,909
I've been living here
for years. They love me.

146
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:33,610
I won't be needing your help.

147
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:35,092
We've reserved the presidential suite.

148
00:06:35,116 --> 00:06:37,815
Well, I think someone is
pulling your chain, gumdrop.

149
00:06:37,817 --> 00:06:40,017
See, I'm in the presidential suite.

150
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:42,986
Not anymore. I had you moved out.

151
00:06:42,988 --> 00:06:45,856
Wait, what? Cam, where's all my stuff?

152
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:49,159
We moved you into a very nice junior suite

153
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:50,527
on the seventh floor.

154
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:51,762
Junior suite?

155
00:06:51,764 --> 00:06:54,898
Something you should know about me...

156
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,769
I always get what I want.

157
00:07:03,408 --> 00:07:06,477
Your royal cabinet is here, your majesty!

158
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,344
Where have you been?

159
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:09,046
My coronation is in ten minutes.

160
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:10,013
Where's everyone else?

161
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:12,135
Where are the seven sacred
chests of exquisite finery?

162
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:14,852
Where are my grandfather's
taffeta pantaloons?

163
00:07:14,854 --> 00:07:17,654
Sadly, most of your servants were scattered

164
00:07:17,656 --> 00:07:21,458
and the royal things were
looted after the queen was...

165
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,126
Removed from office.

166
00:07:22,128 --> 00:07:27,798
So your coronation may not
have some of the usual items...

167
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,133
Like... The crown.

168
00:07:29,135 --> 00:07:30,033
There's no crown?

169
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:32,102
How can you have a
coronation without a crown?

170
00:07:32,104 --> 00:07:34,371
How will people know when
I'm officially the king?

171
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:39,443
We still have one of the
royal jewels we can pin on you.

172
00:07:39,445 --> 00:07:40,077
An earring?

173
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,981
Think of it more as a royal brooch.

174
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:47,918
Are you telling me that there
are no dancing badgermoles?

175
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,119
No acrobat bell-ringers?

176
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:50,788
No horn-blowing
announcer-y guy?

177
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,725
It will be a very simple,
intimate, elegant ceremony.

178
00:07:54,727 --> 00:07:56,860
A wonderful day for your kingdom.

179
00:07:56,862 --> 00:07:58,362
Just try on the brooch, your grace.

180
00:07:58,364 --> 00:08:00,612
You'll see it will look beau... don't...

181
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:02,698
Touch me.

182
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,868
Okay. Bring it.

183
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:24,353
Tell me what you did wrong.

184
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:27,256
Well... I was thinking
that you were gonna...

185
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:28,223
exactly.

186
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:30,693
You were thinking.

187
00:08:30,695 --> 00:08:32,528
Go again.

188
00:08:52,716 --> 00:08:53,482
Pathetic.

189
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:58,420
Of all the avatars I've worked
with, you're by far the worst.

190
00:08:58,422 --> 00:09:02,124
I know that's only one
other Avatar, but still.

191
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:03,058
Ah! Hey!

192
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,594
It seems like you're
enjoying having someone around

193
00:09:05,596 --> 00:09:06,695
to beat up an awful lot.

194
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:11,166
Yeah, the swampbenders out
here really can't take a punch.

195
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:13,902
So... What made you want to drop out

196
00:09:13,904 --> 00:09:15,544
and disconnect from the rest of the world?

197
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:19,808
I'm more connected to the
world than you've ever been.

198
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:24,246
The roots and vines...
they run all over the world.

199
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:29,385
I can see Su and Lin,
Zaofu and Republic City...

200
00:09:29,387 --> 00:09:33,889
I see everything.

201
00:09:37,428 --> 00:09:40,896
You're blind compared to me.

202
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,036
Now rise, Wu of the Hou-Ting Dynasty,

203
00:09:47,038 --> 00:09:48,904
king of all the earth lands,

204
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:52,341
and glorious defender of Ba Sing Se.

205
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,209
Long may you reign.

206
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:57,212
Go Wu. Woo.

207
00:09:57,214 --> 00:10:01,417
Thank you for that incredibly
brief but very moving ceremony.

208
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:05,320
I am touched by the love
of my devoted countrymen

209
00:10:05,322 --> 00:10:06,255
who have worked so hard

210
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:09,058
to restore their beloved
leader to the throne.

211
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,760
One of them deserves special attention.

212
00:10:11,762 --> 00:10:14,063
Kuvira? Rise.

213
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:19,134
For your service to the realm,
I would like to present you

214
00:10:19,136 --> 00:10:22,071
with the Kyoshi medal of freedom,

215
00:10:22,073 --> 00:10:23,338
our nation's highest honor,

216
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:28,844
which was somehow not stolen,
unlike the royal pinkie rings.

217
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:29,745
Hmph.

218
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:30,512
Thank you.

219
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:33,916
And if you don't mind, I'd
like to say a few words.

220
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:38,320
Why not? We've got six hours to fill.

221
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:42,257
Growing up in Zaofu with Suyin Beifong,

222
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:46,128
I learned that the idea of a
royal family passing a title

223
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,331
from one generation to
the next was archaic,

224
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,967
and that technology
and innovation should be

225
00:10:51,969 --> 00:10:53,268
what drives a nation forward.

226
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,205
It was the pathetic rule of
kings and queens that caused

227
00:10:56,207 --> 00:11:00,342
the earth kingdom to descend
into such incredible disarray.

228
00:11:00,344 --> 00:11:04,513
It's taken me three years
to get it back on track,

229
00:11:04,515 --> 00:11:06,782
and there's no way I will allow it

230
00:11:06,784 --> 00:11:09,384
to slip back into the dark ages.

231
00:11:09,386 --> 00:11:12,754
I'd like to make an
announcement to the world.

232
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,523
The earth kingdom is no more.

233
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:18,994
And from here on out,
this man has no authority.

234
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:20,156
Wait, what?

235
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,498
But I just got the royal brooch.

236
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,467
I have created a new earth empire,

237
00:11:25,469 --> 00:11:29,104
and I will continue to lead
it into the future myself,

238
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:32,975
<i>bringing about a new era
of prosperity for my people.</i>

239
00:11:32,977 --> 00:11:36,411
We love you, Kuvira!

240
00:11:36,413 --> 00:11:41,049
All hail the great uniter!

241
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:46,054
And let me assure my fellow
leaders of one thing...

242
00:11:46,056 --> 00:11:51,727
Anyone who crosses our
borders or stands in our way

243
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:55,297
will be crushed.

244
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:59,034
Thank you, Kuvira!

245
00:11:59,036 --> 00:12:01,370
All hail the great uniter!

246
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:04,306
Worst coronation ever.

247
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,644
Were you surprised? Because
I was really surprised.

248
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:11,180
Won't this turn all the
world leaders against us?

249
00:12:11,182 --> 00:12:12,915
Relax, kid, what can they do?

250
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:14,357
Kuvira controls the whole nation now,

251
00:12:14,381 --> 00:12:18,053
and Republic City is begging
for the metal that we're mining.

252
00:12:18,055 --> 00:12:20,422
This train has left the station,

253
00:12:20,424 --> 00:12:22,858
and we own the track!

254
00:12:26,296 --> 00:12:29,498
Now that's a nice-looking
hunk of spirit vine.

255
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,660
Let's take it back to the lab

256
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:34,085
and get it stabilized immediately.

257
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:40,175
You look worried, Bolin.

258
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,544
Yeah, well... I just have some misgivings

259
00:12:42,546 --> 00:12:46,248
about how you kind of ambushed
Tenzin and the other leaders.

260
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,850
You believe in the work that we've done

261
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:51,186
for the people of the
earth empire, right, Bolin?

262
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,087
I do, but...

263
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:52,988
then stick with me.

264
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,891
I'm going to need your
help now more than ever.

265
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:58,193
Raiko and the other leaders
want to bully us into

266
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:01,363
accepting some idiot
king who will serve them

267
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:02,531
but neglect the people.

268
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,333
We have to stand strong against them.

269
00:13:04,335 --> 00:13:07,970
I'm just not sure about
this whole empire thing.

270
00:13:07,972 --> 00:13:09,905
It seems pretty aggressive.

271
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:11,940
And what was that part about the crushing?

272
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:14,876
That was just some tough
rhetoric to let people know

273
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:15,878
that we mean business.

274
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,615
Believe me, conflict is
the last thing I want.

275
00:13:19,617 --> 00:13:23,118
Will you help me make history, Bolin?

276
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:28,890
Hmm. I'll stand by you.

277
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:29,958
Thank you.

278
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,494
We need to talk.

279
00:13:33,463 --> 00:13:37,799
Can you give us the room, please?

280
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,436
I met with the world leaders,

281
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:43,405
and I've come as their representative.

282
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:47,075
So now you're taking an
interest in world affairs?

283
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,377
A little late, isn't it?

284
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:50,679
When the queen fell and
everyone was asking you

285
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:54,016
to help keep the earth
kingdom from falling apart,

286
00:13:54,018 --> 00:13:56,018
all you wanted to do was hide in Zaofu

287
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,153
and let others deal with the consequences.

288
00:13:58,155 --> 00:14:01,189
That's hardly fair. I
didn't want to seize power

289
00:14:01,191 --> 00:14:03,458
for myself, which is what you've done.

290
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,095
I'm telling you, for the good of everyone,

291
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,563
you have to step down.

292
00:14:08,565 --> 00:14:10,265
<i>I stepped up.</i>

293
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,367
I provide stability and equality.

294
00:14:12,369 --> 00:14:16,972
Tell your world leaders to stay
out of earth empire business.

295
00:14:16,974 --> 00:14:20,342
We won't accept their
hand-picked dictator.

296
00:14:20,344 --> 00:14:22,444
What makes you so different?

297
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:23,612
You're just another tyrant.

298
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:26,214
And don't pretend the
people put you where you are.

299
00:14:26,216 --> 00:14:28,216
I know what happens to
cities who don't want

300
00:14:28,218 --> 00:14:29,418
to hand over control to you.

301
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:34,323
Then you know what's coming for Zaofu.

302
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:40,329
First I lose my suite,
then I lose my throne.

303
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:43,198
My royal brooch is a lie!

304
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,399
I know you must be crushed,

305
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:47,035
not getting to come back
to Ba Sing Se with me.

306
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:50,605
Don't worry about me.
I'll find a way to make it.

307
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:54,409
Good ol' Mako, my big tough guy.

308
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:57,446
Ugh. Okay, I just have to go on,

309
00:14:57,448 --> 00:15:00,615
move forward, take decisive action.

310
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:02,384
Let's go shopping!

311
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:10,225
Ugh. Get rid of him.

312
00:15:10,227 --> 00:15:11,227
He's with her.

313
00:15:11,228 --> 00:15:13,595
He's my brother.

314
00:15:13,597 --> 00:15:15,364
Interesting ceremony, huh?

315
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:17,499
You aren't going to keep working for Kuvira

316
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,101
now that she's going against the wishes

317
00:15:19,103 --> 00:15:20,263
of the entire world, are you?

318
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:23,004
You don't understand. Kuvira is helping out

319
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,639
all the poor people in the earth empire,

320
00:15:24,641 --> 00:15:27,476
people like our family.
This is for the best.

321
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:28,443
I don't know, bro.

322
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:31,113
Okay, why don't you come with
me, and you'll see for yourself?

323
00:15:31,115 --> 00:15:33,515
We've done a lot of good,
and Varrick is working on

324
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,951
some new innovations. We're making history.

325
00:15:35,953 --> 00:15:38,353
By crushing anyone who gets in your way?

326
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,322
That was just some tough rhetoric

327
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:42,624
to let the people know
that we mean business.

328
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:45,460
I mean, Kuvira is
basically just like Korra...

329
00:15:45,462 --> 00:15:46,828
She might seem hard to deal with,

330
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,398
but it's just because she's so passionate

331
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,099
and believes in what she's doing.

332
00:15:51,101 --> 00:15:53,068
It seems like she's just a dictator

333
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,703
who's taking the earth kingdom by force.

334
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,825
Oh, okay, so you think your
new best friend in there

335
00:15:56,849 --> 00:15:59,040
would be a better leader than Kuvira?

336
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,009
- Well, no, but still...
- still what?

337
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:03,178
Come on, Mako, I'm making
a difference out there.

338
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,246
What are you doin', huh?

339
00:16:04,248 --> 00:16:06,148
You're just some glorified Butler

340
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,116
for some snotty, rich bozo.

341
00:16:08,118 --> 00:16:09,584
I'm sorry. I don't want to work for

342
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:13,321
your glorious emperor in
her military dictatorship.

343
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:14,156
Fine!

344
00:16:14,158 --> 00:16:15,638
I'm gonna go back to my awesome train,

345
00:16:15,662 --> 00:16:17,459
where we bring freedom wherever we go.

346
00:16:17,461 --> 00:16:23,198
<i>Enjoy licking the king's
boots in your junior suite!</i>

347
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:31,273
Sorry, sport. I heard it all.

348
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:32,307
Can't believe him!

349
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:35,343
I know! Insulting another man's suite?

350
00:16:35,345 --> 00:16:36,211
It's beneath low.

351
00:16:36,213 --> 00:16:38,346
But I think I know what
would cheer you up...

352
00:16:38,348 --> 00:16:41,349
A visit to little Ba Sing Se fashion mall!

353
00:16:41,351 --> 00:16:42,684
I'll buy you a smoothie.

354
00:16:42,686 --> 00:16:45,654
Yeah. Okay.

355
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,556
That was terrible.

356
00:16:47,558 --> 00:16:49,191
Ha! Maybe for you.

357
00:16:49,193 --> 00:16:50,358
I had a great time!

358
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,729
I never realized how much I
missed tormenting the Avatar.

359
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:57,065
I wish you were putting up more of a fight.

360
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:58,033
But it was still fun.

361
00:16:58,035 --> 00:17:02,137
You were tossing me around
like a rag doll all day long.

362
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:05,974
I know! And I'm an old lady.

363
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:07,742
Imagine me in my prime.

364
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:11,947
Ha-ha! I would have destroyed you!

365
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:14,749
I just don't understand
why I can't get back

366
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,852
to my former self. It's like...

367
00:17:16,854 --> 00:17:19,120
I'm a step slower. I'm tentative.

368
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:19,821
I'm out of sync.

369
00:17:19,823 --> 00:17:21,656
I just can't get back in the groove.

370
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:24,326
Probably carrying around
that metal doesn't help.

371
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:25,193
What metal?

372
00:17:25,195 --> 00:17:28,830
The little bits of metal
poison stuck in your body.

373
00:17:28,832 --> 00:17:32,100
Are you trying to tell
me you can't feel metal

374
00:17:32,102 --> 00:17:33,201
in your own body?

375
00:17:33,203 --> 00:17:36,104
You really are the worst Avatar ever.

376
00:17:36,106 --> 00:17:37,439
I thought Su got it all out.

377
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:40,475
No, my girls never really
picked up metalbending

378
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:41,943
all that well, if you ask me.

379
00:17:41,945 --> 00:17:45,080
That's been my problem this entire time!

380
00:17:45,082 --> 00:17:45,814
I gotta get it out.

381
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:47,449
You can get it out for me, right?

382
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:50,585
Who do you think you're talking to?

383
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:55,257
Once we're done with these,
we can go into the middle ring

384
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:56,859
and I'll let you pick out some new suits.

385
00:17:56,883 --> 00:18:01,685
Then we'll hit the boutiques
in the upper ring for me.

386
00:18:05,268 --> 00:18:07,302
Where did you get those shirts?

387
00:18:07,304 --> 00:18:09,538
Aces, right? Kuvira is my hero.

388
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,440
They're selling them over there.

389
00:18:15,812 --> 00:18:17,312
You can't sell that junk in here!

390
00:18:17,314 --> 00:18:19,414
This is the little Ba Sing Se fashion mall,

391
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,049
and I'm the little king here!

392
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:21,750
Respect the brooch!

393
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:26,121
Stop it, little king!

394
00:18:26,123 --> 00:18:29,324
I am the glorious defender!

395
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,427
I'm covered in juice! Get him!

396
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:34,529
We need to get you out of here.

397
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,498
Ooh!

398
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,686
It's destiny!

399
00:18:57,688 --> 00:19:00,322
Look where we are, Mako...

400
00:19:00,324 --> 00:19:03,391
The royal palace.

401
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:09,531
The throne!

402
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:12,267
Out of my way!

403
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:14,569
Hey! It's my birthday!

404
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:15,704
It's my coronation day!

405
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:17,272
You'll have another birthday next year,

406
00:19:17,274 --> 00:19:20,442
but I'll never have this day back again!

407
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:21,843
Never!

408
00:19:21,845 --> 00:19:23,612
Okay, you're losing it.

409
00:19:23,614 --> 00:19:27,515
This is the worst day of my life!

410
00:19:27,517 --> 00:19:29,751
Why?

411
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,419
Do you really want to be the king?

412
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:33,755
I mean, Kuvira might be
a power-crazed dictator,

413
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:36,324
but at least she spent the
last few years working hard

414
00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:37,966
to make the earth kingdom somewhat better.

415
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,494
If you were an earth kingdom citizen,

416
00:19:39,496 --> 00:19:42,530
do you think you're the kind
of person you want as your king?

417
00:19:42,532 --> 00:19:46,768
What have you ever done for your people?

418
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,771
I'm sorry. That was out of line.

419
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,272
No. You're right.

420
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,508
No one ever talked to me like that before.

421
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:58,279
I guess I'm just a joke
who got what he deserved.

422
00:19:58,714 --> 00:20:02,317
Let's get you out of here
and back to some place safe.

423
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:04,252
- Carry me?
- No.

424
00:20:04,254 --> 00:20:07,656
Okay. If you want me
to bend out this metal,

425
00:20:07,658 --> 00:20:09,357
you need to relax.

426
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,292
<i>I am relaxed.</i>

427
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,394
Ha! Seriously?

428
00:20:12,396 --> 00:20:15,063
Your body is like a twisted tree trunk.

429
00:20:15,065 --> 00:20:18,633
Just do it! I'm ready!

430
00:20:30,547 --> 00:20:33,348
It wouldn't hurt if you would just relax!

431
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,783
Stop fighting me!

432
00:20:34,785 --> 00:20:38,386
I'm not fighting!

433
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,466
Ya! All right, that's it.

434
00:20:51,468 --> 00:20:53,668
You're going to have to do this yourself.

435
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,905
Clearly, you want to
keep the metal in there.

436
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:57,939
What do you mean?

437
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:00,308
Why would I want poison inside me?

438
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,344
I don't know. Maybe so you have an excuse

439
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,180
not to go back to being the Avatar.

440
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:07,182
If you don't get better,
you can't do your job,

441
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:10,952
so you don't have to worry
about getting hurt again.

442
00:21:10,954 --> 00:21:13,054
What? That's ridiculous.

443
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:15,790
Whatever. When you want it out,

444
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:16,858
you can bend it out.

445
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,928
I can't deal with all your issues for you.

446
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,665
Wait! What am I supposed to do now?

447
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:24,599
How should I know?

448
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:26,534
Ask the spirit that brought you here.

449
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:30,538
The good news is, if you're
looking for a place to hang

450
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,040
where no one will bother you,

451
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:36,911
you picked the best swamp in the world!

452
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:40,715
This is a mission of the utmost importance.

453
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,884
Conflict is coming to the earth kingdom,

454
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,019
and we need to find the Avatar.

455
00:21:45,021 --> 00:21:49,457
Can I count on you three
to bring Korra home?

456
00:21:49,459 --> 00:21:51,760
You can count on one of us.

457
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:56,231
I don't know about these two ladies.

458
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,880
From now on, developing this technology is

459
00:22:11,882 --> 00:22:13,414
your number one priority.

460
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,287
This is going to change everything.

461
