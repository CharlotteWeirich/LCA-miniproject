1
00:00:07,453 --> 00:00:09,364  X1:224 X2:491 Y1:495 Y2:516
The Route of All Evil

2
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:39,002  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:061 Y2:121
Ah, beer. So many choices.
And it makes so little difference.

3
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:41,243  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:061 Y2:121
How about Lobrau?
It has dots on it.

4
00:00:41,453 --> 00:00:45,446  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:061 Y2:121
Overruled! The choice of champions
is Pabst Blue Robot.

5
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:48,571  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:061 Y2:127
I can't drink that. The metal
shavings make my throat bloody.

6
00:00:49,613 --> 00:00:51,649  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:061 Y2:087
Baby wants a Zima.

7
00:00:51,813 --> 00:00:54,805  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:061 Y2:121
Hey, hey. We can all fight
when we're drunk.

8
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,004  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:516
Listen, why don't
we just brew our own beer?

9
00:00:57,213 --> 00:00:58,646  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:490 Y2:516
You can brew your own beer?

10
00:00:58,853 --> 00:01:01,845  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:061 Y2:121
Sure. The kids at the orphanarium
used to do it all the time.

11
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:11,610  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:061 Y2:126
Cursed bacteria of Liberia! My own son,
suspended from boarding school.

12
00:01:11,813 --> 00:01:14,008  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:450 Y2:516
- It's not my fault, Dad.
- And you, Cubert.

13
00:01:14,213 --> 00:01:18,286  X1:101 X2:613 Y1:061 Y2:126
I cloned you from one of my warts,
and I can send you straight back there.

14
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:23,042  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:061 Y2:127
What's going on? Is this angry
yelling, or busted-hearing-aid yelling?

15
00:01:23,253 --> 00:01:24,811  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:061 Y2:122
- I'm afraid it's both.
- What?

16
00:01:24,973 --> 00:01:27,407  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:061 Y2:126
Now, hold on.
Everyone cool your daiquiris.

17
00:01:27,573 --> 00:01:30,451  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:061 Y2:127
Let's give the little vermin a chance
to explain themselves.

18
00:01:30,653 --> 00:01:35,408  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:451 Y2:516
It was self-defense, Mom. Just look
at this letter the principal sent.

19
00:01:37,213 --> 00:01:38,487  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:061 Y2:082
We were in science class...

20
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:41,167  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:061 Y2:121
...and we had finished building
a miniature black hole.

21
00:01:41,373 --> 00:01:44,206  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:061 Y2:126
- That was easy.
- Pretty scrawny black hole.

22
00:01:44,373 --> 00:01:46,682  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:061 Y2:087
It must be hungry.

23
00:01:46,853 --> 00:01:50,163  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:061 Y2:122
- Black holes don't need food.
- Neither do nerds.

24
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:55,207  X1:272 X2:444 Y1:490 Y2:516
My Manwich!

25
00:01:57,253 --> 00:01:59,926  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:061 Y2:127
That's it. You've compressed
our lunches to a singularity...

26
00:02:00,093 --> 00:02:03,563  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:061 Y2:087
...for the last time. Salt him, Dwight.

27
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:10,529  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:450 Y2:516
When I re-solidify, I'm gonna put you
in a world of goop.

28
00:02:12,253 --> 00:02:15,131  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:451 Y2:516
See? That bully started it.
We couldn't fight back with brawn...

29
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:19,445  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:451 Y2:516
...so we used our brains.
- I warned you not to use those things!

30
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:24,406  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:516
Let's see. We've got our malt.
Our hops.

31
00:02:24,573 --> 00:02:27,292  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:456 Y2:516
We just need a big disposable tub
to mix it in.

32
00:02:31,893 --> 00:02:35,329  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:451 Y2:516
Now it needs to boil
for a couple hours.

33
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,211  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Dwight, you remember the crew?
- Yeah.

34
00:02:42,373 --> 00:02:45,331  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Crew, you remember Cubert?
- Yeah.

35
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,649  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:451 Y2:516
Wonderful!
Then I'm sure you won't mind...

36
00:02:47,813 --> 00:02:51,692  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:456 Y2:516
...being their legal guardians
for a month.

37
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:57,368  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:453 Y2:516
Well, well, if it isn't my old friends,
Stretch Pants, No Pants...

38
00:02:57,533 --> 00:02:59,842  X1:283 X2:433 Y1:495 Y2:516
...and Idiot.

39
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:04,086  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:450 Y2:516
- We're making beer. I'm the brewery.
- I heard alcohol makes you stupid.

40
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:07,683  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:450 Y2:516
- No, I'm... Doesn't.
- Actually, Dwight, you're right.

41
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:12,768  X1:104 X2:610 Y1:451 Y2:516
Alcohol is very, very bad. For children.
But once you turn 21...

42
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:15,970  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:456 Y2:516
...it becomes very, very good.
So scram.

43
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:17,931  X1:252 X2:464 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Oh, man.
- I'm sick of this.

44
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:23,042  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:451 Y2:516
Hey, Dad. What useless contraption
are you half-baking today?

45
00:03:23,213 --> 00:03:26,762  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:451 Y2:516
You what?
Oh, this is my latest invention.

46
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:30,846  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:451 Y2:516
A device that lets anyone
sound exactly like me.

47
00:03:31,053 --> 00:03:33,965  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:456 Y2:516
Good news, everyone.
I'm a horse's butt.

48
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,846  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:516
I am? That's not good news at all,
you little...

49
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:41,045  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:516
What's this device's marketability?
Who's the target consumer?

50
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:44,245  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:451 Y2:516
There is no target consumer.
Only targets.

51
00:03:44,413 --> 00:03:48,645  X1:106 X2:608 Y1:456 Y2:516
Targets that will tremble in fear as
their new masters hand down edicts...

52
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:51,281  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:490 Y2:516
...in my glorious, booming voice!

53
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:55,288  X1:174 X2:540 Y1:451 Y2:516
Now quit pestering me,
you confounded scoundrels!

54
00:04:00,213 --> 00:04:01,646  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Can I collate that?
- No.

55
00:04:01,813 --> 00:04:05,169  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Can I shred these contracts?
- No!

56
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:07,762  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:490 Y2:516
Wow! A power stamper.

57
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,125  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:061 Y2:087
Now look at all the work I gotta do!

58
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:26,087  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:490 Y2:516
The ingredients are cooked.

59
00:04:26,293 --> 00:04:28,682  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:451 Y2:516
They picked up some of your
natural robot flavorings.

60
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:30,332  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:061 Y2:087
Time to add the yeast.

61
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:35,450  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:516
Yeast? You mean I'll have a life form
growing inside me?

62
00:04:35,613 --> 00:04:38,685  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:494 Y2:516
It's so beautiful.

63
00:04:41,653 --> 00:04:44,247  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Talk to me.
<i>- This is Professor Farnsworth.</i>

64
00:04:44,413 --> 00:04:47,564  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>I have an important delivery</i>
<i>for you and your dumb crew.</i>

65
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:50,452  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>You must deliver a pizza</i>
<i>to Dog Doo 8...</i>

66
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:53,286  X1:105 X2:609 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>... a planet at the edge of the universe.</i>

67
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:57,930  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:450 Y2:516
Sorry I can't come to say goodbye,
but I'm busy inventing useless junk.

68
00:04:58,093 --> 00:05:01,244  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:495 Y2:516
And I smell bad.

69
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:23,851  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:516
If you were my kids, you'd get
quite a talking to. From your father.

70
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:25,844  X1:120 X2:594 Y1:490 Y2:516
When he got home from the Senate.

71
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:27,771  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:451 Y2:516
Oh, bother.
What have they done now?

72
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:30,766  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:451 Y2:516
Those pork dumplings
sent us on a fake pizza delivery.

73
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:32,446  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:490 Y2:516
The address was on Dog Doo 8.

74
00:05:32,613 --> 00:05:35,286  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:451 Y2:516
But the universe ends right after
Dog Doo 7.

75
00:05:35,493 --> 00:05:38,849  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Child-man, is this true?
- Yeah. But why are you mad at us?

76
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:42,483  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
Your dummy brigade wasted a week
on an obviously fake mission.

77
00:05:42,693 --> 00:05:45,844  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:516
Plus, they're making bootleg beer
inside company property.

78
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:49,045  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:495 Y2:516
Lies! Lies and slander!

79
00:05:49,213 --> 00:05:53,525  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:456 Y2:516
Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed?
That's the last straw!

80
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,644  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:451 Y2:516
You boys have been underfoot
long enough.

81
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:57,969  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:451 Y2:516
You jerked the words
right out of my mouth.

82
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:01,170  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:516
We're their fathers,
and it's high times we acted like it.

83
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,846  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:495 Y2:516
Here comes violence.

84
00:06:04,493 --> 00:06:06,290  X1:199 X2:515 Y1:490 Y2:516
Get a job, you lazy kids.

85
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:12,447  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:451 Y2:516
I guess if you want children beaten,
you have to do it yourself.

86
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:16,891  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:493 Y2:516
Come on, Dad. Shuffle faster!

87
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:19,408  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:450 Y2:516
You don't wanna miss
the unveiling of our company.

88
00:06:19,573 --> 00:06:21,723  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:490 Y2:516
Company?

89
00:06:21,893 --> 00:06:27,684  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:455 Y2:516
Cute. What'll you peddle? Lemonade?
Shoeshines? Cootie insurance?

90
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:32,290  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:450 Y2:516
Perhaps they've constructed
a teddy bear hospital.

91
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:35,930  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:450 Y2:516
Actually, we're starting
a competing delivery company.

92
00:06:40,773 --> 00:06:44,209  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:495 Y2:516
Welcome to the world of business.

93
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:55,009  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:450 Y2:516
Who's going to use a delivery service
with a kicked sign?

94
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:58,205  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Nobody, that's who.
- We already have a client signed up.

95
00:06:58,373 --> 00:07:01,092  X1:112 X2:601 Y1:061 Y2:088
We're delivering the <i>Daily Supernova.</i>

96
00:07:01,573 --> 00:07:06,488  X1:122 X2:592 Y1:451 Y2:516
So your delivery company
is just a cute, harmless paper route.

97
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,684  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:494 Y2:516
No. It's a serious business.

98
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:13,284  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:516
Yes. It's a tremendous responsibility,
all right.

99
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:16,053  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:451 Y2:516
What if a paper
were to land in a puddle?

100
00:07:16,213 --> 00:07:19,091  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:451 Y2:516
Civilization as we know it
might get splashed.

101
00:07:30,573 --> 00:07:32,609  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:061 Y2:121
Why do they always
treat us like dumb kids?

102
00:07:32,773 --> 00:07:35,970  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:061 Y2:122
We're practically old enough
to find the Fox Network infantile.

103
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:38,522  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:061 Y2:127
We'll show them.
All Awesome Express needs...

104
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:41,207  X1:195 X2:519 Y1:451 Y2:516
...is a sturdy
interstellar delivery craft.

105
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:43,212  X1:321 X2:393 Y1:495 Y2:516
Voilà!

106
00:07:43,373 --> 00:07:45,933  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:490 Y2:516
You got a quarter?

107
00:07:51,613 --> 00:07:55,128  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:451 Y2:516
Man! The ad said to allow
four to six seconds for delivery.

108
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:57,523  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:495 Y2:516
More like seven.

109
00:07:58,893 --> 00:08:03,489  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:455 Y2:516
I'm really starting to swell up
with beer. I must look ridiculous.

110
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:05,524  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:490 Y2:516
No. You have a healthy glow.

111
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:10,245  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Oh, my God! I just felt it ferment.
- Let me feel.

112
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:12,330  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:490 Y2:516
Have you thought about a name?

113
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,763  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:456 Y2:516
I was thinking Benderbrau
if it's an ale...

114
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:16,764  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:489 Y2:516
...Botwiser if it's a lager.

115
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:19,163  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:450 Y2:516
I hope it's a lager.
I can take it to a ball game.

116
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:22,732  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:495 Y2:516
I felt that one!

117
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,609  X1:149 X2:565 Y1:494 Y2:516
There's a crack in the hull here.

118
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:32,048  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:451 Y2:516
That could cause
explosive decompression.

119
00:08:32,213 --> 00:08:34,408  X1:238 X2:477 Y1:495 Y2:516
Put a sticker on it.

120
00:08:36,773 --> 00:08:40,652  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:451 Y2:516
Off on your first delivery?
You be careful, my little tinkler.

121
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:44,203  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:451 Y2:516
Remember we used to
call you that, huh? Tinkler.

122
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:49,847  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:456 Y2:516
Gets moving. Those newspapers
won't deliver themselves.

123
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:52,203  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:489 Y2:516
Only the Sunday edition can do's that.

124
00:08:53,373 --> 00:08:56,888  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:456 Y2:516
Goodness, there must be 50 papers
in that bundle.

125
00:08:57,093 --> 00:09:00,290  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:516
- That's a big number, 50.
- Yeah. If you're an idiot.

126
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:07,048  X1:245 X2:471 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Three, two, one.
- All systems go.

127
00:09:07,253 --> 00:09:09,562  X1:305 X2:411 Y1:495 Y2:516
Blastoff!

128
00:09:13,973 --> 00:09:18,603  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:451 Y2:516
- See you at din-din.
- I'm blowing you a kiss.

129
00:09:19,773 --> 00:09:21,491  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:495 Y2:516
Take evasive action!

130
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:26,892  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:455 Y2:516
It's closing in. You can't avoid it.
It's a cheek-seeker.

131
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:29,283  X1:302 X2:413 Y1:451 Y2:516
And...
Got you!

132
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:31,250  X1:337 X2:379 Y1:495 Y2:516
No!

133
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:33,331  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
Business is down, so I filed papers
to have you all reclassified as slaves.

134
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:39,924  X1:181 X2:533 Y1:450 Y2:516
Well, well, if it isn't
our little munchkin moguls.

135
00:10:41,693 --> 00:10:44,730  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:516
What's the trouble, men? Need
some penny rolls for your profits?

136
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:47,493  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:450 Y2:516
Actually, thanks to Dwight's
brilliant accounting...

137
00:10:47,653 --> 00:10:50,213  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:490 Y2:516
...and my unaccountable brilliance...

138
00:10:50,373 --> 00:10:53,331  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:456 Y2:516
...our paper route now has
over a million customers!

139
00:10:54,373 --> 00:10:56,523  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:516
We're finally making more money
than you guys.

140
00:10:56,693 --> 00:10:59,969  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:516
Aren't you impressed now, Pops?
Aren't you? Aren't you?

141
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:02,089  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:490 Y2:516
In a small way, yes.

142
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:05,330  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:455 Y2:516
You still don't have your own building
or conference table...

143
00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:07,051  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:490 Y2:516
...or one of those things.

144
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:08,612  X1:322 X2:393 Y1:495 Y2:516
Hello.

145
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:13,010  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:456 Y2:516
Our dads are never impressed,
no matter what we do.

146
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,970  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:490 Y2:516
Maybe we should start a fire.

147
00:11:15,173 --> 00:11:18,927  X1:101 X2:614 Y1:451 Y2:516
If we really want to impress them,
we'll have to crush them with strategy.

148
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:20,572  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:061 Y2:087
Dwight Lightning.

149
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:25,528  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:451 Y2:516
Very well.
But I get to name the next strategy.

150
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:29,001  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:456 Y2:516
<i>This week on</i>
The Real World - The Sun:

151
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:32,648  X1:219 X2:498 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>I'm burning to death!</i>

152
00:11:32,813 --> 00:11:36,647  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:451 Y2:516
You know how much an apartment
that big would cost on the sun?

153
00:11:36,813 --> 00:11:40,283  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:451 Y2:516
People! As you know, our young sons
have become great successes...

154
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:42,205  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:490 Y2:516
...in the very same field as us.

155
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:43,886  X1:246 X2:470 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Oh, that's great!
- That's good.

156
00:11:44,093 --> 00:11:45,492  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:489 Y2:516
Naturally, we're humiliated.

157
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:47,883  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's why we need you,
our loyal crew...

158
00:11:48,053 --> 00:11:51,648  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:451 Y2:516
...to make Planet Express
800% more profitable.

159
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:55,442  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:516
We'll start by slashing salaries.
And this time, I mean really slashing.

160
00:11:55,653 --> 00:11:57,883  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:450 Y2:516
Guys? I don't know how
to tell you this...

161
00:11:58,053 --> 00:12:00,442  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:450 Y2:516
...so I'll just let Fry
blurt it out thoughtlessly.

162
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,086  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:489 Y2:516
We don't work for you anymore!

163
00:12:02,293 --> 00:12:04,249  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:451 Y2:516
- What?
- Dwight and Cubert made us an offer.

164
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:06,369  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:450 Y2:516
- We're paperboys now.
- Incoming!

165
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:09,172  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:455 Y2:516
We've got papers to stuff, team.
Hut-two. Hut-two.

166
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:11,841  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:454 Y2:516
- Yes, sir.
- We're on it, Mr. Farnsworth.

167
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,528  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:490 Y2:516
Folks? The situation is grim.

168
00:12:19,693 --> 00:12:25,325  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:451 Y2:516
But we shall prevail, thanks to you,
our crack team of loyal dregs.

169
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:31,603  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I don't even know who this guy is.
- I'm Scruffy, the janitor.

170
00:12:31,813 --> 00:12:34,850  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:451 Y2:516
Of course you are.
Now, we've got to buckle down...

171
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:36,810  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:490 Y2:516
...and save Planet Express.

172
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:38,810  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:494 Y2:516
I'm on break.

173
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:50,683  X1:096 X2:619 Y1:451 Y2:516
Sorry to interrupt this whirlwind of
activity, but we have an announcement.

174
00:12:50,893 --> 00:12:54,727  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:451 Y2:516
I direct your attention to the forms which
I'm presently engaged in handing you.

175
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:58,204  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:451 Y2:516
Sweet guinea pig of Winnipeg!
They've taken over our company.

176
00:12:58,373 --> 00:13:01,012  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:490 Y2:516
Balderdash! I never agreed to that.

177
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:04,683  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:061 Y2:126
No. But you did declare yourself dead
three years ago as a tax dodge.

178
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:08,044  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:451 Y2:516
Tax dodge, nothing! You take one nap
in a ditch at the park...

179
00:13:08,213 --> 00:13:10,488  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:456 Y2:516
...and they start declaring you
this and that.

180
00:13:10,693 --> 00:13:13,890  X1:138 X2:576 Y1:061 Y2:126
Either way, I technically inherit
your building and your spaceship.

181
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:16,886  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:061 Y2:087
Which means Planet Express is now...

182
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:19,044  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:490 Y2:516
...Awesome Express.

183
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,449  X1:254 X2:461 Y1:495 Y2:516
You rotten kids!

184
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:24,171  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Will you be hiring?
- No.

185
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:26,284  X1:254 X2:461 Y1:495 Y2:516
You rotten kids!

186
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:39,724  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:456 Y2:516
There. One million papers,
folded and loaded.

187
00:13:42,013 --> 00:13:44,766  X1:113 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516
Leela, help me apply
these flame decals I got in my cereal.

188
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:46,651  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:489 Y2:516
They'll make the ship go faster.

189
00:13:46,853 --> 00:13:49,162  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:516
And what's your scientific basis
for thinking that?

190
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:50,362  X1:312 X2:404 Y1:494 Y2:516
I'm 1 2.

191
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:59,209  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:451 Y2:516
Did I ever tell you
how I used to own that ship?

192
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:06,446  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:490 Y2:516
There but for the grace of God.

193
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:18,123  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:489 Y2:516
Oh, my God! I think it's time!

194
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,563  X1:132 X2:582 Y1:451 Y2:516
Hurry, Leela!
Get some coasters and cold mugs.

195
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:24,525  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:493 Y2:516
Push, Bender! Push!

196
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,091  X1:232 X2:482 Y1:489 Y2:516
You're doing great.

197
00:14:28,253 --> 00:14:31,529  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:455 Y2:516
Oh, it feels like it's trying to push
a waterbed out of me.

198
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:34,167  X1:117 X2:597 Y1:495 Y2:516
Almost there. Just two more bottles.

199
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:38,446  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:489 Y2:516
Is it okay? I can't hear anything.

200
00:14:38,613 --> 00:14:41,969  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:489 Y2:516
It's an ale. Five gallons, six ounces.

201
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,127  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:489 Y2:516
Hey, what's going on?

202
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,608  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:451 Y2:516
This is a delivery company,
not a delivery room.

203
00:14:51,773 --> 00:14:54,412  X1:174 X2:540 Y1:451 Y2:516
We busted our buns
delivering a million papers...

204
00:14:54,573 --> 00:14:58,361  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:451 Y2:516
...and this is how you greet us?
With a bunch of frosty cold beers?

205
00:14:58,573 --> 00:15:02,407  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:451 Y2:516
Hey, wait a second. How did you
deliver a million papers in one hour?

206
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,642  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:456 Y2:516
We just did, okay?
'Cause we're awesome.

207
00:15:05,813 --> 00:15:09,249  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Yeah. Awesome.
- Yeah. Awesome.

208
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:12,292  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:451 Y2:516
Hello, Awesome Express, the rude,
crude delivery dudes.

209
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,206  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:456 Y2:516
How may I direct your call?
What's that?

210
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:20,527  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:516
You haven't gotten your paper?
In how long?

211
00:15:26,613 --> 00:15:31,562  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:451 Y2:516
Might a homeless old man
have a touch more beef bourguignon...

212
00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:33,849  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:490 Y2:516
...and another tequila slammer?

213
00:15:35,013 --> 00:15:37,129  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Please?
- Don't you sweet-talk me...

214
00:15:37,293 --> 00:15:41,366  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:451 Y2:516
...you wrinkly old tube sock.
- May I have one too, wife?

215
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:44,451  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:516
You're both pathetic, being jealous
of your own offspring.

216
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:47,207  X1:159 X2:555 Y1:451 Y2:516
Now, you should be happy
that they became successes...

217
00:15:47,373 --> 00:15:49,523  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:451 Y2:516
...instead of following
in your food stamps.

218
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:52,964  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:516
Oh, it's true.
But they grow up so fast.

219
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:55,601  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:451 Y2:516
We wanted a few more years
of being better than them.

220
00:15:55,773 --> 00:16:01,211  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:516
They're so stinking talented, they
don't even need their fathers anymore.

221
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:10,451  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Dad! We screwed up.
- You did? Tough luck, suckers.

222
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:14,965  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:451 Y2:516
Help us, Pops. We agreed to deliver
way more papers than we could handle.

223
00:16:15,173 --> 00:16:18,643  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:455 Y2:516
We couldn't handle them. We dumped
the extras in a crater on the moon.

224
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:21,373  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:516
Now everybody's yelling at us
about their missing papers.

225
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:24,445  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:494 Y2:516
And we don't know what to do!

226
00:16:30,453 --> 00:16:33,172  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:490 Y2:516
Why did you boys do all this?

227
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:37,242  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:451 Y2:516
- We wanted you to be proud of us.
- Proud of you?

228
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,052  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:451 Y2:516
You ruined us
with sleazy business practices...

229
00:16:40,213 --> 00:16:42,773  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:451 Y2:516
...and a complete disregard
for human decency.

230
00:16:42,973 --> 00:16:45,726  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Of course we're proud of you.
- Damn right, we are!

231
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:51,172  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:516
Now, come on, let's go do a little
father-son weaseling out of this.

232
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:59,008  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
Good thing I had this net installed
for catching giraffes.

233
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:20,241  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:451 Y2:516
Okay, boys. Let me show you
how a paper man does it.

234
00:17:27,573 --> 00:17:30,485  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:495 Y2:516
<i>Au revoir!</i>

235
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,891  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:490 Y2:516
Can I use the gun, Dad?

236
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,250  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:456 Y2:516
What kind of father would I be
if I said no?

237
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:44,283  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:456 Y2:516
Only one house to go.
We did it!

238
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:54,007  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:451 Y2:516
Run away!
That bully, Brett Blob, lives there.

239
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:56,204  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:489 Y2:516
He's ugly, mean, stupid, stink mucus!

240
00:17:56,373 --> 00:18:00,651  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:456 Y2:516
And last week,
we sort of broke his window.

241
00:18:00,853 --> 00:18:04,289  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:451 Y2:516
All right, all right. What do we do
when we break somebody's window?

242
00:18:04,493 --> 00:18:06,643  X1:242 X2:473 Y1:454 Y2:516
- Pay for it?
- Oh, heavens, no!

243
00:18:06,813 --> 00:18:10,089  X1:109 X2:605 Y1:490 Y2:516
We apologize with nice, cheap words.

244
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:17,771  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:456 Y2:516
I thought I heard the doorbell.
But I see it was the "dork bell."

245
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,005  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:490 Y2:516
You made a funny good one, Brett.

246
00:18:21,213 --> 00:18:23,727  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:456 Y2:516
Now, now, no need to give us
the business.

247
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:28,523  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:455 Y2:516
- We'd like a word with your daddy.
- Whatever. Dad!

248
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:32,965  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:450 Y2:516
Don't worry, boys. I'm sure his father
is a perfectly normal, reasonable man.

249
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:34,248  X1:231 X2:486 Y1:490 Y2:516
What do you want?

250
00:18:34,453 --> 00:18:38,731  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516
Mr. Blob, our sons have come to
apologize for damaging your window.

251
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:42,090  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:450 Y2:516
They've learned their lesson,
and they want to make amends.

252
00:18:42,253 --> 00:18:44,244  X1:275 X2:441 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Sorry, sir.
- Yeah, sorry.

253
00:18:44,453 --> 00:18:48,731  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:451 Y2:516
You shove your apology into the bottom
of your one-way digestive system.

254
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:52,528  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:451 Y2:516
Now, see here. We assured our sons
that you'd accept their apology.

255
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:58,288  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:516
Tell you what. I'll accept their apology
when they kiss my ass!

256
00:18:58,653 --> 00:19:00,564  X1:229 X2:485 Y1:494 Y2:516
Which I don't have.

257
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:06,567  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
- No one gives my boy that option.
- Bring it on, Jell-O pop.

258
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:09,008  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Yeah, get him, Dad.
- Show him who's boss.

259
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:16,005  X1:258 X2:458 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Get him, Pops.
- Right.

260
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:29,726  X1:226 X2:488 Y1:061 Y2:082
That was incredible!

261
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:32,965  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:456 Y2:516
You are the bravest dads
in the entire trauma center.

262
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,209  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:451 Y2:516
You guys almost had him,
until he digested you.

263
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:37,881  X1:217 X2:498 Y1:489 Y2:516
Oh, you're good kids.

264
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:41,602  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:451 Y2:516
If I could feel anything right now,
it would be pride.

265
00:19:43,253 --> 00:19:46,051  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:490 Y2:516
I was wrong! I can still feel pain!

266
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:52,287  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:455 Y2:516
He's come to finish the job.
Someone toss me out the window!

267
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:56,532  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:451 Y2:516
No, no wait. I feel terrible
about what happened.

268
00:19:56,693 --> 00:20:00,527  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:450 Y2:516
I've just been under a lot of stress
lately down at the plant, you know?

269
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:04,481  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:450 Y2:516
They're bringing in computers
to improve productivity...

270
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:08,202  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:455 Y2:516
...and, well, that's no excuse
for how I acted.

271
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:12,764  X1:100 X2:614 Y1:451 Y2:516
But the boy needs to see that real men
solve their disagreements with words...

272
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:16,045  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:451 Y2:516
...not violence.
So if you'll accept my apology...

273
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:20,172  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:451 Y2:516
...well, I hope we can put
this embarrassing incident behind us.

274
00:20:21,493 --> 00:20:23,051  X1:292 X2:424 Y1:490 Y2:516
I suppose.

275
00:20:23,413 --> 00:20:26,883  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:451 Y2:516
Hey, chumps. I heard you were
on the ass end of an ass-kicking.

276
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:29,368  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:490 Y2:516
I figured you could use a few of these.

277
00:20:29,573 --> 00:20:33,282  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:451 Y2:516
Why not? Might as well live it up
as long as I got this catheter in me.

278
00:20:33,493 --> 00:20:35,609  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:489 Y2:516
Won't you join us, Mr. Blob?

279
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:37,963  X1:234 X2:481 Y1:490 Y2:516
Sounds like a plan.

280
00:20:38,293 --> 00:20:40,284  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:451 Y2:516
This is what makes life
worth clinging to.

281
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:43,889  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:456 Y2:516
Three fathers enjoying a day out
with their sons.

282
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:47,765  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:455 Y2:516
It would seem we've taught our boys
a lesson about life.

283
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:52,529  X1:162 X2:552 Y1:456 Y2:516
Man or blob,
it's what's inside that counts.
