1
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:10,844
Ba-bum.

[croaks]

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,890
[panting]

00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:20,228
[Claudia] <i>Previously
on</i> The Dragon Prince...

5
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,397
Well, maybe it's just a mirror.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,606
[Viren sighs]

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,526
Of all the treasures, artifacts and relics

8
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,695
in the lair
of the Dragon King and Queen...

9
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,822
they kept this close to where they slept.

10
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,240
It must be important.

11
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,119
You're writing a letter... to the king?

12
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,014
[Callum] <i>He'll be worried about us.</i>

13
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,916
It'll mean a lot to him to know
why we left and that we're doing okay.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,419
Wait. They don't know, do they?

15
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,796
[Viren] You are to return
with the terrible news

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,923
that the princes have perished.

17
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,260
What am I supposed to do
if we find them alive?

18
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,343
Oh...

19
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,930
you'll know the right thing to do.

20
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,767
[Claudia]<i> We'll find Callum and Ezran</i>

21
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,687
<i>wherever we find that vile,
bloodthirsty elven assassin.</i>

[chanting indistinctly]

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,198
There!

24
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,866
That's where we'll find them.

25
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:19,079
[ocarina playing faintly]

26
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,541

[ocarina continues]

28
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:37,889
Do it.

29
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,730
[theme music playing]

30

[roaring]

31
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,446
Go on. Do it.

32
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,865
What are you waiting for?

33
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,577
She's a Moonshadow elf.
And she kidnapped the princes.

34
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,036
- You just have to...
- I know!

35
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,956
I've just never attacked
someone who's sleeping before.

36
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,792
It doesn't seem... sporting.

37
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,420
You want me to wake her?

38
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:55,174
And how long do you need her
to be awake for it to be sporting?

39
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,885
Ten seconds? Five?

40
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,096
- One second.
- Okay. On three.

41
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,057
One... two...

42
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,381
- [Rayla grunts]
- [Soren gasps]

43
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,063
But how did you resist the sleep spell?

44
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:13,526
Oh, I used this lovely rose
to help me stay awake. [sniffs]

45
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,321
Hard to sleep with a thorn poking at you.

46
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,241
[Soren grunting]

47
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,497
Are we gonna fight,
or is this a talent show?

48
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,749
Oh.

49
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,464
[grunts and scoffs]

50
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,550
[Rayla grunts]

51
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:44,849
[exclaims]

52
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,144
[both grunting]

53
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,037
[panting] I keep telling people,

54
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,165
"'Sweep the leg' is not a thing
in swordfighting!"

55
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,209
[yelps]

56
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:15,338
Oh, any more swordfighting lessons?
I'm eager to learn.

57
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,715
- [Claudia] Soren!
- [Rayla gasps]

58
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,764
[chanting indistinctly]

59
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,351
Ahhh!

60
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,354
Any last words, elf?

61
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,275
- Does "hot mud" count as a word?
- What do you mean?

62
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,359
[yelps]

63
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,945
- [grunts]
- [Callum] Stop!

64
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,156
- Callum?
- [Callum] Don't fight each other!

65
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,241
You're not enemies.

66
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,177
- Your friends tried to kill me!
- She kidnapped you!

67
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,495
Threw mud in my face,
and some got in my mouth!

68
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:51,791
Okay! Okay! Knock it off a second.
Just let me explain.

69
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,293
First of all, Claudia and Soren,

70
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,021
I don't know what you're doing here,
but I'm really glad to see you.

71
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,715
Are you kidding?
They attacked me. How can you be glad...

72
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,466
Buh-buh-buh-buhp-buhp-buhp.

73
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,053
Yeah, they're two of my oldest friends,
and I am glad to see them.

74
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,433
But not glad to see you trying
to murder my new friend, Rayla,

75
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,893
- who happens to be...
- She's an elf!

76
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,938
- But a good elf.
- What do you mean, "But a good elf"?

77
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:18,026
She kidnapped you and Prince Ezran.
How can she be good?

78
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,945
There was no kidnapping.
We went with her by choice.

79
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:25,199
Listen. It's late.
Let's all just get some rest and cool off.

80
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,363
If, in the morning, I can't convince you
that we're all on the same side here,

81
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,371
you can fight each other then. Agreed?

82
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,540
Fine.

83
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,083
- Fine.
- Whatever.

84
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,002
Guess we'll kill you in the morning.

85
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,088
That's more like it! Come on.
I'll show you where you can stay tonight.

86
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,173
[sighs]

87
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:46,387
- That was very confident, Callum.
- Oh, yeah? Uh... I guess.

88
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,931
[chuckles] Even though
your hair's a little messy.

89
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,641
[both] Ugh!

90
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,071
[Gren] Good morning. I... I assume.

91
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,365
Come to think of it,
I have no idea what time of day it is.

92
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,576
Good whatever-time-it-is.

93
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,883
Today is a special day, mystery mirror.

94
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:28,179
It is the day you reveal
your secrets to me.

95
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,559
Ah!

96
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,276
I can't believe they found us.
I hope Claudia's not mad.

97
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,363
Last time we saw her,
you chained her to a wall.

98
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:50,284
Plus, you stole her Primal Stone.
Then you broke her Primal Stone.

99
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:56,916
- Yeah, yeah. But how does my hair look?
- Hmm... Well, it could be more up.

100
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,877
Who are you trying to impress, anyway?
Claudia?

101
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:04,674
[laughs] Wha! What? Wha...
Trying to impress...

102
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,844
[stammering] Does this look more up?

103
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,473
[Soren] I figured out what's going on,

104
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,393
why the princes have gotten
so chummy with the elf.

105
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:19,647
[sighs] Don't talk to me until I've had
my hot brown morning potion.

106
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,109
[slurps and sighs]

107
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,111
Okay. Go on.

108
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:29,198
She must have bitten them,
and now they both have Moonshadow Madness!

109
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,325
- What?
- It's a thing.

110
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,035
Where did you hear about that?

111
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,579
Camp.

112
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,790
[laughs]

113
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,461
Well, we need to do something.
Dad gave us a mission.

114
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,255
- To bring the princes home.
- Right.

115
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,175
Unless a terrible accident occurs.
Accidentally.

116
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,219
- [Claudia] What?
- Nothing. My point is...

117
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,767
we should stuff them in sacks!

118
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:01,564
Soren! They're our friends.
We should try persuasion first.

119
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,649
Use our words, not our muscles.

120
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,487
So you're saying...
we need to butter them up?

121
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,075
[gasps and laughs]

122
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,956
Pancakes!

123
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,374
[all cheering] Yeah!

124
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,670
[all laughing]

125
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,131
[sniffs]

126
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:34,138
- Mmm. I have to admit, these are good.
- Impossibly fluffy, right?

127
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,767
Mmm. How do you get them so light?

128
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,852
[Claudia] The secret
is separating the eggs,

129
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,522
and beating the whites
into a stiff meringue.

130
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,358
And just a hint of Dark Magic.

131
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,319
So...

132
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,533
now that we know you're not kidnapped,
you guys should come back home.

133
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,034
With the egg, of course.

134
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,829
Egg? Eggs would go great
with these pancakes.

135
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,666
Actually, there is no egg.

136
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,294
What? What happened to the egg?

137
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,458
- You'll understand in a second...
- [Zym whimpering]

138
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,465
[Claudia gasps]

139
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,802
[Zym whimpers]

140
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:17,682
[gasps and exclaims] It's so cute!

141
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:24,438
Oh! It's a baby dwagon! Hey, you...

142
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:30,152
Whoa! What happened to,
"It's not an egg. It's a powerful weapon"?

143
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,736
Still true.

144
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:35,199
Someday, it could bring death
and destruction raining down on all of us.

145
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,411
But right now, he's so widdle!

146
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,912
Well, get a good look,

147
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,207
because we're headed back to Xadia
to return him to his mother.

148
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,586
Rayla's right. We can't go home yet.
The mission is too important.

149
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,466
[Soren]<i> We need to butter them up...</i>

150
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,051
<i>butter them up... butter them up...</i>

151
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,554
<i>butter them up... butter them up...
butter them up.</i>

152
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,682
You all do need to come home...

153
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:06,939
because the king, your dad,
really misses you.

154
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:21,162
[yawns] Whoa. Did you catch
that intense look I got from the elf?

155
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,330
I think she's into me.

156
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,750
Ugh! She's not into you. She's onto you!

157
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:30,338
Soren, their dad is dead,
and you lied about it.

158
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,590
And they're our friends. It's wrong.

159
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:36,969
[scoffs] You squash innocent creatures
to make magic pancakes.

160
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:42,391
Look, I tried it your way, "using words."

161
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,019
Maybe it's time for my way,
punching and stuff.

162
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,102
No!

163
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,398
Give me one more day
to convince Callum to leave with us.

164
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:53,319
I'm going to rely on something
that's even stronger than muscles.

165
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,031
Some kind of magic muscles?

166
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,991
Trust.

167
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,369
We can't trust them!

168
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,079
[sighs] Look, I get it.

169
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:07,124
You don't like Claudia.
She tried to kill you multiple times.

170
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,961
But remember, until today, she thought
you were trying to hurt me and Ezran.

171
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:15,132
Ugh! That's not it, Callum.
I know they're lying.

172
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,510
I know, because...

173
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,763
- Well, because...
- Knock-knock.

174
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:31,941
So are you two, like...
Did I interrupt something?

175
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,319
- Between you and...
- What? Me and Rayla? No!

176
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,279
I don't think of her that way.

177
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:41,992
I think of her more as... an assassin.
An, uh... An assassin friend.

178
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,037
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I have friends like that.

179
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,874
- So, uh, you wanted to talk?
- Yes.

180
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,545
I need to tell you about some things
that happened back at home.

181
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:56,382
- You know, good things, bad things...
- Mmm-hmm. I broke your Primal Stone.

182
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,051
- What?
- Sorry. I just had to get it off my chest.

183
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,012
- But how did you...
- I smashed it. Yup.

184
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:06,517
- Hmm. Well, accidents happen.
- On purpose.

185
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:11,564
- I'm sure you had a good reason.
- I did! I really did.

186
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,232
Oh! You're the best, Claudia.

187
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,694
I know this doesn't
exactly make up for it,

188
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,696
but I thought maybe you would let me

189
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,657
show you around
all the magic Moon places and stuff?

190
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,033
I would let you.

191
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:32,501
- [Zym whines]
- [Ellis and Ezran giggle]

192
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,504
[Ava barks]

193
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,592
Ah! You can't hurt a kid, Soren.
He's just a kid.

194
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,680
On the other hand,

195
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:48,934
if there's an accident because he's
doing something dangerous and stupid,

196
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,728
well... that's on him.

197
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,900
[Ellis and Ezran giggle]

198
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,193
[Soren] Hey, friends!

199
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:01,447
Ez. Dragon. Wolf-girl. Wolf.

200
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,366
- And my main glow guy right here, Bait!
- [panting]

201
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,410
What's happening, little toad man?

202
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:07,953
[Bait groans]

203
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,541
I have an idea for something super fun,

204
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,504
but also incredibly dangerous in which
some potential accidents may occur.

205
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,964
But so fun! Who's in?

206
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,382
- [Ezran] What is it?
- I'm in!

207
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,219
I mean... [clears throat] What is it?

208
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:33,729
Oh. Uh, Claudia, this is Lujanne.
She's a Moon mage, an illusionist.

209
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:37,900
- Wow! Are you an illusion yourself?
- Well, no, I'm...

210
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,818
But you feel so real!

211
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,238
I am real.

212
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,782
Huh, that's exactly what
an illusion would say.

213
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:52,581
And just like that, she disappears.

214
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,350
This place is amazing!

215
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,812
[Callum] Yeah.
I wonder what all these runes do.

216
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,939
[Claudia] They're probably
incredible spells.

217
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,317
It's just too bad humans can't do magic
without a Primal Stone.

218
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,402
What?

219
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,903
[scoffs] Yeah, we can.

220
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,782
No, I meant Primal Magic.
Not, you know, your kind of magic.

221
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,994
Oh? My kind of magic?

222
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,538
Dark Magic.

223
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,333
Do you always whisper
when you're being judgmental?

224
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,711
Sorry, I didn't mean it that way.
I just...

225
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:42,548
I loved learning magic,
and I feel sad now that I can't.

226
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,967
But you can. If you want to.

227
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,473
I want to learn Primal Magic.

228
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,851
But you have to be born
with that magic inside you.

229
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:57,396
[chuckles] That's the great thing
about Dark Magic.

230
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,524
You just take creatures
that are born with magic inside

231
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,360
and squeeze it out of them.

232
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,617
What... You're doing it again,
Prince Judgy-face!

233
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,620
Look. Here's how I think about it.

234
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:17,458
Humans weren't born with magic.
We were born with nothing.

235
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,294
But we still found a way
to do amazing things.

236
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,005
That's what Dark Magic
is really all about.

237
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,760
I'm sorry. It's just not for me.

238
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,344
[Claudia] Hmm.

239
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,860
So you just zip across this line?

240
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:49,740
Exactly.
I call it the Slidey-Sling Go-Fast Rope!

241
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,701
- That is a good name.
- [whimpers]

242
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,786
[peg creaking]

243
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,372
Are you sure it's going to hold?

244
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,375
- Zym is nervous.
- [Zym groans]

245
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,502
I'll show you. It's fine.

246
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,382
[laughs and exclaims]

247
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,053
[Bait exclaims]

248
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,057
That was the best! [echoes]

249
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,520
Okay, Zym, this is your chance
to see what flying feels like.

250
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,855
Yeah!

251
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,776
Whoo!

252
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,278
- Yeah!
- [Zym exclaims]

253
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,241
Whoa!

254
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:38,497
Zym, you didn't open your wings.
That was the whole point.

255
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,165
- [whimpers]
- You could go again.

256
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,252
But what if, this time, you go first?

257
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,109
There's not much to see here,
but I thought I'd show you...

258
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:53,846
- Ruins! I love ancient ruins.
- Really? Me, too.

259
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,520
If you close your eyes,
you can imagine what it was like.

260
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,814
Everything so magical back then.

261
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,067
- It's beautiful.
- [wind blowing]

262
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,738
Yeah, beautiful.

263
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,241
Hey. Your eyes aren't closed.

264
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,248
[exclaims and grunts]

265
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,167
[both laughing]

266
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,712
You think this is great?
Wait until you see the Moon Nexus.

267
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,174
Actually, hold on.

268
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,551
We should come back tonight,
after the moon rises.

269
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,929
Great. It's a date.

270
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,101
It's a date!

271
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,151
- Whenever you're ready.
- [Zym grunts]

272
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,528
[Ezran exclaims]

273
00:17:56,033 --> 00:18:00,204
- What you thinkin' about?
- Nothing! What you thinkin' about?

274
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,834
I'm thinkin'... you should go next.

275
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,628
Go ahead.

276
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,799
Unless you think it's not safe
for some reason?

277
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:18,472
[scoffs] No. It's perfectly safe.
Let me just double-check this peg.

278
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,358
Ah, yeah, it's safe. So safe.

279
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,997
- [Soren exclaims]
- [peg creaks]

280
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,010
- We can't trust Soren and Claudia.
- I thought we talked about this.

281
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,054
But I have proof now.

282
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,766
Soren built a zippy line thingy for Ezran,
but it was a trap.

283
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,560
He wanted there to be an accident.

284
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:08,313
- Wait. How do you know that?
- The peg was kind of loose.

285
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,899
- Kind of?
- It was definitely loose.

286
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,611
Which is why Soren tightened it
before he went down.

287
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,656
So, it was loose,
but then he tightened it?

288
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,741
Callum, I know I'm not explaining it well,

289
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,953
but you just have to look me
in the eyes and trust me.

290
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,832
I can see you believe it.

291
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,710
But I've known Soren
and Claudia for years.

292
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,171
You and I don't have that yet.

293
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,357
Hey, are you doing something
different with your hair?

294
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,694
Some kind of a... braid-bag flower-dealy?

295
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,237
Yeah, it's cute. So what?

296
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,282
We need to stay focused
on getting the princes to leave with us.

297
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:04,578
I just want to make sure you're still
on mission, not just... having fun.

298
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,622
Uh, you built a zip line today.

299
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,707
I took no joy in that.

300
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,636
Lujanne, I need your help.

301
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,891
If wisdom is what you seek,
I shall do my best to fake it. [laughs]

302
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,143
That's an old illusionist joke.

303
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,229
Right. Um...

304
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,315
I need my friend to trust me,
but he doesn't.

305
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,359
And I think it's my fault.

306
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,738
I've been keeping a secret from him,
hiding the truth.

307
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,991
Rayla, look at the moon.

308
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,203
Light only falls
on half its face right now,

309
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,705
but that doesn't mean
the other half isn't there.

310
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,751
And it is the same with you.
There are parts you keep hidden.

311
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:58,257
If I want him to trust me,
don't I have to stop hiding the truth?

312
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:03,887
Real trust is about accepting
even the dark parts we will never know.

313
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,267
No. No, I don't think that's right.

314
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,311
Lying and hiding the truth
aren't that different.

315
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:15,440
Strong relationships need honesty,
the full truth.

316
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:20,779
[laughs] Oh! Now you sound
like my first three husbands.

317
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,907
I'm afraid of hurting him,
but I owe him the truth.

318
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,119
I can't leave Callum
in the dark any longer.

319
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,288
I have to tell him
what happened to his dad.

320
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:34,751
- Hmm. I'm glad my wisdom helped.
- It didn't. It was wrong.

321
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,630
Was it? Or was it just differently true?

322
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:55,105
This true-sight serum
will strip away all illusions,

323
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:59,234
and allow me to see you
for what you really are.

324
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,779
[chanting indistinctly]

325
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,915
[screams]

326
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:30,849
Nothing? Nothing. Nothing!
Oh, you're powerless, useless.

327
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:36,229
I thought you were going to be
something special, something important!

328
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,112
[screams]

329
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,379
[gasps]

330
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,466
What is this place?

331
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,441
Hi.

332
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,407
The moon's so bright tonight.
You can see our shadows.

333
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:42,712
Hey. Did you just have your hand-shadow
hold my hand-shadow?

334
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,757
- Did I?
- [laughs] Come on!

335
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,759
Take me to see the Nexus.

336
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,641
Wow!

337
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,687
It's like the moon, but more... here.

338
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:04,609
- So, Claudia...
- Yeah?

339
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:09,322
- Uh. I've known you for so long.
- Yeah. Me, too.

340
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,366
Well, sure.
You've known yourself your whole life.

341
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,036
[Claudia chuckles]

342
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,082
- Callum, you always make me laugh.
- You make me laugh, too.

343
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:24,379
And you make me think. You make me...
see the world a whole different way.

344
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:33,889
Wow. I, uh...
I suddenly don't have any more words.

345
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:40,812
[chuckles] That's okay.
We can just be here... without words.

346
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:51,907
Wait.

347
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,202
Callum, I need to tell you something.

348
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,002
Callum?

349
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,881
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
We need to talk.

350
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,258
I know what happened.

351
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,219
He's gone.

352
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,473
Oh, no.
