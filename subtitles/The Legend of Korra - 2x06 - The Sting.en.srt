1
00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:02,876
Earth.

2
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:04,511
Fire.

3
00:00:04,513 --> 00:00:06,130
Air.

4
00:00:06,132 --> 00:00:07,831
Water.

5
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:12,519
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements

6
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:15,472
and bring balance to the world.

8
00:00:20,293 --> 00:00:21,343
Someone has attacked

9
00:00:21,345 --> 00:00:23,162
the Southern Water Tribe cultural center.

10
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:25,848
All the evidence points
to Northern sympathizers,

11
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,517
but Mako suspects
there's more to this case.

12
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,436
Meanwhile, Varrick has cast Bolin

13
00:00:30,438 --> 00:00:32,304
as the hero of his newest mover.

14
00:00:32,306 --> 00:00:35,024
Asami has also ventured
into business with Varrick,

15
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:37,526
and a shipment of her
mecha-tanks is on its way

16
00:00:37,528 --> 00:00:40,229
to help the South in
its war against Unalaq.

17
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:06,972
We're under attack!

18
00:01:16,716 --> 00:01:20,102
Varrick is not gonna be happy about this.

19
00:01:36,903 --> 00:01:38,954
Where is he?

20
00:01:38,956 --> 00:01:41,573
Father said he would
meet us at this location.

21
00:01:41,575 --> 00:01:43,261
He'll be here.

22
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,768
Were you just in the spirit world?

23
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,771
Never mind that. Where is the Avatar?

24
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:57,806
She was within our grasp

25
00:01:57,808 --> 00:02:00,309
until a dark spirit attacked her.

26
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:02,228
They're out of control.

27
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,363
You didn't get her?

28
00:02:04,365 --> 00:02:06,765
The Avatar is dead.

29
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,051
We finally made it.

30
00:02:26,053 --> 00:02:28,637
Now we must stop the Evil Unalaq!

31
00:02:33,126 --> 00:02:35,811
The Southern Water Tribe is mine.

32
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:38,314
Next, I will conquer the world

33
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:41,633
with my water-bending doomsday device!

34
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:49,608
Don't worry, Juji and Roh-Tan,

35
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,994
I will end the Evil
Unalaq's reign of terror.

36
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:54,813
For I am Nuktuk, hero of the South!

37
00:02:57,585 --> 00:03:01,337
Nuktuk, you're not just
the hero of the South,

38
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:03,622
you're our best friend.

39
00:03:03,624 --> 00:03:05,257
Nuktuk-ity!

40
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:07,927
You two are the best snow
raccoon and arctic panda

41
00:03:07,929 --> 00:03:09,929

Bolin, look up there. What do you see?

52
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:43,295
I... is this a trick question?

53
00:03:43,297 --> 00:03:45,965
I'll tell you what I
see... a star being born.

54
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:47,916
You're a star. People love stars.

55
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:50,886
Stars tell them what
to think and how to act.

56
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:52,537
Bolin, have you ever tried to force

57
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:54,206
a monkey-marmot to ride a bicycle?

58
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,176
Uh... not that I can recall.

59
00:03:57,178 --> 00:03:58,477
Of course you haven't.

60
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,896
You can't force
monkey-marmots to do anything.

61
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:04,316
They've got to want to do it themselves.

62
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:06,485
- Right.
- With these movers,

63
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:08,070
we'll have the support of the people,

64
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:10,155
and before long, they'll
persuade the president

65
00:04:10,157 --> 00:04:12,608
to lend his troops to the war effort.

66
00:04:18,532 --> 00:04:20,916
My evil plan is working.

67
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,903
I've captured Nuktuk's
beautiful girlfriend.

68
00:04:24,905 --> 00:04:27,572
Not so fast, Evil Unalaq!

69
00:04:27,574 --> 00:04:32,878
Oh, I will save my true love and the South!

70
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:37,883
Unh!

71
00:04:37,885 --> 00:04:39,968
And now, your time is up.

72
00:04:52,098 --> 00:04:54,283
It's no use fighting, Nuktuk.

73
00:04:54,285 --> 00:04:58,270
My anti-energy net
makes bending impossible.

74
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,041
No! Please.

75
00:05:02,043 --> 00:05:05,377
Power... weakening.

76
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:07,046
Nuk-terrible.

77
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:09,331
Will this be the end of Nuktuk?

78
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,450
Can he escape from Unalaq's trap

79
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:13,135
and save the beautiful Ginger?

80
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:16,472
Find out next week on
The Adventures of Nuktuk:

81
00:05:16,474 --> 00:05:18,257
Hero of the South.

82
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:24,146
Wow. We got some major
chemistry on-screen.

83
00:05:24,148 --> 00:05:27,649
- Am I right?
- Yeah. On-screen.

84
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:29,134
What's wrong?

85
00:05:29,136 --> 00:05:30,969
Are you mad because I
left you in the clutches

86
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:32,271
of the Evil Unalaq?

87
00:05:32,273 --> 00:05:33,822
I'm gonna save you in the next episode.

88
00:05:33,824 --> 00:05:36,241
Ginger, let's work through this.

89
00:05:36,243 --> 00:05:39,244
Varrick, another one of
your ships has been captured.

90
00:05:39,246 --> 00:05:41,313
Darn it, Zhu Li, haven't I told you

91
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:44,333
I hate getting bad news
without first getting good news?

92
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:46,418
Oh, well, the good news is

93
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,171
it looks like your first mover
has gotten a great reception.

94
00:05:49,173 --> 00:05:51,990
That's old news! Let's go.

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,601
Is it true?

96
00:06:02,603 --> 00:06:05,971
I'm so sorry. Your entire
shipment was stolen.

97
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:08,307
Without that sale, I
don't know how much longer

98
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:09,942
I can keep my company going.

99
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:11,176
What am I gonna do?

100
00:06:11,178 --> 00:06:12,677
Don't worry.

101
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:14,863
I'm gonna find whoever's responsible.

102
00:06:14,865 --> 00:06:16,515
Chief Beifong is about to question

103
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:17,900
the captain of the ship.

104
00:06:19,353 --> 00:06:20,819
I know it's been a long day,

105
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:22,454
but walk me through what happened.

106
00:06:22,456 --> 00:06:25,690
We were ambushed about 30
klicks outside the harbor.

107
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:27,025
We never heard them coming.

108
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:28,693
This is the third attack this week.

109
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:30,362
At about the same location.

110
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:34,366
Yep, and smack-dab in
Republic city's jurisdiction,

111
00:06:34,368 --> 00:06:36,552
which means another problem for us.

112
00:06:36,554 --> 00:06:40,422
All this stress is gonna
turn old black beauty gray.

113
00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:42,558
It's gotta be Northern Water Tribe.

114
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,977
They're trying to stop
supply lines to the South.

115
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:47,012
I agree. Is there anything else

116
00:06:47,014 --> 00:06:48,564
about the attack you remember?

117
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:50,349
Anything unusual?

118
00:06:50,351 --> 00:06:51,883
There is one thing.

119
00:06:51,885 --> 00:06:54,770
The bombs exploded in a
way I've never seen before.

120
00:06:54,772 --> 00:06:56,271
They didn't have fuses.

121
00:06:56,273 --> 00:06:58,890
It was like they were
being detonated remotely.

122
00:06:58,892 --> 00:07:01,443
Like the bombs at the cultural center.

123
00:07:01,445 --> 00:07:03,111
Wait, where are you going?

124
00:07:03,113 --> 00:07:06,748
I gotta grab some evidence.

125
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,083
Asami, I heard the news.

126
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:10,419
I can't believe they took
my fifth favorite ship

127
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:12,571
in the Varrick industries fleet!

128
00:07:12,573 --> 00:07:14,373
Named her after my mom.

129
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,241
Rest in peace, rocky bottom.

130
00:07:16,243 --> 00:07:18,377
Without the money from that shipment,

131
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:20,345
Future Industries is almost broke.

132
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:22,747
Chief, I think there's a
link between this attack

133
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:24,466
and the attack at the cultural center.

134
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:25,750
What do you think you're doing?

135
00:07:25,752 --> 00:07:28,270
Solving this case.

136
00:07:28,272 --> 00:07:29,605
Did any of the people who attacked you

137
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:31,089
have one of these in their hand?

138
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:34,359
I think it's a remote detonator.

139
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:36,979
It was too dark to see anything.

140
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:38,263
Mako!

141
00:07:38,265 --> 00:07:39,982
Chief, I don't think
the people who attacked

142
00:07:39,984 --> 00:07:41,366
were Northern Water ribe.

143
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:43,986
Of course they were Northern Water Tribe.

144
00:07:43,988 --> 00:07:45,954
They were water-bending.

145
00:07:45,956 --> 00:07:49,208
Was this one of the guys who attacked?

146
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,109
No, I don't recognize him.

147
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:53,245
Oh, that's embarrassing.

148
00:07:53,247 --> 00:07:55,614
Nice try, rookie.

149
00:07:55,616 --> 00:07:58,834
Mako, leave. Now.

150
00:07:58,836 --> 00:08:00,469
Great work, everybody.

151
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:04,139
Another open and shut case for
the dynamic mustachioed duo!

152
00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:06,758
Wait, I think Mako might be onto something.

153
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,844
Chief, I know it's a long shot,

154
00:08:08,846 --> 00:08:11,296
but I have an idea how
we can catch these guys.

155
00:08:11,298 --> 00:08:13,932
Yeah, let's all listen to the rookie.

156
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:15,467
He's doing a better job than you.

157
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:17,402
Who's hungry?

158
00:08:17,404 --> 00:08:19,104
Enough!

159
00:08:19,106 --> 00:08:21,490
I don't want to hear your
lame-brained rookie ideas.

160
00:08:21,492 --> 00:08:23,642
You're a beat cop, not a detective.

161
00:08:23,644 --> 00:08:25,360
Now hit the street and do your job!

162
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:29,915
Lu and Gang are idiots.

163
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:32,367
I hate them and their stupid mustaches.

164
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:35,037
Forget them. What's this idea of yours?

165
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,672
A sting operation.

166
00:08:36,674 --> 00:08:38,674
I was thinking we'd set up a bait ship,

167
00:08:38,676 --> 00:08:40,008
take it out into the open ocean,

168
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,426
and capture whoever attacks it.

169
00:08:41,428 --> 00:08:42,427
Let's do it.

170
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,595
It's not that easy.

171
00:08:43,597 --> 00:08:45,497
For the plan to work, we need the police,

172
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:46,882
and Beifong already said no.

173
00:08:46,884 --> 00:08:49,685
We can make it work, just the two of us.

174
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:51,002
I don't know.

175
00:08:51,004 --> 00:08:53,004
I don't want to go behind Beifong's back.

176
00:08:53,006 --> 00:08:55,941
If she finds out, I could
get kicked off the force.

177
00:08:55,943 --> 00:08:58,310
Mako, I need your help.

178
00:08:58,312 --> 00:09:01,146
My mom is gone. My dad is in jail.

179
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:04,149
Future industries is all
I have left of my family.

180
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:06,535
I want to help you,

181
00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:09,688
but this is more than a two-person job.

182
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,356
First of all, we'd need a ship.

183
00:09:11,358 --> 00:09:12,357
Aah!

184
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:13,959
You need a ship? I got a ship.

185
00:09:13,961 --> 00:09:16,078
I want in on whatever you're talking about.

186
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,696
I love being in on plans.

187
00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:19,197
The less you know, the better.

188
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:21,500
Perfect! I love not knowing things.

189
00:09:21,502 --> 00:09:24,536
All right, I'm in. Let's get these guys.

190
00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:39,574
The ship's all loaded
with the dummy crates.

191
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:41,609
Let's get this sting operation going.

192
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:44,445
Not yet. We need some extra manpower.

193
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,114
What about Korra?

194
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:47,732
No better muscle than the Avatar.

195
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:50,752
Right, uh... Korra.

196
00:09:50,754 --> 00:09:53,504
Yeah, actually, she's, um...
she's out of town right now.

197
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:55,373
Everything okay with you two?

198
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,258
Yeah, yeah. Forget about Korra.

199
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,294
I'll go talk to Bolin.

200
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:05,600
Hey, Mako, what do you think?

201
00:10:05,602 --> 00:10:07,101
I did a little redecorating.

202
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:09,086
It turns out that one of
the perks of being a star...

203
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:10,421
you get lots of cash.

204
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:13,274
Is this a marble statue of you?

205
00:10:13,276 --> 00:10:16,194
It's also a hat rack.

206
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:18,229
We don't even have hats.

207
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:21,566
That's because we've never had a hat rack.

208
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:24,819
And now we do. Mako, you seem stressed.

209
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:28,373
I think you need to
take a little dipity dip.

210
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,708
I don't have time to
take a dipity dip, okay?

211
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,627
I'm trying to catch whoever's
been attacking the shipments,

212
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:34,779
- and I need your help.
- You need my help?

213
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:38,499
I don't know. I'm kinda busy.

214
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:40,335
You're sitting in a hot tub.

215
00:10:40,337 --> 00:10:42,720
I'm maintaining my instrument.

216
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:46,758
As an actor, my body is my instrument.

217
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,892
Are you gonna help or not?

218
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:49,394
You know, I recall a time

219
00:10:49,396 --> 00:10:50,895
when I needed your help,

220
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:52,597
and you basically told me to get a life.

221
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:53,931
So that's a no.

222
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,433
What am I supposed to do now?

223
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:56,901
I don't know, Mako.

224
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:58,803
Figure it out. Remember?

225
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:02,273
That's what you said to
me. Hurts, doesn't it?

226
00:11:05,978 --> 00:11:09,146
Ow! My instrument!

227
00:11:11,368 --> 00:11:13,918
Are you sure this is a good idea?

228
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,537
No, but it's our last resort.

229
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:22,660
Hey, Mako.

230
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:25,496
Whatever you think we did, we didn't do it.

231
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:27,465
I'm not here on police business.

232
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:29,801
I'm running an
off-the-books operation,

233
00:11:29,803 --> 00:11:31,185
and I thought the triple threats

234
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:33,337
might want a piece of the action.

235
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:35,022
How big a piece?

236
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:43,398
So Mr. Law and Order needs our help, huh?

237
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,733
What's in it for the triple threats?

238
00:11:45,735 --> 00:11:48,286
I am personal friends with the Avatar.

239
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:49,954
I might be able to convince her

240
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:51,956
to give shady shin his bending back.

241
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,576
Sounds good to me, boss.

242
00:11:55,578 --> 00:11:57,578
What about the rest of us?

243
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,796
I've got vehicles,

244
00:11:58,798 --> 00:12:01,499
all brand-new and top of the line.

245
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:03,084
They can be yours if you help.

246
00:12:03,086 --> 00:12:08,723
I think we got ourselves a deal.

247
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:18,382
This is right around the area
where the attacks happened.

248
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:20,902
So keep your eyes peeled, and stay quiet.

249
00:12:20,904 --> 00:12:23,521
I agree. Keep quiet, mouth
zipped, don't say a word.

250
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:24,722
That's the best thing to do

251
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:25,857
when you're trying to ambush somebody,

252
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:27,325
which is what we're doing here,

253
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:28,910
and it's basically what I'm always doing.

254
00:12:28,912 --> 00:12:30,528
I mean, I am a gangster, after all, and...

255
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,947
Two toed ping, please.

256
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:34,665
Oh, right.

257
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:37,285
So what's it like dating the Avatar?

258
00:12:38,338 --> 00:12:40,905
Come on, Mako, I gotta know.

259
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:42,740
Ping, stay focused!

260
00:12:42,742 --> 00:12:45,376
What? Why are you so weird about it?

261
00:12:45,378 --> 00:12:47,795
If I was dating the Avatar,
I'd tell you all about it.

262
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:50,965
There's nothing to know.

263
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:52,467
I broke up with her.

264
00:12:52,469 --> 00:12:54,719
You broke up?

265
00:12:54,721 --> 00:12:57,087
When? Why didn't you tell me?

266
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:58,306
I don't know.

267
00:12:58,308 --> 00:13:01,258
Yeah, right.

268
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,444
You broke up with the Avatar.

269
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:04,929
Like that happened.

270
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:07,949
Hey, Shady Shin, Viper.

271
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:10,985
Mako says he broke up with the Avatar.

272
00:13:10,987 --> 00:13:13,938
- Sure he did.
- Yeah, I did too.

273
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:19,160
All right, would you guys
knock it off and do your job?

274
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,918
And action!

275
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,119
Forget about me.

276
00:13:29,121 --> 00:13:31,455
You must capture the Evil Unalaq

277
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:33,007
before he gets away.

278
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:36,460
No! I'll never leave you.

279
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:38,128
Mm!

280
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,230
Cut!

281
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:41,232
There's no kiss in the script.

282
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:43,968
Sorry, I just kinda lost
myself in the moment.

283
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,521
It just felt so right.

284
00:13:46,523 --> 00:13:49,023
It did, huh? Your
girlfriend's about to die,

285
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:52,276
and instead of untying her, you kiss her.

286
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:53,361
Wait a minute!

287
00:13:53,363 --> 00:13:54,946
Maybe that will work.

288
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:56,664
Yes! It's genius!

289
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,148
Everybody take five.

290
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,651
Except for you, Zhu Li. Grab the tweezers.

291
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:03,254
I've got some neck-hair issues to resolve.

292
00:14:04,874 --> 00:14:08,626
So... that kiss. I liked it.

293
00:14:08,628 --> 00:14:11,629
And it seemed like you liked it too.

294
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:15,216
You're confusing Ginger the actress

295
00:14:15,218 --> 00:14:16,884
with Ginger the character.

296
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:18,436
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

297
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:20,187
I'm totally getting, like, a
weird vibe from you right now.

298
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:21,722
It's like, a minute ago,
when we were shooting,

299
00:14:21,724 --> 00:14:24,141
you were into me, but now you're not.

300
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:26,510
That's because Ginger loves Nuktuk,

301
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:27,678
not Bolin.

302
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,847
But Nuktuk is Bolin.

303
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:32,733
I'm a hero.

304
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:37,238
And that's why they call me two toed ping.

305
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,791
Because you have two extra toes.

306
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:42,126
That's right.

307
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:43,544
And there was already a twelve toed ping

308
00:14:43,546 --> 00:14:45,329
on the South side.

309
00:14:45,331 --> 00:14:47,698
Wait, guys. Do you hear that?

310
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,033
I didn't hear anything.

311
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:51,586
- No.
- Ah! What's taking so long?

312
00:14:51,588 --> 00:14:53,971
You just gotta relax, like me.

313
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:55,673
Maybe try taking your shoes off.

314
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:57,374
I'm gonna check it out.

315
00:14:57,376 --> 00:15:01,145
So how long do we have to stay out here?

316
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:04,315
I told you, it's gonna be a few hours.

317
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:06,350
What, do you have a hot date?

318
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:08,769
Actually, I do. And I wanna look my best.

319
00:15:08,771 --> 00:15:12,323
I gotta shower and shave. I
have a whole routine, okay?

320
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:14,224
Well, your date's gonna have to wait.

321
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:16,226
She's not gonna be happy about that.

322
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:17,561
Too bad.

323
00:15:17,563 --> 00:15:20,414
We were paid to keep Mako
and that dame distracted

324
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:23,501
for a few hours, so
that's what we're gonna do.

325
00:15:23,503 --> 00:15:26,621
See, this is why I never get dates.

326
00:15:40,052 --> 00:15:42,053
I just overheard Shady Shin and Viper.

327
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:43,721
We've been double-crossed.

328
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:46,140
We have to get off this ship.

329
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:49,727
Where do you think you're going?

330
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:57,401
Get 'em!

331
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,709
They're getting closer.

332
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:55,993
Not for long.

333
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:57,712
Watch out!

334
00:16:57,714 --> 00:17:00,497
We're not gonna make it.

335
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:07,304
One down, one to go.

336
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:18,849
We're stalled.

337
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:42,206
Mako, hang onto something.

338
00:17:47,846 --> 00:17:49,230
What was that all about?

339
00:17:49,232 --> 00:17:51,849
Someone paid the triple
threats to keep us distracted.

340
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:53,818
Distracted? From what?

341
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,553
Oh, no.

342
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:11,252
Whoever paid the triple
threats stole everything.

343
00:18:11,254 --> 00:18:13,804
I'm ruined.

344
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,033
My company... it's over.

345
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:22,669
We should check out your other warehouses.

346
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:24,637
Maybe they didn't have
time to hit them all.

347
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,373
You don't understand.

348
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,575
Everything I had was in here.

349
00:18:28,577 --> 00:18:30,477
We have to search the place for evidence.

350
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:32,379
If we can find a lead...

351
00:18:32,381 --> 00:18:35,849
Mako... it doesn't matter anymore.

352
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:37,584
I can figure this out.

353
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:41,054
Just stop. It's over.

354
00:18:41,056 --> 00:18:42,789
I give up.

355
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:47,694
Well, I'm not giving up on you.

356
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,937
Sorry, I...

357
00:18:57,939 --> 00:19:01,274
Uh... it's... it's okay.

358
00:19:01,276 --> 00:19:04,611
Um... anyway...

359
00:19:04,613 --> 00:19:06,012
I gotta run.

360
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:08,031
I'm gonna find out who did this.

361
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:10,016
And I know just who to ask.

362
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:13,686
Hey, Mako.

363
00:19:13,688 --> 00:19:16,122
Uh, you're not mad about
last night, are you?

364
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:17,991
Who hired you to double-cross us?

365
00:19:17,993 --> 00:19:20,627
- I don't know.
- I think you do know.

366
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:21,861
And you're gonna tell me,

367
00:19:21,863 --> 00:19:23,163
or we're gonna have to change your name

368
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:24,697
to "No toed ping."

369
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:27,667
Really, I don't know.
You have to believe me.

370
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:29,252
We never met the guy who hired us.

371
00:19:29,254 --> 00:19:32,388
You expect me to believe that?

372
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,340
After you left the
hideout, some mook showed up

373
00:19:34,342 --> 00:19:36,709
and said his boss would pay
us to keep you distracted.

374
00:19:36,711 --> 00:19:38,761
We'd never seen him before,
and we ain't seen him since.

375
00:19:38,763 --> 00:19:40,730
Come on, Mako, you know
how these deals work.

376
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:42,015
Please. I would never lie to you

377
00:19:42,017 --> 00:19:44,901
with my lucky toes on the line.

378
00:19:44,903 --> 00:19:46,936
Get out of here.

379
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:57,030
Bolin, have you seen Varrick around?

380
00:19:57,032 --> 00:20:00,066
Bolin!

381
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,204
Nuktuk.

382
00:20:04,206 --> 00:20:07,123
Yes? Oh, hello, Mako.

383
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,908
Didn't notice you there.

384
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,677
Where's Varrick?

385
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,212
I need to ask him something.

386
00:20:12,214 --> 00:20:14,413
Hmm. Can't say that I've seen him.

387
00:20:14,415 --> 00:20:15,715
But I've been kinda busy, you know,

388
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:17,217
rehearsing for my big scene.

389
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:20,419
There's gonna be some crazy "pyrotechnics."

390
00:20:20,421 --> 00:20:22,355
That's mover speak for explosions.

391
00:20:22,357 --> 00:20:25,775
We need Nuktuk on set.
Running explosion scene.

392
00:20:25,777 --> 00:20:27,810
Or sometimes we just call them explosions.

393
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:29,779
Anyway, wish I could stand
around here and chitchat,

394
00:20:29,781 --> 00:20:32,232
but you know, I gotta
go shoot my big scene.

395
00:20:33,902 --> 00:20:36,319
Okay, the set is clear.

396
00:20:36,321 --> 00:20:37,370
Camera's rolling.

397
00:20:37,372 --> 00:20:39,405
And... action!

398
00:20:39,407 --> 00:20:41,908
Ginger, stay down! I'm coming for you.

399
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,590
How did you rig those explosions

400
00:20:57,592 --> 00:20:59,625
- to go off like that?
- Neat, huh?

401
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:01,460
It's a Varrick Industries exclusive.

402
00:21:01,462 --> 00:21:03,229
Here, check it out.

403
00:21:03,231 --> 00:21:06,065
The explosions use a remote detonator.

404
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:07,466
Varrick.

405
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:13,639
Asami, I think I know who set us up.

406
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,947
Hello, Mako.

407
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:22,415
What are you doing here?

408
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:24,317
He just saved my company.

409
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,420
Varrick bought a controlling
interest in Future Industries.

410
00:21:27,422 --> 00:21:29,622
Isn't that great?

411
00:21:29,624 --> 00:21:31,591
Yep, I like to think I'm always there

412
00:21:31,593 --> 00:21:33,092
to stand up for the little guy.

413
00:21:33,094 --> 00:21:36,045
Especially if that little
guy can help this guy

414
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:37,630
become a bigger guy.

415
00:21:37,632 --> 00:21:39,849
So what were you saying, Mako?

416
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:42,168
You think you know who
hired the triple threats?

417
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:46,606
Yeah, and I'm real close to proving it.

418
00:21:46,608 --> 00:21:50,643
I'll fill you in later.

419
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:18,204
Get away from me!

420
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:23,042
It's okay, we're here to
help you, Avatar Korra.

421
00:22:23,044 --> 00:22:25,511
Who's...

422
00:22:25,513 --> 00:22:27,430
who's Avatar Korra?

423
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:33,569
What happened to you?

424
00:22:33,571 --> 00:22:35,688
How did you end up on our island?

425
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,442
I... don't know.

426
00:22:39,444 --> 00:22:41,661
I can't remember anything.
