1
00:00:00,574 --> 00:00:02,521
Earth.

2
00:00:02,523 --> 00:00:04,460
Fire.

3
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:06,163
Air.

4
00:00:06,165 --> 00:00:08,135
Water.

5
00:00:08,137 --> 00:00:09,843
Only the Avatar

6
00:00:09,845 --> 00:00:12,454
can master all four elements

7
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:16,135
and bring balance to the world.

8

9
00:00:20,176 --> 00:00:22,584
The Avatar has gone missing.

10
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:24,527
After president Raiko
refused Korra's request

11
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:26,637
to aid the South
in the war of the water tribes,

12
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:28,209
she headed to the fire nation,

13
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:30,577
seeking a new ally
against Unalaq.

14
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:32,281
But unbeknownst to her friends,

15
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:33,618
a dark spirit attacked Korra

16
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,794
and dragged her into the ocean.

17
00:00:35,796 --> 00:00:37,065
She has washed up
on a desolate island

18
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:40,307
with no memory of who she is.

19
00:00:55,884 --> 00:00:58,254
We found the Avatar
washed up onshore,

20
00:00:58,256 --> 00:01:00,894
but she doesn't
remember anything.

21
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:03,201
Raava.

22
00:01:03,203 --> 00:01:04,639
Raava.

23
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:07,247
Raava.

24
00:01:09,318 --> 00:01:12,724
A dark energy has infected her.

25
00:01:12,726 --> 00:01:15,099
We must purge it
before it destroys

26
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:18,610
her Avatar spirit.

27
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:21,749
Let the waters
cleanse the darkness

28
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:24,419
that plagues your spirit.

29
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,535
- Who are you?
- I am you.

30
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:48,879
Who am I?

31
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:51,486
You are the Avatar.

32
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:54,425
I don't know what that is.

33
00:01:57,632 --> 00:01:59,735
In order to remember,

34
00:01:59,737 --> 00:02:02,510
you must regain your connection

35
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:06,586
with your Avatar spirit.

36
00:02:06,588 --> 00:02:10,592
If you don't,
darkness will engulf the world.

37
00:02:10,594 --> 00:02:14,635
You will die,
and our era will end.

38
00:02:14,637 --> 00:02:17,644
How do I regain my connection?

39
00:02:17,646 --> 00:02:21,582
Go back.
Return to the beginning.

40
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:24,823
Find Raava.

41
00:02:35,644 --> 00:02:36,745
Are you Raava?

42
00:02:36,747 --> 00:02:40,383
No, but I can help you
find her.

43
00:02:40,385 --> 00:02:42,252
My name is Wan,
and I will show you

44
00:02:42,254 --> 00:02:45,257
how I became the first Avatar.

45
00:02:51,073 --> 00:02:53,174
Nobody steals
from the chou brothers!

46
00:02:53,176 --> 00:02:56,044
Really?
Because I just did.

47
00:02:56,046 --> 00:02:58,479
You're dead, Wan.

48
00:02:58,481 --> 00:03:02,086
Actually, I feel quite alive.

49
00:03:14,105 --> 00:03:16,237
Hey, stop!

50
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,400
Hey, fellas.

51
00:03:37,402 --> 00:03:38,900
You're just in time for lunch!

52
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:40,434
Oh!

53
00:03:44,106 --> 00:03:47,640
I told you
no one steals from us.

54
00:04:14,911 --> 00:04:16,411
Did you steal
from the Chous again?

55
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:18,314
Yeah, and I got nothing
to show for it

56
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:22,753
except a few dirty rolls
and a whole lot of bruises.

57
00:04:22,755 --> 00:04:26,057
Hey, Yao,
I got some food for you.

58
00:04:28,128 --> 00:04:30,298
Mmm.
Delicious.

59
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,433
Thank you, Wan.

60
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:40,814
You guys are hungry too, huh?

61
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:42,617
Wan, you should eat.

62
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:45,055
They need it more than I do.

63
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:47,893
Besides, I'm tired
of eating scraps.

64
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:49,026
If only there was some way

65
00:04:49,028 --> 00:04:50,326
to get
into the Chous' food cellar.

66
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:53,395
We'd be eating like...
well, like Chous.

67
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:56,301
If chou the elder catches you
sneaking into his palace,

68
00:04:56,303 --> 00:04:57,803
you'll end up dead.

69
00:04:57,805 --> 00:05:00,907
Or worse, he'll banish you
to the spirit wilds.

70
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:02,307
No, don't get banished.

71
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:05,308
You don't want nothing to do
with those spirits.

72
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,514
They'll get inside ya,
scramble up your mind,

73
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:13,454
turn ya into this...
a monster!

74
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:15,220
Don't do anything crazy, Wan.

75
00:05:15,222 --> 00:05:18,056
You just gotta accept
the world is the way it is.

76
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:20,494
Some people have power.
Some people don't.

77
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:21,497
And you don't.

78
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:26,372
Not yet, anyway.

79
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:30,373
Are you strong?
Are you fearless?

80
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:33,246
Do you have what it takes
to battle the spirits?

81
00:05:33,248 --> 00:05:35,182
Then join the hunt.

82
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:37,117
Count me in.

83
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,559
We're going to be out
in the wilds for a week.

84
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:45,395
You wouldn't last two seconds.

85
00:05:45,397 --> 00:05:47,899
I can handle myself.

86
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:49,233
We all get fire, right?

87
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:52,136
Yeah, but do you know
how to use it?

88
00:05:52,138 --> 00:05:54,773
Well, not exactly, but I...

89
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:56,276
ah, let him come.

90
00:05:56,278 --> 00:05:58,345
Not like we got
any other volunteers lining up.

91
00:05:58,347 --> 00:06:01,482
All right.
Welcome to the hunt.

92
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:32,421
The lion turtle.

93
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:34,324
Great guardian of our city,

94
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:36,626
we are venturing
into the spirit wilds

95
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:38,928
to bring back food
for our people.

96
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,166
Please, grant us
the power of fire.

97
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,972
The power is yours to keep

98
00:06:45,974 --> 00:06:49,508
until your return.

99
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,443
You're first, kid.

100
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:57,689
May the element of fire

101
00:06:57,691 --> 00:07:01,524
protect you
against the spirits.

102
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:08,067
Whoa!

103
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:11,871
Just make sure you aim
at the spirits, not us, okay?

104
00:07:11,873 --> 00:07:13,907
Sure thing.

105
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,084
Everyone stay close.

106
00:07:22,086 --> 00:07:24,520
Spirits love
to pick off stragglers.

107
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:26,522
Uh, guys?

108
00:07:26,524 --> 00:07:28,424
I don't think I can do this.

109
00:07:28,426 --> 00:07:30,060
Now, quit your whining.

110
00:07:30,062 --> 00:07:31,694
We haven't even seen
a spirit yet.

111
00:07:31,696 --> 00:07:34,029
I think I wanna go home.

112
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:37,467
I knew you were nothing
but a sniveling coward.

113
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:40,006
Go give your fire back
to the lion turtle,

114
00:07:40,008 --> 00:07:43,345
and don't ever show
your face around me again.

115
00:07:50,788 --> 00:07:52,788
Wan, you're back.

116
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,821
What goodies did you snatch
for us this time?

117
00:07:58,926 --> 00:08:00,260
What did you do?

118
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:02,330
You can't steal
from the lion turtle.

119
00:08:02,332 --> 00:08:05,003
Really?
Because I just did.

120
00:08:12,997 --> 00:08:14,298
You know it's forbidden

121
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,801
to bring the power
of the element into the city.

122
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:18,837
Please, go back
to the lion turtle

123
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,573
and return the fire.

124
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:24,346
Jaya, it's time to stop
being so afraid of the Chous

125
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:27,517
and show them we have the power
to change things.

126
00:08:33,294 --> 00:08:36,898
Hey, Chous!
Open the gate, and let us in.

127
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,269
What are those filthy peasants
doing here?

128
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:44,072
Don't worry, father.
We'll take care of them.

129
00:08:46,244 --> 00:08:48,544
Hand over all the food
you're hoarding,

130
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:50,312
and we won't give you
any trouble.

131
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:54,784
You're not getting past us.

132
00:08:54,786 --> 00:08:57,488
We have the weapons.
You're powerless.

133
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,992
Powerless, huh?

134
00:09:04,602 --> 00:09:07,168
Follow me!

135
00:09:12,877 --> 00:09:16,784
Grab as much food as you can.

136
00:09:16,786 --> 00:09:18,318
Maybe you're right.

137
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,687
Maybe we do have the power
to change things.

138
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:22,056
Stop right there!

139
00:09:22,058 --> 00:09:24,026
Looks like the Chous
found backup.

140
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:26,130
Get everyone out of here.

141
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,868
I'll hold them off.

142
00:09:43,186 --> 00:09:47,157
No, please.
Have mercy.

143
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,125
Wan?

144
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:57,763
Even when you have the power,
you're afraid to use it.

145
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:06,237
Tell me who else
was involved in the rebellion,

146
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,840
and I might take mercy on you.

147
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,675
I'm not telling you anything.

148
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:13,976
Then, you've left me no choice.

149
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:17,841
Wan, you are hereby banished.

150
00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:21,346
Yeah! And give back
the fire you stole.

151
00:10:21,348 --> 00:10:24,118
No!
Wait.

152
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,154
Great lion turtle, I am sorry

153
00:10:26,156 --> 00:10:29,161
for stealing the fire from you,
and I accept my punishment.

154
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:30,696
But please, I need to be able

155
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:32,598
to protect myself in the wilds.

156
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,603
Never again may you return

157
00:10:36,605 --> 00:10:38,875
to this city.

158
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:42,347
But I will allow you

159
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:47,219
to keep
the power of the element.

160
00:10:57,702 --> 00:11:01,538
Bet he doesn't last
till morning.

161
00:11:19,494 --> 00:11:22,396
Hey, watch where
you're stepping, human!

162
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:25,703
- Who said that?
- Down here!

163
00:11:25,705 --> 00:11:28,804
How'd you like it if I started
walking all over you?

164
00:11:28,806 --> 00:11:32,310
You're just a little frog.

165
00:11:32,312 --> 00:11:36,017
Who's little now?

166
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:30,504
Get off me!
Get off me!

167
00:12:52,395 --> 00:12:55,964
You are not welcome
in my oasis, human.

168
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:58,465
Please, help me.

169
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:00,732
I'm starving,
and I haven't slept all night.

170
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:03,503
Not my problem.

171
00:13:03,505 --> 00:13:06,339
Let me pass.

172
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:11,479
You dare use fire against me?

173
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:13,448
Now, be gone with you!

174
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,139
And who might you be?

175
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:47,440
I am bushy, the bush spirit.

176
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:51,179
And I would like to enter
your oasis.

177
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:54,118
Very well.
You may pass.

178
00:13:57,725 --> 00:13:59,489
Wait a second!

179
00:13:59,491 --> 00:14:01,289
Something stinks.

180
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,857
I knew I smelled a human!

181
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,371
Come on, let me in,
just for a little while.

182
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:16,108
No!
Go back to your lion turtle.

183
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,412
Believe me,
I'd love to go back home.

184
00:14:18,414 --> 00:14:20,716
But I can't.
I was kicked out.

185
00:14:20,718 --> 00:14:24,085
- That's too bad.
- Poor human.

186
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:25,952
Don't pity him.

187
00:14:25,954 --> 00:14:27,819
He's just like
every other human:

188
00:14:27,821 --> 00:14:29,556
Ugly, destructive,

189
00:14:29,558 --> 00:14:32,395
and lacking any respect
for nature.

190
00:14:32,397 --> 00:14:36,100
Who are you calling ugly, ugly?

191
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:37,267
Hmm.

192
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:39,467
If you can't go back
to your city,

193
00:14:39,469 --> 00:14:41,068
then you should go live
in another one.

194
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,407
What?
There are other lion turtles?

195
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:44,777
"There are
other lion turtles?"

196
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:47,245
Of course there are,
dozens of them!

197
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:50,013
Boy, you humans are stupid too.

198
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,981
So which way
to the nearest lion turtle city?

199
00:14:51,983 --> 00:14:53,981
Hmm.

200
00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:55,683
I think it's on the other side

201
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:58,018
of none-of-your-business valley.

202
00:15:04,157 --> 00:15:05,523
Real funny.

203
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:06,790
You know what?
I don't need your help.

204
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:09,492
I'll find it myself.

205
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:12,362
Good luck!

206
00:15:35,785 --> 00:15:38,186
It's okay.
I'm gonna get you out of there.

207
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,762
Finally, we caught something.

208
00:15:43,764 --> 00:15:46,365
Get it down.

209
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:47,365
Back off.

210
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:49,865
Wan?
What are you doing here?

211
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,167
I'm saving this animal.

212
00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:53,538
That animal's our dinner.

213
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,641
Now, get out of the way.

214
00:15:55,643 --> 00:15:58,346
No.

215
00:16:15,448 --> 00:16:16,950
Ahh!

216
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:21,185
He... help!
Help!

217
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:31,532
Get 'em off!
Get 'em off!

218
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:34,400
Ahh!

219
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:42,108
Well, looks like
you're all out of tricks, Wan.

220
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:50,519
I really hate humans!

221
00:16:50,521 --> 00:16:54,658
No, no.

222
00:17:01,944 --> 00:17:04,044
I don't know
what he's screaming about.

223
00:17:04,046 --> 00:17:06,614
He's better-looking now.

224
00:17:11,287 --> 00:17:13,890
I feel great.
What's in this water?

225
00:17:13,892 --> 00:17:17,128
It has
special healing properties.

226
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,931
Thanks.

227
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:21,901
So what did you do
to that hunter?

228
00:17:21,903 --> 00:17:23,604
Spirits are able to take over

229
00:17:23,606 --> 00:17:25,877
a human body for a short time.

230
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,446
If I stayed in there
any longer,

231
00:17:27,448 --> 00:17:30,682
I would've killed him,
which I did consider.

232
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:32,151
Thanks for saving my neck.

233
00:17:32,153 --> 00:17:34,354
But why'd you do it?

234
00:17:34,356 --> 00:17:37,492
I saw you save the cat-deer
from those hunters.

235
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:39,630
I've never seen such an act

236
00:17:39,632 --> 00:17:41,766
of selflessness
from a human before.

237
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:43,434
Told you
I wasn't like the others.

238
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:46,671
Guess I underestimated you,
human.

239
00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:49,543
Are you off to find
another lion turtle city?

240
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:50,947
I was.

241
00:17:50,949 --> 00:17:53,685
But I think I've had enough
of humans for a while.

242
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:54,687
I've decided to stay here

243
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:56,720
and learn the ways
of the spirits.

244
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:58,919
- What a great idea.
- That'll be fun.

245
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:00,287
Oh, now, now, hold on.

246
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:02,827
A human living with spirits?

247
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:04,196
It's never been done.

248
00:18:04,198 --> 00:18:05,366
First time
for everything, right?

249
00:18:05,368 --> 00:18:07,136
Hmm.

250
00:18:07,138 --> 00:18:09,171
I guess we can try it.

251
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,773
I've never had a human
as a pet before.

252
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:14,406
I think
I'll call you "stinky."

253
00:18:14,408 --> 00:18:16,176
The name is Wan.

254
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,646
Stinky is more accurate.

255
00:18:22,219 --> 00:18:23,752
What happened in the wilds?

256
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:24,919
Where are the others?

257
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:27,420
Gone.
Spirits took them.

258
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:29,354
They were protecting
that kid Wan

259
00:18:29,356 --> 00:18:31,555
like he was one of their own.

260
00:18:31,557 --> 00:18:34,429
Did you hear that?
Wan's still alive.

261
00:18:49,949 --> 00:18:52,082
And the way Wan moves fire,

262
00:18:52,084 --> 00:18:54,350
it's like nothing
I've ever seen.

263
00:18:54,352 --> 00:18:58,924
He uses it like
it's an extension of his body.

264
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:18,774
Wan has proven
that with the power of fire,

265
00:19:18,776 --> 00:19:21,112
anyone can survive
in the wilds.

266
00:19:21,114 --> 00:19:22,547
We don't have to live

267
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:25,216
under chou the elder's rules
anymore,

268
00:19:25,218 --> 00:19:27,982
so I say we leave this city
and start over.

269
00:19:27,984 --> 00:19:29,217
Who's with me?

270
00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:51,738
You ready to go, Mula?

271
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,907
You sure you want to leave?

272
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:56,544
Yes, it's time I see
the rest of the world

273
00:19:56,546 --> 00:19:58,481
and find
the other lion turtle cities.

274
00:19:58,483 --> 00:20:02,088
I'm proud to call you
my friend, stinky.

275
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,989
Thank you for everything.

276
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:05,657
Good-bye, everyone.

277
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:08,625
We'll miss you.

278
00:20:31,783 --> 00:20:34,720
The all-powerful spirits
are battling.

279
00:20:34,722 --> 00:20:37,522
They're gonna wipe out
the entire valley!

280
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,816
Stop,
or you'll destroy everything!

281
00:21:05,818 --> 00:21:08,818
This doesn't
concern you, human!

282
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,886
It does when the lives

283
00:21:09,888 --> 00:21:13,294
of spirits and animals
are in danger.

284
00:21:13,296 --> 00:21:15,831
If you're a friend to spirits,

285
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:19,400
then use your fire to help me
break free.

286
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:22,503
Don't involve the human.
This is between us.

287
00:21:22,505 --> 00:21:25,573
Please, save me.

288
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:29,580
She has tormented me
for 10,000 years.

289
00:21:29,582 --> 00:21:33,015
10,000 years?

290
00:21:33,017 --> 00:21:35,583
Let him go!

291
00:21:52,363 --> 00:21:54,599
Thank you, human.

292
00:21:54,601 --> 00:21:59,474
You have performed
a great service for the spirits.

293
00:22:03,307 --> 00:22:06,276
Do you realize
what you've done?

294
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:09,647
Yeah, I helped a spirit
who was being bullied by you.

295
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:11,915
You are gravely mistaken.

296
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:14,483
I was keeping him
under control.

297
00:22:14,485 --> 00:22:15,984
And what gives you the right?

298
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:19,289
You don't even know who I am,
do you?

299
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,428
- Should I?
- Yes.

300
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,432
My name is Raava.

301
00:22:24,434 --> 00:22:27,000
That spirit you freed is Vaatu.

302
00:22:27,002 --> 00:22:30,802
He is the force
of darkness and chaos.

303
00:22:30,804 --> 00:22:33,935
I am the force
of light and peace.

304
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,737
Since the beginning of time,

305
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:38,344
we have battled
over the fate of this world.

306
00:22:38,346 --> 00:22:41,516
And for the past 10,000 years,

307
00:22:41,518 --> 00:22:43,849
I have kept darkness
under control

308
00:22:43,851 --> 00:22:45,949
and the world in balance,

309
00:22:45,951 --> 00:22:47,651
until you came along.

310
00:22:47,653 --> 00:22:50,892
So by freeing Vaatu,

311
00:22:50,894 --> 00:22:52,762
I let chaos into the world?

312
00:22:52,764 --> 00:22:54,231
Precisely.

313
00:22:54,233 --> 00:22:55,931
The human and spirit realms

314
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:57,966
are headed toward annihilation,

315
00:22:57,968 --> 00:23:00,904
and it's all your fault.

316
00:23:04,377 --> 00:23:07,314
Raava, I found you.

317
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:23,320
Should we pull her up?

318
00:23:23,322 --> 00:23:24,622
No.

319
00:23:24,624 --> 00:23:28,293
She is connecting with
her deepest Avatar memories.

320
00:23:28,295 --> 00:23:30,563
She must confront her own past

321
00:23:30,565 --> 00:23:32,967
if she is to move forward.

322
00:23:32,969 --> 00:23:39,142
We can only hope
that she survives her ordeal.

323
00:23:39,144 --> 00:23:41,778
The human and spirit realms
are headed

324
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,380
toward annihilation,

325
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:46,352
and it's all your fault.

326
00:23:46,354 --> 00:23:48,890
This is why
humans have no place

327
00:23:48,892 --> 00:23:51,526
interfering in the business
of spirits.

328
00:23:51,528 --> 00:23:53,427
This world is home
to all of us,

329
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:56,029
and what happens here
is everyone's business.

330
00:23:56,031 --> 00:23:57,130
Thanks to you,

331
00:23:57,132 --> 00:23:59,298
this world may cease to exist!

332
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,737
I only hope
I can track down Vaatu

333
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:03,039
before it's too late.

334
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,406
Let me help you.

335
00:24:04,408 --> 00:24:06,307
I don't want your help.

336
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:10,177
Don't interfere with me
again, human!

337
00:24:11,713 --> 00:24:13,013
Let's get moving.

338
00:24:33,702 --> 00:24:34,835
Do you see that, mula?

339
00:24:34,837 --> 00:24:36,571
People.

340
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:39,108
And they have some kind
of wind power.

341
00:24:41,111 --> 00:24:42,877
More humans!

342
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:43,878
I found you.

343
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,879
Aah!

344
00:24:44,881 --> 00:24:46,782
Wait! I'm friendly!

345
00:25:02,498 --> 00:25:03,432
Huh?

346
00:25:14,878 --> 00:25:16,978
The legends are true.

347
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,047
Another lion turtle city.

348
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:22,084
And it's flying.

349
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:28,233
I have got to get over there.

350
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,211
There.

351
00:25:37,213 --> 00:25:39,049
Okay, mula.

352
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:41,689
Wish me luck.

353
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:48,829
Oh, no...

354
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:03,142
Wow.

355
00:26:04,441 --> 00:26:06,576
Hi, how are you?

356
00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:08,512
I'm Wan.

357
00:26:08,514 --> 00:26:11,650
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but it's been a while

358
00:26:11,652 --> 00:26:13,186
since I've seen other humans.

359
00:26:13,188 --> 00:26:15,727
Where did you come from,
stranger?

360
00:26:15,729 --> 00:26:18,296
Another lion turtle city
far away.

361
00:26:18,298 --> 00:26:21,097
For the past two years, I've
been living among the spirits

362
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:22,467
and exploring the wilds.

363
00:26:22,469 --> 00:26:26,140
Remarkable.
Come. Sit with us.

364
00:26:26,142 --> 00:26:30,080
We would love to hear
of your travels.

365
00:26:51,883 --> 00:26:54,118
Vaatu.

366
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,389
So we meet again, human.

367
00:26:58,391 --> 00:27:01,291
Why is the great spirit
of darkness here

368
00:27:01,293 --> 00:27:02,692
but not his other half?

369
00:27:02,694 --> 00:27:06,394
Uh, I'll explain later.

370
00:27:06,396 --> 00:27:09,066
Leave these people in peace.

371
00:27:09,068 --> 00:27:11,266
They've done nothing
to harm you.

372
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:37,627
Be gone.

373
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,935
How are you feeling
since our split, Raava?

374
00:27:49,937 --> 00:27:53,544
I've never been better.

375
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,945
When harmonic convergence comes,

376
00:27:55,947 --> 00:28:01,413
I will destroy you forever.

377
00:28:02,617 --> 00:28:05,824
I told you not to interfere.

378
00:28:05,826 --> 00:28:07,192
I had to do something.

379
00:28:07,194 --> 00:28:08,558
These people were in danger.

380
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,491
Great spirit of light,

381
00:28:10,493 --> 00:28:12,258
we thank you for your help.

382
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,730
But how did you become split
from Vaatu?

383
00:28:15,732 --> 00:28:19,938
Ask him.

384
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,006
It wasn't my fault.

385
00:28:21,008 --> 00:28:23,107
Vaatu tricked me
into freeing him.

386
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:24,674
I'd take it all back
if I could.

387
00:28:24,676 --> 00:28:26,175
It's too late for that.

388
00:28:26,177 --> 00:28:28,244
Now that Vaatu is free,

389
00:28:28,246 --> 00:28:30,883
he is turning
other spirits dark.

390
00:28:30,885 --> 00:28:33,285
The more spirits he turns,

391
00:28:33,287 --> 00:28:35,719
the stronger he becomes.

392
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:37,120
He's getting bigger,

393
00:28:37,122 --> 00:28:39,190
and you're getting smaller.

394
00:28:39,192 --> 00:28:43,631
As darkness grows, light fades.

395
00:28:45,866 --> 00:28:48,131
I'm sorry for endangering
your village,

396
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:52,035
but I promise
to set things right.

397
00:28:52,037 --> 00:28:53,739
How?

398
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:57,013
Great lion turtle,

399
00:28:57,015 --> 00:28:58,849
I ask that you grant me
the power of air

400
00:28:58,851 --> 00:29:01,350
so that I can defeat Vaatu
before it's too late.

401
00:29:01,352 --> 00:29:05,987
You already carry
the power of fire.

402
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:12,000
No human has ever held
two elements at the same time.

403
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:13,602
I'm not like other humans.

404
00:29:13,604 --> 00:29:15,204
I can learn to do it.

405
00:29:15,206 --> 00:29:18,273
Hmm, perhaps.

406
00:29:18,275 --> 00:29:22,441
But to do so, Raava
must hold the power for you

407
00:29:22,443 --> 00:29:24,541
until you master it.

408
00:29:24,543 --> 00:29:28,479
Ancient one, why would I
do that for a human?

409
00:29:28,481 --> 00:29:31,384
Especially one who's caused
so much trouble?

410
00:29:31,386 --> 00:29:34,652
Raava, please, I can't let
the world fall into chaos

411
00:29:34,654 --> 00:29:36,552
because of my mistake.

412
00:29:36,554 --> 00:29:38,319
Neither of us
can defeat Vaatu alone,

413
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:40,221
but together we have a chance.

414
00:29:40,223 --> 00:29:42,158
You may be right.

415
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,096
Very well.

416
00:29:44,098 --> 00:29:47,567
I will help you to master
the power of air.

417
00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:48,935
Thank you.

418
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:50,971
And in return, I will help you

419
00:29:50,973 --> 00:29:52,840
restore balance to the world.

420
00:29:56,005 --> 00:29:59,540
What's this harmonic thing
Vaatu was talking about?

421
00:29:59,542 --> 00:30:01,509
Harmonic convergence.

422
00:30:01,511 --> 00:30:02,777
That is when Vaatu and I

423
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:04,782
must battle
for the fate of the world.

424
00:30:04,784 --> 00:30:06,984
How long do we have until then?

425
00:30:06,986 --> 00:30:08,918
About a year in your time.

426
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,854
Then we better start training.

427
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:18,324
All right,
I'm ready to try air.

428
00:30:18,326 --> 00:30:19,759
How's this gonna work?

429
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:21,694
The only way for me to give you

430
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,261
the other element is to pass

431
00:30:23,263 --> 00:30:26,063
through your body
and combine our energies.

432
00:30:26,065 --> 00:30:27,664
Great.
So you've done this before.

433
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:31,367
No. This has never
even been attempted.

434
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:33,502
It is very dangerous.

435
00:30:33,504 --> 00:30:35,572
That's what they said about
living in the spirit wilds,

436
00:30:35,574 --> 00:30:37,542
and I survived that.

437
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,280
I'm ready.
Give me the air.

438
00:30:53,062 --> 00:30:55,765
It feels completely different.

439
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:59,733
If you and Vaatu have the same
fight every 10,000 years,

440
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:01,433
why hasn't one of you
destroyed the other?

441
00:31:01,435 --> 00:31:04,103
He cannot destroy light
any more

442
00:31:04,105 --> 00:31:05,439
than I can destroy darkness.

443
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:08,710
One cannot exist
without the other.

444
00:31:08,712 --> 00:31:12,248
Even if I defeat Vaatu
in this encounter,

445
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:16,286
darkness will grow inside me
until he emerges again.

446
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:19,955
The same will hold true
if Vaatu defeats me.

447
00:31:19,957 --> 00:31:21,357
That doesn't sound so bad.

448
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:22,959
Even if Vaatu wins,
you'll come back.

449
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:26,630
Yes, but you will
probably not survive to see it.

450
00:31:26,632 --> 00:31:29,466
Vaatu will destroy the world
as you know it.

451
00:31:29,468 --> 00:31:33,703
Darkness will cover the earth
for 10,000 years.

452
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:36,341
If I'm gonna help you
battle Vaatu,

453
00:31:36,343 --> 00:31:39,281
then I should visit
more lion turtles.

454
00:31:39,283 --> 00:31:41,651
Why is there so much conflict

455
00:31:41,653 --> 00:31:44,184
between humans and spirits
in the first place?

456
00:31:44,186 --> 00:31:47,323
This physical world
is where humans come from.

457
00:31:47,325 --> 00:31:49,995
Spirits come from
another realm.

458
00:31:49,997 --> 00:31:52,267
At the north and South poles,

459
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:54,670
the two realms intersect.

460
00:31:54,672 --> 00:31:56,939
Over time,
more and more spirits

461
00:31:56,941 --> 00:32:00,345
have drifted into this world.

462
00:32:00,347 --> 00:32:02,782
Humans have been forced apart,

463
00:32:02,784 --> 00:32:05,385
settling on the lion turtles
who protect them

464
00:32:05,387 --> 00:32:08,256
and losing touch
with each other.

465
00:32:08,258 --> 00:32:09,558
Most people think they live

466
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,927
in the only human city
in the world.

467
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,364
Most humans
think only of themselves,

468
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:16,098
no matter
how many others are around.

469
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,531
When you pass through me,

470
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:21,336
I feel an incredible rush
of power.

471
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:32,721
I feel like I'm changing.

472
00:32:32,723 --> 00:32:34,893
The more we practice,
the stronger I become.

473
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,402
Smells like smoke.

474
00:32:39,404 --> 00:32:41,135
Humans are nearby.

475
00:32:41,137 --> 00:32:44,672
Let's check it out.

476
00:32:57,592 --> 00:33:00,026
A spirit!

477
00:33:02,596 --> 00:33:04,798
Easy there, fellas.
We're friendly.

478
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,800
I can't believe it.
Wan?

479
00:33:07,802 --> 00:33:10,837
Jaya!
What are you doing out here?

480
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:13,138
Ha ha!
You inspired us.

481
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,107
Once we heard that you survived
out in the wilds,

482
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:16,475
we decided to try it too.

483
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:18,576
Where's Yao?
Did he come with you?

484
00:33:18,578 --> 00:33:23,815
Yes, but sadly,
he didn't make it.

485
00:33:23,817 --> 00:33:27,485
We... we lost a lot
of good men along the way.

486
00:33:27,487 --> 00:33:31,026
So why were you protecting
this spirit?

487
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:33,028
This is Raava.
Don't worry.

488
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,830
She's not like the dark spirits
you've probably run into.

489
00:33:35,832 --> 00:33:37,065
Dark spirits?

490
00:33:37,067 --> 00:33:38,366
What's the difference?

491
00:33:38,368 --> 00:33:40,802
We throw fire at any spirit
we see around here.

492
00:33:40,804 --> 00:33:42,604
Just like they attack any man.

493
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:45,375
You have no idea
what you're doing!

494
00:33:45,377 --> 00:33:48,010
You're only
making things worse.

495
00:33:48,012 --> 00:33:50,112
The spirits are coming back!

496
00:33:50,114 --> 00:33:51,915
Let's wipe 'em out this time.

497
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:54,220
We'll burn down
this whole forest if we have to.

498
00:33:54,222 --> 00:33:55,690
What happened to you?

499
00:33:55,692 --> 00:33:57,193
When did you become so violent?

500
00:33:57,195 --> 00:33:59,528
You showed me we could change
the world if we just stopped

501
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,795
being so afraid.

502
00:34:00,797 --> 00:34:02,896
Now we're doing it.

503
00:34:02,898 --> 00:34:05,066
This isn't what I had in mind.

504
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:13,677
Get out of the forest, humans.

505
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,878
Wait.

506
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,350
We can resolve this peacefully.

507
00:34:17,352 --> 00:34:20,422
Stinky?
You came back.

508
00:34:20,424 --> 00:34:21,922
It's good to see you again.

509
00:34:21,924 --> 00:34:24,056
You and Raava are just in time
to help us

510
00:34:24,058 --> 00:34:27,424
clear these tree-killing
fire-lovers out of here

511
00:34:27,426 --> 00:34:29,226
just like the old days.

512
00:34:29,228 --> 00:34:30,930
You are the one
who's getting cleared out.

513
00:34:30,932 --> 00:34:33,167
There's no need for violence.

514
00:34:33,169 --> 00:34:35,471
I know there must be a way
to work out a compromise.

515
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:38,308
You have a good heart, stinky.

516
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,407
These fire tossers
aren't like you.

517
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:42,976
Spirits like him
killed our friends.

518
00:34:42,978 --> 00:34:44,779
I can't let them
get away with that.

519
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:58,061
We are protectors
of the forest.

520
00:34:58,063 --> 00:35:00,264
We won't let you burn it down.

521
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:03,001
It's Vaatu.
He's growing stronger,

522
00:35:03,003 --> 00:35:05,803
using their anger
to turn them to his side.

523
00:35:09,209 --> 00:35:11,743
Wipe them out!

524
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:18,415
Stop, please!

525
00:35:23,617 --> 00:35:26,148
Raava, we need to combine
our energies.

526
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:29,084
Maybe then we'll have
enough power to stop this.

527
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:35,226
Enough!

528
00:35:35,228 --> 00:35:36,960
You need to stop fighting now

529
00:35:36,962 --> 00:35:38,660
before you destroy each other.

530
00:35:41,263 --> 00:35:44,298
Stinky, w-what happened?

531
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,268
He's controlling
all four elements.

532
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,572
Wan, I have to leave
your body, or I'll destroy you.

533
00:35:51,574 --> 00:35:54,239
No.
It's working.

534
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:58,076
If you leave,
the fighting will start again.

535
00:35:58,078 --> 00:36:00,079
Wan!

536
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:16,597
We have to go back.

537
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:18,166
Don't bother.

538
00:36:18,168 --> 00:36:22,804
Your human friends
have already been annihilated.

539
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:27,340
- No!
- Enjoy your final days.

540
00:36:27,342 --> 00:36:30,444
See you at the end
of the world.

541
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:39,252
- Raava.
- I'm sorry, Wan.

542
00:36:57,336 --> 00:36:59,705
We're almost there.

543
00:36:59,707 --> 00:37:01,475
I was wrong about you, Wan.

544
00:37:01,477 --> 00:37:04,881
I had no idea
that humans were capable

545
00:37:04,883 --> 00:37:07,584
of such nobility and courage.

546
00:37:07,586 --> 00:37:11,723
I'm sorry that we do not have
much more time together.

547
00:37:11,725 --> 00:37:13,725
Let's not give up
before the battle's even begun.

548
00:37:13,727 --> 00:37:15,227
Who knows what will happen?

549
00:37:15,229 --> 00:37:19,132
After all, this is
my first harmonic convergence.

550
00:37:24,274 --> 00:37:28,679
This is the Southern portal
to the spirit world.

551
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:32,418
Here, Vaatu and I
will do battle once again

552
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:37,455
at the place
where the two worlds meet.

553
00:37:49,063 --> 00:37:52,799
Are you ready
for our final battle, Raava?

554
00:37:52,801 --> 00:37:55,803
Thanks to our friend
separating us,

555
00:37:55,805 --> 00:37:58,070
I think this time,

556
00:37:58,072 --> 00:38:01,404
I may be rid of you
once and for all.

557
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:05,074
Before you get to her,
you'll have to go through me.

558
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:09,277
No human can stand against me.

559
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:11,412
Haven't you heard the legends?

560
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,582
I'm not a regular human
anymore.

561
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,424
Uhh!

562
00:38:30,096 --> 00:38:33,799
I lived 10,000 lifetimes

563
00:38:33,801 --> 00:38:35,936
before the first of your kind

564
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,806
crawled out of the mud.

565
00:38:43,145 --> 00:38:44,512
Aah!

566
00:38:44,514 --> 00:38:46,450
Oof... oh!

567
00:38:46,452 --> 00:38:49,090
It was I who broke
through the divide

568
00:38:49,092 --> 00:38:51,859
that separated
the plane of spirits

569
00:38:51,861 --> 00:38:54,861
from the material world!

570
00:39:01,534 --> 00:39:05,204
To hate me
is to give me breath.

571
00:39:05,206 --> 00:39:08,880
To fight me
is to give me strength.

572
00:39:08,882 --> 00:39:12,585
Now prepare to face oblivion!

573
00:39:20,698 --> 00:39:22,467
Raava!

574
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:25,507
The only way to win
is together.

575
00:39:27,443 --> 00:39:28,709
Ah!

576
00:39:51,562 --> 00:39:53,562
Aah!

577
00:40:21,534 --> 00:40:23,734
I have to leave you.

578
00:40:23,736 --> 00:40:26,603
If I stay any longer,
you will die.

579
00:40:26,605 --> 00:40:29,038
It doesn't matter.

580
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,641
If you leave me now,
Vaatu will destroy everything.

581
00:40:32,643 --> 00:40:34,877
We have to finish this
together!

582
00:41:01,743 --> 00:41:06,486
The harmonic convergence
is about to begin.

583
00:41:06,488 --> 00:41:10,088
The era of Raava is over.

584
00:41:39,556 --> 00:41:42,426
Aah!

585
00:41:51,002 --> 00:41:54,172
We are bonded forever.

586
00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:36,949
This is your prison now.

587
00:42:36,951 --> 00:42:39,951
And I will close the portal
so no human will ever be able

588
00:42:39,953 --> 00:42:41,320
to physically enter
the spirit world

589
00:42:41,322 --> 00:42:43,422
and release you.

590
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:00,904
The spirits must stop
fighting with humans

591
00:43:00,906 --> 00:43:03,372
and return to their home
in the spirit world.

592
00:43:03,374 --> 00:43:05,707
I will teach men
to respect the spirits

593
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:07,742
so that balance
will be maintained.

594
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:16,451
I will be the bridge
between our two worlds.

595
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:29,962
The world is entering
a new age.

596
00:43:29,964 --> 00:43:34,668
Our time protecting mankind
is over.

597
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:37,540
We will no longer give humans

598
00:43:37,542 --> 00:43:40,247
the power of the elements.

599
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:47,456
Different groups of people
must learn to live together.

600
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,727
This is my mission...
to use Raava's light spirit

601
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:53,263
to guide the world
toward peace.

602
00:44:00,374 --> 00:44:02,443
I'm sorry, Raava.

603
00:44:02,445 --> 00:44:05,277
I failed to bring peace.

604
00:44:05,279 --> 00:44:08,012
Even with Vaatu locked away,

605
00:44:08,014 --> 00:44:11,618
darkness still surrounds
humanity.

606
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:15,226
There wasn't enough time.

607
00:44:15,228 --> 00:44:17,261
Don't worry.

608
00:44:17,263 --> 00:44:20,732
We will be together
for all of your lifetimes.

609
00:44:20,734 --> 00:44:24,136
And we will never give up.

610
00:44:53,003 --> 00:44:55,506
I remember.

611
00:44:55,508 --> 00:44:58,209
Do you know who you are?

612
00:44:59,678 --> 00:45:01,646
My name is Korra.

613
00:45:01,648 --> 00:45:04,280
I'm the Avatar.

614
00:45:05,616 --> 00:45:08,521
We've been raising
this herd of air bison

615
00:45:08,523 --> 00:45:11,292
since the hundred year war.

616
00:45:11,294 --> 00:45:15,759
I never thought I'd be able
to present one to the Avatar.

617
00:45:15,761 --> 00:45:18,057
Thank you
for all your kindness.

618
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:20,126
I wonder how long
I've been away.

619
00:45:20,128 --> 00:45:22,261
That I cannot say,

620
00:45:22,263 --> 00:45:24,663
but you do not have
much time left.

621
00:45:24,665 --> 00:45:28,833
The harmonic convergence
is only weeks away.

622
00:45:28,835 --> 00:45:30,499
I have to close
the spirit portal

623
00:45:30,501 --> 00:45:32,667
before that happens.
