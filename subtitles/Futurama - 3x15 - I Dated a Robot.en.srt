00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:09,323  X1:257 X2:461 Y1:495 Y2:516
I Dated a Robot

2
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:34,532  X1:209 X2:512 Y1:456 Y2:516
<i>You're entering a realm</i>
<i>which is unusual.</i>

3
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:39,727  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:456 Y2:516
<i>Maybe it's magic or contains some</i>
<i>kind of monster. The second one.</i>

4
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:44,051  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:061 Y2:087
<i>Prepare to enter</i> The Scary Door.

5
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,450  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>Please send the man round back</i>
<i>and pick up Clyde Smith...</i>

6
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:52,329  X1:102 X2:610 Y1:061 Y2:121
<i>... a professional gambler who 's</i>
<i>about to have an unfortunate accident.</i>

7
00:01:00,653 --> 00:01:03,565  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:061 Y2:088
A casino where I'm winning?

8
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:07,487  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:061 Y2:121
That car must have killed me.
I must be in heaven.

9
00:01:11,213 --> 00:01:13,443  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:061 Y2:087
A casino where I always win?

10
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:17,208  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:061 Y2:127
That's boring.
I must really be... in hell!

11
00:01:17,413 --> 00:01:21,804  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:061 Y2:127
No. You're not in heaven or hell.
You're on an airplane.

12
00:01:23,973 --> 00:01:27,249  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:061 Y2:127
A gremlin's destroying the plane!
You've gotta believe me!

13
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:30,763  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:456 Y2:516
Why should I believe you?
You're Hitler.

14
00:01:30,973 --> 00:01:34,170  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:490 Y2:516
Eva Braun, help me!

15
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:38,970  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:061 Y2:126
- Saw it coming.
- I just saw something incredibly cool.

16
00:01:39,173 --> 00:01:42,563  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:061 Y2:126
A big floating ball that lit up with
every color in the rainbow...

17
00:01:42,813 --> 00:01:47,762  X1:182 X2:538 Y1:061 Y2:121
...plus some new ones that
were so beautiful I cried.

18
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:50,692  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:456 Y2:516
- In front of Discount Shoe Outlet?
- Yeah.

19
00:01:50,853 --> 00:01:53,162  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:456 Y2:516
They have a kid wear that
to attract customers.

20
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:56,166  X1:224 X2:492 Y1:061 Y2:122
I don't care if it was
a dork in a costume.

21
00:01:56,413 --> 00:02:01,407  X1:105 X2:609 Y1:061 Y2:126
For a moment, I felt the heartbeat of
creation, and it was one with my own.

22
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:04,650  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Big deal.
- We all feel like that all the time.

23
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:08,772  X1:102 X2:613 Y1:450 Y2:516
- You don't hear us gassing on about it.
- How can you be so blasé?

24
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:13,768  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's the year 3000, yet you sit around
like it's the boring time I came from.

25
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:17,767  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:516
Boring? Wasn't that the period when
they cracked the human genome...

26
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:20,128  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:490 Y2:516
...and boy bands roamed the earth?

27
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,528  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:494 Y2:516
Yeah. But now it's the distant future.

28
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:25,366  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:516
Why aren't we doing
everything I ever dreamed of?

29
00:02:25,573 --> 00:02:29,122  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:451 Y2:516
- You know what might be a hoot?
- No. Why would I know that?

30
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:33,332  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:455 Y2:516
Let's take Fry to do everything
he ever wanted to do.

31
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:35,364  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Everything?
- Except that.

32
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:42,167  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:451 Y2:516
So your fantasy has always been
to destroys a planet?

33
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:45,849  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:490 Y2:516
Yeah. What did they ever do for me?

34
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:54,245  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:451 Y2:516
The most humdrum activities seem
almost exciting through your eyes.

35
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:57,291  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:451 Y2:516
- What next?
- I wanna see the edge of the universe.

36
00:02:57,453 --> 00:03:00,650  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Sounds cool.
- Funny, you live in the universe...

37
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:04,089  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:456 Y2:516
...but you never do these things
till someone visits.

38
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:09,965  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:490 Y2:516
There it is! The edge of the universe.

39
00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:27,532  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:450 Y2:516
Far out. So there's an infinite
number of parallel universes?

40
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:31,561  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:451 Y2:516
- No, just the two.
- Well, I'm sure that's enough.

41
00:03:31,773 --> 00:03:34,810  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm sick of parallel Bender lording
his cowboy hat over me.

42
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:37,282  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:489 Y2:516
Let's move on to Fry's next fantasy.

43
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:44,292  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:490 Y2:516
Bow before your master, puny mortals.

44
00:03:49,253 --> 00:03:52,882  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Mommy, why is that man like that?
- Don't look at him.

45
00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:56,771  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:489 Y2:516
That was fun. Let's give him a treat.

46
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:09,006  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:490 Y2:516
Keep your palms flat.

47
00:04:11,613 --> 00:04:14,173  X1:233 X2:481 Y1:490 Y2:516
The tongue tickles.

48
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:21,611  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:451 Y2:516
These new hands are great.
I'll break them in tonight.

49
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:23,769  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:489 Y2:516
It's been quite an hour and a half.

50
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:26,806  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:451 Y2:516
Two fantasies left: to be invisible
in a chocolate factory...

51
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:29,771  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:451 Y2:516
...and to be romantically linked
with a celebrity.

52
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:33,323  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:451 Y2:516
I could pound your head till you think
that's what happened.

53
00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:37,486  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:451 Y2:516
Wait, hold on.
It is possible to meet any celebrity.

54
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:40,571  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:451 Y2:516
- It is?
- Of course. You should read a blimp.

55
00:04:41,693 --> 00:04:45,811  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:450 Y2:516
"Download a celebrity."
What part of that do I understand?

56
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:50,808  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's simple. You can download
a celebrity into a blank robot.

57
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:53,283  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:494 Y2:516
I have an idea. Let's do that.

58
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:59,127  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:490 Y2:516
Onto the Internet you go.

59
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:03,411  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:455 Y2:516
While you're there, pick me up
a few credit card numbers.

60
00:05:12,293 --> 00:05:14,727  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:494 Y2:516
Kirk could kick Picard's ass.

61
00:05:14,973 --> 00:05:17,885  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:456 Y2:516
At least Picard had the guts
to admit he was bald.

62
00:05:18,053 --> 00:05:19,566  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:495 Y2:516
You take that back.

63
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:20,882  X1:322 X2:392 Y1:490 Y2:516
eBay.

64
00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:26,242  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:061 Y2:126
Are there no further bids
for this exquisite galaxy?

65
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:29,405  X1:222 X2:493 Y1:061 Y2:121
Sold to the being of
inconceivable horror.

66
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:32,607  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Will a money order be okay?
- Yes.

67
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:40,209  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:455 Y2:516
- Where's the celebrity dating place?
- Let's search the Web.

68
00:05:40,653 --> 00:05:41,642  X1:286 X2:429 Y1:495 Y2:516
Over there.

69
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:53,324  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
Welcome to Nappster.
Let's see who we've got in stock.

70
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:58,525  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Gwyneth Paltrow?
- Nah. I read she drinks human blood.

71
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:02,527  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:451 Y2:516
How about Cleopatra, whose
beauty destroyed mighty empires?

72
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:05,452  X1:202 X2:512 Y1:455 Y2:516
I'd prefer someone
with shaved underarms.

73
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:08,042  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:451 Y2:516
Do you have anything with a
Lucy Liu feel to it?

74
00:06:08,253 --> 00:06:11,450  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:451 Y2:516
Nothing like that.
Although we do have Lucy Liu.

75
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:15,851  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:456 Y2:516
Only woman to be named <i>People's</i>
Sexiest Woman of the Year twice:

76
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:18,163  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:490 Y2:516
In 2003 and then again in 2063.

77
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:21,570  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:494 Y2:516
I'd like the 2003 model.

78
00:06:24,293 --> 00:06:26,761  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:495 Y2:516
I found her! What do I do now?

79
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:31,928  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:061 Y2:122
Download her. Let's just put
a blank robot in the drive.

80
00:06:42,613 --> 00:06:44,843  X1:293 X2:423 Y1:495 Y2:516
It worked.

81
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:49,882  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:489 Y2:516
You're one sexy man, Philip J. Fry.

82
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:53,086  X1:231 X2:484 Y1:490 Y2:516
It worked perfectly.

83
00:07:00,173 --> 00:07:02,528  X1:149 X2:565 Y1:490 Y2:516
Well, you downloaded Lucy Liu.

84
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:05,486  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:451 Y2:516
Are you just gonna stare
vacantly at her?

85
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:11,971  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:451 Y2:516
I find your slack-jawed stare
very attractive, Philip J. Fry.

86
00:07:12,213 --> 00:07:13,805  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:495 Y2:516
Hear that? She likes me.

87
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:16,732  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:451 Y2:516
Well, duh!
She's programmed to like you.

88
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:21,006  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:451 Y2:516
But this is Lucy Liu, the only
good actress of the 21 st century.

89
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:22,765  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:494 Y2:516
She's more than software.

90
00:07:22,973 --> 00:07:25,533  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:490 Y2:516
Would you like to register me?

91
00:07:25,693 --> 00:07:29,971  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Not right now.
- I'll remind you later, you hot stud.

92
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:32,568  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:490 Y2:516
So, what do you feel like doing?

93
00:07:32,813 --> 00:07:36,123  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Would you like to register me?
- I said later.

94
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:41,447  X1:126 X2:588 Y1:494 Y2:516
When I feel so stuffed I can't eat...

95
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:44,326  X1:197 X2:517 Y1:456 Y2:516
...I use the restroom,
and then I can eat more.

96
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:49,203  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:456 Y2:516
You should write a book. People need
to know about the "can eat more."

97
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:53,372  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:450 Y2:516
You're just like I thought
you'd be from your movies.

98
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,929  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:451 Y2:516
My personality is mathematically
derived from my movies...

99
00:07:57,093 --> 00:08:00,165  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:451 Y2:516
...proportionately weighted
by box office receipts.

100
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:31,129  X1:274 X2:442 Y1:455 Y2:516
- You're cute.
- You're cute.

101
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,370  X1:324 X2:391 Y1:456 Y2:516
- You.
- You.

102
00:08:34,573 --> 00:08:38,646  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:516
Oh, dear. She's stuck in
an infinite loop and he's an idiot.

103
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:40,531  X1:229 X2:485 Y1:489 Y2:516
That's love for you.

104
00:08:40,773 --> 00:08:45,324  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:451 Y2:516
Humans dating robots is sick.
You people wonder why I'm still single?

105
00:08:45,573 --> 00:08:49,122  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters
are dating humans!

106
00:08:49,373 --> 00:08:51,204  X1:216 X2:499 Y1:489 Y2:516
This is Fry's decision.

107
00:08:51,373 --> 00:08:54,729  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:456 Y2:516
And he made it wrong,
so it's time for us to interfere.

108
00:08:56,893 --> 00:09:00,329  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:455 Y2:516
She doesn't love you. She can't.
She's a machine...

109
00:09:00,493 --> 00:09:04,281  X1:171 X2:543 Y1:451 Y2:516
Stay away from our women!
You've got metal fever, boy!

110
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:07,769  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:451 Y2:516
So what if I love a robot?
It's not hurting anybody.

111
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:12,603  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516
He never took middle school hygiene.
He never saw the propaganda film.

112
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:17,051  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:455 Y2:516
It's just lucky I keep a copy
in the VCR at all times.

113
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:22,330  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:490 Y2:516
Ordinary human dating.

114
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:27,363  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's enjoyable, and it serves
an important purpose.

115
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:33,331  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:451 Y2:516
But when a human dates an artificial
mate, there is no purpose...

116
00:09:33,493 --> 00:09:37,406  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:451 Y2:516
...only enjoyment.
And that leads to tragedy.

117
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:45,482  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:490 Y2:516
Neat-o! A Marilyn Monroe-Bot.

118
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:50,124  X1:120 X2:594 Y1:489 Y2:516
You're a dreamboat, Billy Everyteen.

119
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,848  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:451 Y2:516
Harmless fun?
Let's see what happens next.

120
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:59,249  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:490 Y2:516
Do you want to walk your dog?

121
00:09:59,453 --> 00:10:02,684  X1:221 X2:493 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'd rather make out
with my Monroe-Bot.

122
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:07,244  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:456 Y2:516
Do you want to get a paper route
and earn some cash?

123
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:11,924  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:516
No, thanks. I'd rather make out
with my Monroe-Bot.

124
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:15,883  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:451 Y2:516
Do you want to come over?
We can make out together.

125
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:18,323  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:495 Y2:516
Your house is across the street.

126
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:22,048  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's an awfully long way
to go for making out.

127
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:24,363  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:490 Y2:516
What went wrong in that scene?

128
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:28,048  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:451 Y2:516
Ordinarily, Billy would work hard
to make money with his paper route...

129
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:31,171  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:451 Y2:516
...then use the money
to buy dinner for Mavis...

130
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,803  X1:149 X2:565 Y1:451 Y2:516
...thus earning a slim chance
to perform the reproductive act.

131
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:38,972  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:451 Y2:516
But if teens can date robots,
why should he bother?

132
00:10:39,213 --> 00:10:43,604  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:450 Y2:516
Why should anyone bother? Let's look
at Billy's planet a year later.

133
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:48,728  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:456 Y2:516
Where are all the football stars?
And where are the biochemists?

134
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:53,563  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:516
They're trapped. Trapped in
the soft, viselike grip of robot lips.

135
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:59,492  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:451 Y2:516
All civilization was an effort
to impress the opposite sex.

136
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:03,604  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:495 Y2:516
And sometimes the same sex.

137
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:08,762  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:516
Now, let's skip forward 80 years
into the future. Where's Billy?

138
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,483  X1:301 X2:415 Y1:495 Y2:516
Farewell.

139
00:11:15,013 --> 00:11:18,972  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:450 Y2:516
The next day, Billy's planet
was destroyed by aliens.

140
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:27,172  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:451 Y2:516
Have you guessed the name
of Billy's planet? It was Earth!

141
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:29,847  X1:240 X2:476 Y1:061 Y2:083
Don't date robots!

142
00:11:30,093 --> 00:11:32,482  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>Brought to you by</i>
<i>The Space Pope.</i>

143
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:36,402  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:451 Y2:516
Did that make any impression
on you? Fry?

144
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:45,529  X1:124 X2:588 Y1:451 Y2:516
I knew I should have shown him
<i>Electro Gonorrhea: The Noisy Killer.</i>

145
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:49,283  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:490 Y2:516
What is the world coming to?

146
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:54,567  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:450 Y2:516
That Fry's a sicko pervert, I tell you.
Dating a robot, it's an atrosamacy!

147
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:59,967  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:450 Y2:516
- But Fry's our friend, Bender.
- Will you stifle there, meat bag?

148
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:04,371  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:451 Y2:516
- You stifle, Bender.
- Finally you're standing up to him.

149
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:06,524  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:490 Y2:516
Although he is completely right.

150
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:10,123  X1:185 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:516
We've got to stem this
tidal wave of moral decay.

151
00:12:10,373 --> 00:12:13,843  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's time to shut down
Nappster. com.

152
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:17,772  X1:245 X2:472 Y1:489 Y2:516
Who's in charge?

153
00:12:17,973 --> 00:12:21,522  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:516
If you're an investor, you can
dump your money in the hole.

154
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:24,167  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Listen, you Internet nerd.
- Listening.

155
00:12:24,373 --> 00:12:26,568  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:490 Y2:516
Your company promotes wrong love.

156
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:31,568  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:450 Y2:516
If you don't shut down, the only thing
wired about you will be your jaw.

157
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:36,727  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:451 Y2:516
The Internet is about the free exchange
and sale of other people's ideas.

158
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:40,602  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:450 Y2:516
- We've done nothing wrong.
- Help! I'm being held prisoner.

159
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:42,604  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:495 Y2:516
Someone in trouble is.

160
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:48,524  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:455 Y2:516
No. Stay out. There's a guy going
for the Tetris world record in there.

161
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:55,211  X1:263 X2:453 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Who are you?
- Don't hurt us.

162
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:58,809  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:061 Y2:127
Help me! They've been holding
me prisoner for 800 years.

163
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:02,847  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:451 Y2:516
The real Lucy Liu!
The one you can see a movie of.

164
00:13:03,013 --> 00:13:04,492  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:489 Y2:516
What's your problem?

165
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:09,130  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:061 Y2:126
Those sweaty nerds are making
illegal copies of us.

166
00:13:11,093 --> 00:13:12,526  X1:307 X2:408 Y1:061 Y2:082
It hurts!

167
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,723  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:450 Y2:516
Open this door. Don't make me
call the maintenance guy.

168
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:20,289  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:061 Y2:122
- It's a bluff.
- We can't take that chance. Move!

169
00:13:20,493 --> 00:13:24,691  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:061 Y2:121
- Please pick me up before you go-go.
- She asked first.

170
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:37,368  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:490 Y2:516
Are you Lucy Liu?

171
00:13:39,413 --> 00:13:40,402  X1:324 X2:391 Y1:495 Y2:516
Sure.

172
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:51,644  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:450 Y2:516
We're doomed! They got the head.
They uncovered the sign.

173
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:54,321  X1:214 X2:500 Y1:451 Y2:516
The world will learn
we're cyber-criminals.

174
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:58,572  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:516
We'd have gotten away with it if
it weren't for those meddling adults.

175
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:01,201  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:489 Y2:516
We'll stop them. They like Lucy Liu?

176
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:06,527  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:450 Y2:516
We'll give them all the Lucy Liu they
can handle. Hand me that backup disk.

177
00:14:19,173 --> 00:14:23,405  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:061 Y2:121
Did you see me escaping?
I was all like:

178
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:27,242  X1:200 X2:514 Y1:061 Y2:126
Thanks for rescuing me.
Especially you, Bender.

179
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:30,371  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:061 Y2:126
Quite a masculine piece of metal,
aren't you?

180
00:14:30,613 --> 00:14:32,365  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:061 Y2:083
Don't look at me like that.

181
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:36,367  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:061 Y2:127
If you're thinking of crossing
the line, you can forget it.

182
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:38,330  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:061 Y2:088
Bender don't bend that way.

183
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:41,212  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:061 Y2:088
Hey, look. It's another Lucy Liu-Bot.

184
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:45,201  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:490 Y2:516
I am Lucy Liu. Give me your spines.

185
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,164  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hey, what the...?

186
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:52,685  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:493 Y2:516
Take this, and that, and one of these.

187
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:57,609  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:061 Y2:126
Cut it out.
I don't need this kind of publicity.

188
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:08,723  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:061 Y2:126
All right, Liu. Time to kick
your frosty, well-toned ass.

189
00:15:18,813 --> 00:15:21,088  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:490 Y2:516
Then along came Bender.

190
00:15:22,253 --> 00:15:25,006  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:489 Y2:516
Looks like you're retaining water.

191
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:33,568  X1:102 X2:612 Y1:061 Y2:127
That was incredible, Bender. You're
like Jackie Chan before he got doughy.

192
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:36,731  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:492 Y2:516
Shucks, I wasn't afraid of that robot.

193
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:41,290  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm pretty brave once you get past
my macho exterior...

194
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:50,567  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:516
- It's an army of Lucy Lius!
- They're horrible.

195
00:15:51,293 --> 00:15:54,330  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:493 Y2:516
Take this, and that, and one of these.

196
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:58,446  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Robot Crouching Tiger.
- Robot Crane Style.

197
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:07,728  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:516
Now that's a wave of destruction
that's easy on the eyes.

198
00:16:13,413 --> 00:16:17,452  X1:113 X2:601 Y1:450 Y2:516
This is the best movie I've ever seen.
It has a vampire and an explosion.

199
00:16:17,613 --> 00:16:20,730  X1:211 X2:503 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's amazing the way
you notice two things.

200
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:24,482  X1:180 X2:532 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>No! Don 't open that coffin.</i>
<i>It's ticking.</i>

201
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:29,124  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>I have to, Alex. That coffin 's</i>
<i>not going to open itself.</i>

202
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:36,689  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:061 Y2:127
Let's hide in here.
It'll add to my box office gross.

203
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,723  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:061 Y2:126
- Fry?
- You guys came to watch me make out.

204
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:43,009  X1:245 X2:469 Y1:061 Y2:082
That is so sweet.

205
00:16:43,173 --> 00:16:46,324  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:061 Y2:121
Wait, is that the head
of who I think it's of?

206
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:49,366  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:061 Y2:087
Read the jar, Evelyn Wood. Doctor Z?

207
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:55,251  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:061 Y2:126
A herd of Lucy Liu are destroying
the city. Is yours acting normally?

208
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:57,529  X1:283 X2:432 Y1:061 Y2:082
Let me see.

209
00:16:58,773 --> 00:17:00,172  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:061 Y2:087
Yep. Why do you ask?

210
00:17:00,373 --> 00:17:03,968  X1:123 X2:591 Y1:456 Y2:516
<i>If you want to see the real vampire,</i>
<i>look in the mirror.</i>

211
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:07,091  X1:212 X2:501 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>I can 't. I'm a vampire.</i>

212
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:19,922  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:490 Y2:516
Why?

213
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:23,327  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:451 Y2:516
And Nappster says illegal copies
never hurt anybody.

214
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:25,808  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:061 Y2:087
Quick, this way.

215
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:32,042  X1:161 X2:553 Y1:490 Y2:516
Sorry, ladies. Employees only.

216
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:46,210  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:450 Y2:516
They're forming a human
pyramid... Of robots.

217
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:51,932  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:516
We weren't counting on them
being as smart as they are sexy.

218
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:54,124  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:490 Y2:516
A dangerous mistake to make.

219
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,848  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:516
- At least we've got food.
- Dr. Zoidberg, cut open that bag.

220
00:17:59,053 --> 00:18:00,850  X1:246 X2:470 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Hooray!
- And don't eat it.

221
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:10,048  X1:245 X2:470 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Data error.
- Do not compute.

222
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:18,008  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:451 Y2:516
Life was bad,
but now it's good forever!

223
00:18:36,613 --> 00:18:41,767  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:061 Y2:124
You'll be safe in here, sweetheart.
Get lost, Pavarotti.

224
00:18:43,773 --> 00:18:45,729  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:494 Y2:516
If I don't survive the corn...

225
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:51,047  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:451 Y2:516
...I love you as much as a man can
love a computerized image...

226
00:18:51,293 --> 00:18:52,726  X1:252 X2:464 Y1:495 Y2:516
...which is a lot.

227
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:56,642  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:456 Y2:516
Oh, Fry. I love you more
than the moon and the stars...

228
00:18:56,813 --> 00:18:59,885  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:456 Y2:516
...and the... Poetic image
number 37 not found.

229
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:06,209  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:490 Y2:516
What are you doing? Get down.

230
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:12,806  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:490 Y2:516
Light hot. Oil temperature rising.

231
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:15,169  X1:273 X2:442 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Oh, no.
- Malfunction.

232
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:19,292  X1:251 X2:464 Y1:450 Y2:516
- This ain't good.
- System error.

233
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:24,447  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:490 Y2:516
You saved us. Are you all right?

234
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:30,165  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:516
Yes, my love. I'll be just...
Massive corn clog in port seven.

235
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:32,728  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Are you the last copy of me?
- Yes.

236
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:35,322  X1:259 X2:457 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Erase her, Fry.
- What? No!

237
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:39,572  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:061 Y2:126
When you downloaded her without
my permission, you stole my image...

238
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:44,409  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:061 Y2:127
...and that's all I have. That and
the largest gold nugget in the world.

239
00:19:44,613 --> 00:19:46,843  X1:232 X2:483 Y1:451 Y2:516
I downloaded her
because I love you.

240
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:50,762  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:061 Y2:126
If you love the real me,
not just what you've seen in movies...

241
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:55,324  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:061 Y2:126
...genre-straddling lawyer shows
and articles in <i>People</i> magazine...

242
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:58,644  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:061 Y2:088
...you'll blank out that robot.

243
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,768  X1:296 X2:419 Y1:489 Y2:516
I'm sorry.

244
00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:11,812  X1:249 X2:466 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hug me, Liu-Bot.

245
00:20:23,053 --> 00:20:27,922  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'll always remember you, Fry.
Memory deleted.

246
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:31,645  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:490 Y2:516
I know it hurts, buddy.

247
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:36,648  X1:159 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:516
But at least you're not
in a sick relationship anymore.

248
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:40,567  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:451 Y2:516
And I guess now I can get
to know the real Lucy Liu.

249
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:45,364  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Yeah, at our wedding.
- It's true. Bender and I are in love.

250
00:20:45,573 --> 00:20:46,608  X1:291 X2:426 Y1:495 Y2:516
But... But...

251
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,486  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:489 Y2:516
Don't be a prude, Fry.
