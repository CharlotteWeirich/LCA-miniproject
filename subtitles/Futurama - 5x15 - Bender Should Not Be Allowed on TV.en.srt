00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:12,806
-Quit the show!
-Do the scene.

I once put a laugh track
on a sitcom that had no jokes in it.

-Hey, look! The prop guy has a lamp!
-Really?

306
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:24,686
-Aha!
-I was using that!

Listen up, because I've got
a climactic speech.

You, cameraman,

-You, director! Give me my motivation!
-You're angry.

Perfect! Viewers of the world,

Of course they do!

312
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:45,131
How about committing crimes and
violence? Again, the answer is yes.

313
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:49,292
But do we really want our kids
exposed to that kind of trash on TV?

00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:52,684
-I say absolutely not!
-Oh!

On the other hand, most, perhaps all,
the blame rests with the parents.

317

That's right, you!

318
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:06,810
And so I ask you this one question:

319
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:10,852
Have you ever tried simply
turning off the TV. . .

. . .sitting down with your children. . .

. . .and hitting them?

322
00:20:14,453 --> 00:20:17,525
-We're just so busy.
-Well, make time.

323
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:18,967
And cut!

324
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:24,209
Good enough. Splice in some reaction
shots of me and shove it on the air.

325
00:20:26,653 --> 00:20:30,089
Have you ever tried simply
turning off the TV...

326
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:32,164
...sitting down with your children...

327
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,527
...and hitting them?

328
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:38,807
Well, I'd say we all learned
a valuable lesson about TV there.

329
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:39,962
What was it?

330
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:43,967
That we should all take TV
a little less seriously.

331
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:47,125
And more importantly,
turn it off once in a while.

332
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:49,011
-Hear, hear!
-Darn right!

333
00:20:49,173 --> 00:20:50,970
So should we turn it off now?

334
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:55,126
-Well. . . . That depends what's on.
MAN: One now....

00:20:55,293 --> 00:20:59,605
-Nothing good.
-Let's just keep watching.
