1
00:00:00,704 --> 00:00:02,372
Earth.

2
00:00:02,374 --> 00:00:04,240
Fire.

3
00:00:04,242 --> 00:00:05,959
Air.

4
00:00:05,961 --> 00:00:08,111
Water.

5
00:00:08,113 --> 00:00:12,132
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:12,134 --> 00:00:14,217
and bring balance to the world.

7

8
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:21,975
Korra has regained her memory!

9
00:00:21,977 --> 00:00:24,293
By connecting
with the original Avatar,

10
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:25,929
Korra learned
that to stop Unalaq

11
00:00:25,931 --> 00:00:28,965
she must close the spirit portal
before harmonic convergence,

12
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:30,633
which is only weeks away!

13
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:33,403
Meanwhile, Varrick
has made Bolin into a mover star

14
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:35,105
and saved Asami's company.

15
00:00:35,107 --> 00:00:36,272
Mako is the only one

16
00:00:36,274 --> 00:00:38,024
who suspects
that Varrick is up to no good,

17
00:00:38,026 --> 00:00:39,692
but can he prove it?

18
00:00:49,453 --> 00:00:51,538
Gotcha!

19
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,922
Furry-foot, come back.

20
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:01,214
Jinora, there you are.

21
00:01:01,216 --> 00:01:03,633
Come on, everyone's waiting.

22
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:05,501
Were you playing with someone?

23
00:01:05,503 --> 00:01:08,521
Oh, just some
imaginary friends.

24
00:01:14,945 --> 00:01:16,479
Stop telling lies.

25
00:01:16,481 --> 00:01:17,847
It's true!

26
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:20,567
I once beat an earthbender
in a rock-throwing contest!

27
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:22,569
I have the trophy to prove it.

28
00:01:22,571 --> 00:01:24,704
All right, who's ready
for an exciting tour

29
00:01:24,706 --> 00:01:26,239
of the eastern air temple?

30
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:27,790
We've got a lot to see today

31
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:31,044
including ancient statues,
ancient gardens,

32
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:34,714
and the meditation hall
used by ancient airbenders.

33
00:01:34,716 --> 00:01:35,748
Yay.

34
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,000
Old things.

35
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:42,839
Korra?

36
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:43,873
Korra!

37
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,225
Yay, Korra.

38
00:01:45,227 --> 00:01:46,226
Korra's back.

39
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:47,427
What are you doing here?

40
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:49,179
And how did you know
where to find us?

41
00:01:49,181 --> 00:01:50,680
Tenzin's itinerary.

42
00:01:50,682 --> 00:01:52,098
We went over it
like a hundred times

43
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,650
before we left Republic City.

44
00:01:53,652 --> 00:01:54,651
See?

45
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:56,886
This is why
schedules are important.

46
00:01:56,888 --> 00:01:59,555
It's so great
to see you all again.

47
00:01:59,557 --> 00:02:01,741
It's great to see you too,

48
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:03,576
but why aren't you training
at the South pole?

49
00:02:03,578 --> 00:02:06,079
Wait, you don't know
about the civil war?

50
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:07,080
What?

51
00:02:07,082 --> 00:02:08,331
No.

52
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,116
We've been out of touch
with the outside world

53
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:11,334
since we started our vacation.

54
00:02:11,336 --> 00:02:12,619
Tenzin's idea.

55
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:13,953
What happened?

56
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:15,121
So much.

57
00:02:15,123 --> 00:02:16,739
I don't know where to start.

58
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:17,957
Just tell us everything!

59
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:19,626
Everything?

60
00:02:19,628 --> 00:02:21,410
Okay.

61
00:02:21,412 --> 00:02:23,296
I opened a spirit portal
at the South pole,

62
00:02:23,298 --> 00:02:25,181
but then Unalaq
turned out to be a bad guy

63
00:02:25,183 --> 00:02:26,749
and wanted to take control
of the South,

64
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:28,268
so I sort of started
a civil war,

65
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,719
but when I went to
find some help,

66
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:31,137
I was attacked by my cousins

67
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:32,605
and then by
a giant, dark spirit,

68
00:02:32,607 --> 00:02:34,057
and then I forgot who I was,

69
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:35,358
and then I met the first Avatar,

70
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,726
and then I realized

71
00:02:36,728 --> 00:02:38,528
I shouldn't have opened
the portal in the first place,

72
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,810
and now I need to
close it again!

73
00:02:41,282 --> 00:02:42,865
I knew this would happen.

74
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:49,706
So Avatar wan imprisoned
this dark spirit Vaatu

75
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,274
in the spirit world?

76
00:02:51,276 --> 00:02:54,244
Yes, and now I think my Uncle
is trying to free him.

77
00:02:54,246 --> 00:02:56,296
I knew Unalaq
was hungry for power

78
00:02:56,298 --> 00:02:58,915
but never realized
how far he would go to get it.

79
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:00,333
This is all my fault.

80
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:02,118
No, don't blame yourself.

81
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,803
This is Unalaq's doing.

82
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:05,755
Now, we must focus
on setting things right

83
00:03:05,757 --> 00:03:07,757
before he can do
any more damage.

84
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,925
Thank you.

85
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:12,979
So you need to close
the Southern portal,

86
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:15,265
but if Unalaq's army
controls the South,

87
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:16,399
how are we going to get to it?

88
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:18,067
I thought about that.

89
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:21,070
My best chance to close
the portal is from the inside.

90
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:23,606
I have to enter
the spirit world.

91
00:03:23,608 --> 00:03:25,825
A journey to the spirit world.

92
00:03:25,827 --> 00:03:28,144
All my years
of spiritual training

93
00:03:28,146 --> 00:03:30,747
have prepared me
for this moment.

94
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:31,998
I will help you.

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,535
Today, we enter
the spirit world.

96
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:40,489
Father, what are we doing here?

97
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:42,925
You're here to straighten out
the mess you caused

98
00:03:42,927 --> 00:03:45,161
when you failed
to capture the Avatar.

99
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:47,496
I told you,
it wasn't our fault.

100
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:48,598
You're right.

101
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,833
It was my fault
for trusting you.

102
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:53,269
Harmonic convergence
is almost upon us.

103
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:56,189
This is my opportunity
to change the world.

104
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:58,841
We'll make it up to you,
father.

105
00:03:58,843 --> 00:04:01,060
Good,
because I'll need your help

106
00:04:01,062 --> 00:04:03,512
to open the northern portal.

107
00:04:03,514 --> 00:04:05,681
I thought only
the Avatar could do it.

108
00:04:05,683 --> 00:04:08,117
I believe there is another way.

109
00:04:15,692 --> 00:04:17,627
This way.

110
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:22,715
There it is:

111
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:24,717
The northern portal.

112
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:37,980
Cut!

113
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:39,932
Okay, that's lunch, everyone.

114
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:45,271
Hello?
Anyone?

115
00:04:45,273 --> 00:04:48,274
Nuktuk's still up here,
all alone.

116
00:04:50,995 --> 00:04:51,994
Asami!

117
00:04:51,996 --> 00:04:53,396
Hey, what are you doing here?

118
00:04:53,398 --> 00:04:55,898
Varrick invited me
to watch some of the filming.

119
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,501
Are you filming right now?

120
00:04:58,503 --> 00:04:59,502
Right now?
Nope.

121
00:04:59,504 --> 00:05:00,503
We're, uh...

122
00:05:00,505 --> 00:05:01,704
We're at lunch.

123
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:03,589
Asami, there you are.

124
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:04,590
Is Bolin around?

125
00:05:04,592 --> 00:05:05,591
Up here.

126
00:05:05,593 --> 00:05:06,742
Good.

127
00:05:06,744 --> 00:05:07,960
I've got something
to tell you both.

128
00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:11,013
Ow.

129
00:05:11,015 --> 00:05:13,099
I got to stop doing
my own stunts.

130
00:05:13,101 --> 00:05:16,436
I found out who's been
stealing from future industries:

131
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:18,054
Varrick.

132
00:05:18,056 --> 00:05:19,055
What?

133
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:20,056
No.

134
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:21,524
He attacked his own ship?

135
00:05:21,526 --> 00:05:22,525
Yes!

136
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:23,976
It was a ploy.

137
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:25,812
He wants Republic City
to go to war,

138
00:05:25,814 --> 00:05:27,363
and he wants control
of the businesses

139
00:05:27,365 --> 00:05:29,265
that stand to profit
the most from it.

140
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:30,700
He already had all the shipping.

141
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:32,869
All he needed
was future industries.

142
00:05:32,871 --> 00:05:35,705
Varrick helped save
Future Industries.

143
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:38,791
He's my business partner now,
not an evil mastermind.

144
00:05:38,793 --> 00:05:41,244
Mako, you seem stressed.

145
00:05:41,246 --> 00:05:42,778
I am stressed!

146
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,664
See, this is why
I had to move out.

147
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,549
You guys aren't
living together anymore?

148
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:47,550
Nope.

149
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:48,918
It was time for this eagle-hawk

150
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,255
to spread his wings and fly.

151
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:54,757
Sounds like you've had
a pretty busy week.

152
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,676
Maybe you just need to relax.

153
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:01,464
Wait a minute.

154
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:03,683
Are you two...

155
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:04,767
you're dating again!

156
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:05,768
What?

157
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,769
Dating?
No!

158
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:07,770
That's crazy!

159
00:06:07,772 --> 00:06:09,906
Korra just left a week ago!

160
00:06:09,908 --> 00:06:12,325
Guys, listen to me.

161
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:14,977
Varrick is up to no good,
and I have proof.

162
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:16,913
The detonators
he uses in his movers

163
00:06:16,915 --> 00:06:18,414
are exactly like
the one I found

164
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,815
at the cultural center attack.

165
00:06:19,817 --> 00:06:22,151
And those explosions
were exactly like the ones

166
00:06:22,153 --> 00:06:25,087
the Captain reported when
Asami's shipment was hijacked.

167
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:26,172
Don't you see?

168
00:06:26,174 --> 00:06:27,707
Anyone could have
gotten their hands

169
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:28,925
on one of those detonators.

170
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:29,926
Yeah.

171
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:30,927
Let it go, Mako.

172
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:32,462
Let it go.

173
00:06:32,464 --> 00:06:33,463
No!

174
00:06:33,465 --> 00:06:34,964
I'm not going to let it go!

175
00:06:40,337 --> 00:06:42,104
Varrick's been looking for you.

176
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:47,026
You're lucky.

177
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:48,945
This temple
is the most spiritual

178
00:06:48,947 --> 00:06:50,813
of all the air temples.

179
00:06:50,815 --> 00:06:54,617
Why, this very garden is where
my father met Guru Pathik.

180
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:55,868
Wow!

181
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,487
Spirit world, here we come.

182
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:17,706
Are you in the spirit world?

183
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:21,477
I would be
if Meelo could ring his bell

184
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,312
at the appropriate intervals.

185
00:07:23,314 --> 00:07:26,232
Aww, did I do it wrong?

186
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:29,101
Let's try something else.

187
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:31,354
I thought your bell ringing
was just fine.

188
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:32,939
Thanks!

189
00:07:47,505 --> 00:07:50,206
Kya, this is too much smoke.

190
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,374
You set it up wrong.

191
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:52,575
This isn't going to work.

192
00:07:52,577 --> 00:07:53,576
I'm sorry.

193
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:54,677
I did what you told me.

194
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:56,078
Well, the moment's ruined.

195
00:08:01,018 --> 00:08:02,718
We could have tried
a little longer.

196
00:08:13,264 --> 00:08:15,231
Come back, furry-foot!

197
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:18,484
Hey, Jinora,
what are you chasing?

198
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:19,435
Nothing.

199
00:08:27,077 --> 00:08:28,611
Focus, Korra.

200
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:30,997
Focus.

201
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:32,548
I am focusing.

202
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,833
No talking.

203
00:08:33,835 --> 00:08:36,335
Feel the energy of the universe.

204
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:38,287
Okay, I feel it.

205
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,388
Korra, really!

206
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,173
I'm trying to concentrate here!

207
00:08:41,175 --> 00:08:43,259
I don't think this location
is going to work either.

208
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:44,960
What's going on with you?

209
00:08:44,962 --> 00:08:47,396
First, you're blaming Meelo,
then Kya, and now me.

210
00:08:47,398 --> 00:08:49,482
Well, nothing is
feeling right to me.

211
00:08:49,484 --> 00:08:51,067
I don't want to
rush your feelings,

212
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:52,635
but we're kind of in a hurry.

213
00:08:52,637 --> 00:08:54,487
How did you first get into
the spirit world?

214
00:08:54,489 --> 00:08:55,605
Let's try that.

215
00:08:56,657 --> 00:08:57,990
Well...

216
00:08:57,992 --> 00:09:01,611
Actually, I've never been
into the spirit world.

217
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:09,137
You've never been
into the spirit world?

218
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:12,757
But you used to spend days
in the temple meditating.

219
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,809
Trying to get in.

220
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:16,043
It never happened.

221
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:18,646
It's my greatest shortcoming
as an airbender,

222
00:09:18,648 --> 00:09:21,733
spiritual leader,
and son of Aang.

223
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:25,937
Welcome to
the "I disappoint dad" club.

224
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:27,739
If you've never been
to the spirit world,

225
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:29,741
how were you planning
to get Korra into it?

226
00:09:29,743 --> 00:09:32,360
I've spent years studying
the techniques and theories

227
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:34,328
of ancient spiritual leaders.

228
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,732
Now that the Avatar needs me,
it must be my time.

229
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:40,284
Tenzin, harmonic convergence
is almost here.

230
00:09:40,286 --> 00:09:42,036
If Vaatu escapes
from the spirit world...

231
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:43,705
you have to trust me.

232
00:09:43,707 --> 00:09:46,240
I can help you.

233
00:09:46,242 --> 00:09:48,259
There might be another way.

234
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:51,012
Jinora, is there something
you want to tell Korra?

235
00:09:51,014 --> 00:09:52,463
Jinora?

236
00:09:52,465 --> 00:09:54,048
She is too young and untrained

237
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,250
to have any knowledge
about spiritual matters.

238
00:09:56,252 --> 00:09:59,937
Actually, I think I do know
where Korra needs to go

239
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:01,522
to get into the spirit world.

240
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:03,307
And how would you know that?

241
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:05,810
My spirit friends showed me.

242
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:06,861
It's okay.

243
00:10:06,863 --> 00:10:08,146
You can show yourselves.

244
00:10:14,037 --> 00:10:15,653
How did you do that?

245
00:10:15,655 --> 00:10:16,904
Jinora.

246
00:10:16,906 --> 00:10:18,489
Bunnies!

247
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:20,941
Actually, they're
dragonfly-bunny spirits.

248
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:21,959
I knew it.

249
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:23,377
Looks like
she does know something

250
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:24,779
about spiritual matters.

251
00:10:28,752 --> 00:10:31,135
- So cute.
- Bunnies!

252
00:10:31,137 --> 00:10:33,671
Come back!

253
00:10:33,673 --> 00:10:35,890
How long have you been able
to do this?

254
00:10:35,892 --> 00:10:37,391
I don't know.

255
00:10:37,393 --> 00:10:39,960
I guess I've always kind of
had a connection with spirits.

256
00:10:41,648 --> 00:10:43,731
I think this one likes me.

257
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:45,650
Are they here to help?

258
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:47,802
I think they want you
to go down there.

259
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:49,020
I don't know.

260
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:51,572
The spiritual energy
is historically strongest

261
00:10:51,574 --> 00:10:52,857
near the temple.

262
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:54,525
No offense,
but I'm guessing the spirits

263
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:56,327
have actually been
to the spirit world,

264
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:57,812
so I'm gonna follow them.

265
00:10:57,814 --> 00:10:59,781
If we need to go
to the Tenzin world,

266
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:00,832
we'll call you.

267
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,839
Father, haven't the spirits
had 10,000 years

268
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:09,123
to open this portal?

269
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,291
If they could not succeed,

270
00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:11,592
what makes you think we will?

271
00:11:11,594 --> 00:11:14,595
By entering the spirit world
through the portal,

272
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:17,298
we bring with us
something the spirits never had:

273
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,716
Our bending.

274
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:28,109
Join me!

275
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:29,644
Together we can
open this portal.

276
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:45,877
Desna!

277
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:46,878
Leave him.

278
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,547
Keep bending!

279
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:51,966
He needs a healer at once!

280
00:11:51,968 --> 00:11:53,551
This is more important!

281
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:03,210
I'm taking him back.

282
00:12:28,453 --> 00:12:30,588
I hear you've got some ideas.

283
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,340
You wanna tell me about them?

284
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:35,459
Go ahead.

285
00:12:35,461 --> 00:12:36,878
Torture me all you want.

286
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,879
I'm not gonna talk.

287
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:39,297
Torture?

288
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:43,384
The only thing I want to torture
is this pesky foot fungus.

289
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:44,385
Ooh!

290
00:12:44,387 --> 00:12:45,386
Ah!

291
00:12:45,388 --> 00:12:46,387
Eee!

292
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:47,388
Ooh!

293
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:49,681
The burning means it's working.

294
00:12:51,944 --> 00:12:53,527
I heard you've been
investigating

295
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:55,980
the recent attacks on my ships,

296
00:12:55,982 --> 00:13:00,618
and I think you know that I know
that you know, you know?

297
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,102
Know what?

298
00:13:02,104 --> 00:13:05,289
That the world
is a dangerous place,

299
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,608
and that's exactly why
I want to offer you

300
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,794
a job on my security force.

301
00:13:09,796 --> 00:13:11,278
I have a job.

302
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,964
We need you.

303
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:14,498
Me, asami, Bolin.

304
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,133
We're all on the same team here.

305
00:13:16,135 --> 00:13:17,969
We want you to join us.

306
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:20,838
You wouldn't want anything
to happen to asami, would you?

307
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,342
I mean, I heard you and her
were kind of an item again.

308
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:25,509
Or what about your brother?

309
00:13:25,511 --> 00:13:26,844
What are you saying?

310
00:13:26,846 --> 00:13:31,232
I'm saying I want your help
to protect them.

311
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:32,483
Without you,

312
00:13:32,485 --> 00:13:34,268
who knows what could happen.

313
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,104
Thanks for your concern,

314
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:38,689
but the answer is no.

315
00:13:48,484 --> 00:13:51,118
Oh, you are just so cute.

316
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,987
I'm going to name you Bum-Ju.

317
00:13:52,989 --> 00:13:54,839
It's short for "Bumi, Junior."

318
00:13:54,841 --> 00:13:57,491
Don't you think
he looks like me?

319
00:13:57,493 --> 00:13:59,844
The resemblance is uncanny.

320
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:02,096
I think dad's mad at me.

321
00:14:02,098 --> 00:14:03,881
Your father's not mad.

322
00:14:03,883 --> 00:14:05,516
His pride's
just a little bruised

323
00:14:05,518 --> 00:14:07,969
since he isn't able
to see spirits like you.

324
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:09,670
You have a natural gift.

325
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:11,138
That's pretty lucky.

326
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,723
You're the lucky one.

327
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:15,192
You actually got to meet
the first Avatar.

328
00:14:15,194 --> 00:14:16,727
I know about a lot of Avatars,

329
00:14:16,729 --> 00:14:18,612
but I don't know anything
about him.

330
00:14:18,614 --> 00:14:19,981
Is it even a him,

331
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:21,181
or is it a her?

332
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,118
It's a him, Avatar wan.

333
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,987
He was amazing.

334
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:28,188
I saw how he became
the first Avatar

335
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,958
by fusing with Raava,
the spirit of light.

336
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,494
The Avatar is part spirit?

337
00:14:33,496 --> 00:14:34,712
Of course!

338
00:14:34,714 --> 00:14:36,363
Just like the statue!

339
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:37,548
What statue?

340
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,583
When we were
at the Southern air temple,

341
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:41,752
I was drawn to this old carving.

342
00:14:41,754 --> 00:14:44,171
I couldn't figure out
what it was until now.

343
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:46,057
It was the first Avatar.

344
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:47,425
When did this happen?

345
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:48,843
It was on the solstice.

346
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:51,679
That's the day
I opened the Southern portal.

347
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:52,680
Whoa.

348
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:54,849
We're here!

349
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,770
Are you sure these spirits

350
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:01,489
are leading us
to the right place?

351
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:02,556
Of course!

352
00:15:02,558 --> 00:15:04,692
I trust Bum-Ju with my life.

353
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,201
Look.

354
00:15:14,203 --> 00:15:16,337
There are carvings on them.

355
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:20,841
This is an ancient airbender
meditation circle.

356
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:26,797
There's a lot of
spiritual energy in this place,

357
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,433
but it feels really strange.

358
00:15:29,435 --> 00:15:32,219
We'll have to perform
a spiritual cleansing ceremony.

359
00:15:32,221 --> 00:15:33,554
What are you talking about?

360
00:15:33,556 --> 00:15:34,772
Dad taught it to me.

361
00:15:34,774 --> 00:15:37,274
This site has been neglected
for many years.

362
00:15:37,276 --> 00:15:39,944
A cleansing ceremony will help
strengthen its connection

363
00:15:39,946 --> 00:15:41,278
to the spirit world.

364
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,912
Good job, you cleansed the area

365
00:15:57,914 --> 00:15:59,914
of the only spirits
that want to help us,

366
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,715
and you scared away Bum-Ju.

367
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,623
It's working.

368
00:16:17,432 --> 00:16:18,432
Boom!

369
00:16:33,152 --> 00:16:34,869
Ah!
Bats!

370
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:36,437
Evil bats!

371
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:37,872
Not bats.

372
00:16:37,874 --> 00:16:38,790
Dark spirits!

373
00:16:50,252 --> 00:16:51,469
What are we supposed to do?

374
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:24,669
Amazing.

375
00:17:42,054 --> 00:17:44,806
Your spiritual training
has come a long way.

376
00:17:44,808 --> 00:17:46,474
Unalaq may be
a horrible person,

377
00:17:46,476 --> 00:17:48,526
but his spirit powers
are no joke.

378
00:17:48,528 --> 00:17:51,896
He taught you how to
transform dark spirits.

379
00:17:51,898 --> 00:17:54,148
I can't even get you
into the spirit world.

380
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,402
Everything Unalaq taught me
was to help himself.

381
00:17:57,404 --> 00:17:59,654
Everything you've done
was meant to help me.

382
00:17:59,656 --> 00:18:04,542
I am so sorry for turning
my back on you as my mentor.

383
00:18:04,544 --> 00:18:06,411
I need you now more than ever.

384
00:18:07,496 --> 00:18:09,047
I won't let you down.

385
00:18:18,373 --> 00:18:20,842
The ancient airbenders
must have built this site.

386
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:24,062
If we meditate here,

387
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:26,647
we'll be able
to enter the spirit world.

388
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:29,216
Why don't you go first?

389
00:18:29,218 --> 00:18:31,052
After all these years,

390
00:18:31,054 --> 00:18:34,405
my father's dream for me
will finally come true.

391
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:43,564
Hi.

392
00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:44,782
Did you come by to tell me

393
00:18:44,784 --> 00:18:46,167
how paranoid I am?

394
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:47,452
No.

395
00:18:47,454 --> 00:18:49,370
I just wanted to come by
to make sure you're okay.

396
00:18:49,372 --> 00:18:50,922
You seemed so agitated earlier.

397
00:18:50,924 --> 00:18:52,239
I'm fine.

398
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:53,841
Maybe you need a night off.

399
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:55,376
Why don't we go get some dinner?

400
00:18:55,378 --> 00:18:57,045
No, thanks.

401
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:58,079
I'm a little busy.

402
00:18:58,081 --> 00:19:00,298
Too busy for Kwong's cuisine?

403
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,466
Remember?

404
00:19:01,468 --> 00:19:03,134
We had our first date there.

405
00:19:03,136 --> 00:19:05,086
Maybe I do need to
get my mind off things.

406
00:19:07,974 --> 00:19:08,923
Police!

407
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:12,193
Hey, Mako.

408
00:19:12,195 --> 00:19:14,095
Hope we didn't interrupt
you two lovebirds.

409
00:19:15,397 --> 00:19:16,481
What's going on?

410
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:17,932
We busted some triple threats

411
00:19:17,934 --> 00:19:19,367
who said you hired them
for a job.

412
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,070
All right.

413
00:19:22,072 --> 00:19:23,404
It's true.

414
00:19:23,406 --> 00:19:25,907
We were trying to figure out
who stole Asami's stuff,

415
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:28,709
so we hired them
for a sting operation.

416
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:30,411
I'm sorry for
going behind your back.

417
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:33,748
According to
the triple threats,

418
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,916
you did more than that.

419
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:36,167
They said you helped them steal

420
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:38,119
a warehouse full of
future industries property.

421
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:39,453
That's crazy!

422
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:41,305
You're gonna believe
a bunch of criminals?

423
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:43,057
I have to follow up on a lead.

424
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,628
Well, looky what I found:

425
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,230
Cash...

426
00:19:49,232 --> 00:19:50,431
And these.

427
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,734
What are you doing
with explosives, Mako?

428
00:19:53,736 --> 00:19:55,520
I don't know
where those came from.

429
00:19:55,522 --> 00:19:57,155
You're under arrest.

430
00:19:57,157 --> 00:19:59,107
None of that is mine.

431
00:19:59,109 --> 00:20:01,809
Should've known you'd hook up
with your old pals.

432
00:20:01,811 --> 00:20:04,996
Once a triple threat,
always a triple threat.

433
00:20:04,998 --> 00:20:06,814
This has to be a mistake.

434
00:20:06,816 --> 00:20:08,666
Sorry to break the news
to you, sweetie,

435
00:20:08,668 --> 00:20:11,202
but your boyfriend's
just a crooked cop.

436
00:20:11,204 --> 00:20:13,704
That sting operation
was just a way

437
00:20:13,706 --> 00:20:15,489
to lure you away
from your warehouse.

438
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:19,493
He was using you
the whole time.

439
00:20:19,495 --> 00:20:20,678
That's not true, asami.

440
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,997
I would never do anything
to hurt you.

441
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:23,998
It's Varrick.

442
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,183
This is all Varrick.

443
00:20:25,185 --> 00:20:26,801
He set me up!

444
00:20:26,803 --> 00:20:29,270
Yeah, it's Varrick's fault.

445
00:20:29,272 --> 00:20:30,605
Varrick.

446
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:33,024
Varrick.

447
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,517
You in the spirit world yet?

448
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,369
No, I am not,

449
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:47,354
and stop bugging me.

450
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,575
It's okay, Tenzin.

451
00:20:50,577 --> 00:20:52,326
Maybe you weren't meant to
guide Korra

452
00:20:52,328 --> 00:20:53,661
into the spirit world.

453
00:20:53,663 --> 00:20:55,129
No!
Just give me some time.

454
00:20:55,131 --> 00:20:57,498
Stop being so stubborn.

455
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,200
It's not your destiny.

456
00:20:59,202 --> 00:21:01,802
I think Jinora was meant to
guide the Avatar.

457
00:21:01,804 --> 00:21:04,338
Jinora will not enter
the spirit world!

458
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,807
She's not ready for the dangers
of the other side,

459
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:08,476
but I am.

460
00:21:08,478 --> 00:21:10,311
I've spent years training,
studying,

461
00:21:10,313 --> 00:21:12,096
and mastering
everything there is to know

462
00:21:12,098 --> 00:21:13,181
about the spirit world.

463
00:21:13,183 --> 00:21:15,049
Tenzin, we're running
out of time.

464
00:21:15,051 --> 00:21:16,717
If everyone could just be quiet

465
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:18,052
and let me focus.

466
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:20,888
Aunt Kya is right.

467
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,724
I can guide Korra
into the spirit world.

468
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:24,992
I'll be all right.

469
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:34,085
Perhaps I will never have
the connection with spirits

470
00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:35,920
like I always wanted...

471
00:21:35,922 --> 00:21:39,207
Like my father
wanted me to have.

472
00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:41,209
It's okay, daddy.

473
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:43,427
I'm proud of you.

474
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:44,428
Go.

475
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,713
Close the portal.

476
00:21:45,715 --> 00:21:47,381
We'll wait here
and keep your bodies safe

477
00:21:47,383 --> 00:21:48,883
till you return.

478
00:21:48,885 --> 00:21:50,184
We'll be all right.

479
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:20,998
The spirit world.

480
00:22:23,118 --> 00:22:25,219
The Avatar is dead,

481
00:22:25,221 --> 00:22:27,888
and we cannot open
the northern portal.

482
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,957
I have failed you, Vaatu.

483
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:32,927
You have not failed me...

484
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:34,228
Yet.

485
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:37,965
The Avatar still lives.

486
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:39,600
How do you know?

487
00:22:39,602 --> 00:22:44,459
Even though my connection
to Raava was severed,

488
00:22:44,504 --> 00:22:47,622
I can still feel her
presence.

489
00:22:47,649 --> 00:22:51,466
- I'll find her.
- The Avatar will find you.

490
00:22:52,668 --> 00:22:56,291
She has just entered the
spirit world.

491
