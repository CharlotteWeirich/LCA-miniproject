1
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,385
You're
taking a vacation from normalcy.

2
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,487
A weird, motel

3
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:23,389
where the bed is stained
with mystery,

4
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,058
and there's also some mystery
floating in the pool.

5
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,861
Your key card may not open
the exercise room

6
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,830
because someone smeared mystery
on the lock.

7
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:33,432
But it will open...
The scary door.

8
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,403
Submitted for your Emmy

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,305
A popular senator
with unpopular ideas.

10
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,641
There is no such thing
as space aliens!

11
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,176
Oh?

12
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,944
How can you be so sure

13
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,247
them aliens ain't
already among us?

14
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,349
I'll tell you how.

15
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,718
Because you are one!

16
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,325
Hey, I was watching that!

17
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,661
The saints just needed
a field goal to tie!

18
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,797
Lrrr, you lazy ruler

19
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,799
of the planet Omicron Persei 8!

20
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,867
You said you would
conquer a planet today,

21
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,403
but you have not even
shed your skin yet!

22
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,907
Yes, NDND, I heard you
the first hundred times.

23
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,509
I'll conquer something
tomorrow after I fuel up

24
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,912
on one of your disgusting
egg-white omelets!

25
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,648
You want yolks? Fine.

26
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:26,085
Enjoy your stroke.

27
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:34,626
Ha-ha-ha! I am conquering earth.

28
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,296
Not so fast, invader x!

29
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:40,299
Here comes delivery-boy man!

30
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:45,671
Laser eye power!

31
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:48,841
Hand magnet power!

32
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:54,179
Yay, I'm unbuckled!

33
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,582
Stop it, you hero!

34
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:57,950
Reverse time power!

35
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,321
It's earlier now.

36
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,389
Mmm...

37
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,825
Mmm...

38
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,994
So what do you think
of my comic?

39
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,630
After I leave here,

40
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,398
I'm getting a memory enema.

41
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,567
If I might offer some
constructive criticism...

42
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,402
There was never any real peril.

43
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,539
I mean, the delivery guy has,
like, 30 super powers.

44
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:21,874
Well, that's because
he was bitten

45
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,675
by a radioactive superman!

46
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,844
This is wonderful!

47
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,379
It is, isn't it?

48
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,314
Wait, those are the ads.

49
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,550
These X-ray specs will

50
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,485
really take the guesswork out
of surgery.

51
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,421
No more chopping
blindly in the goop.

52
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,890
Don't waste your
allowance, Zoidberg.

53
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,192
This stuff is
butt-grade crap.

54
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,295
Amuse your friends
with real vomit.

55
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,496
Throw your voice.

56
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,731
Sea monkeys.

57
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,633
Throw your sea monkeys.

58
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,568
My disintegrator ray
really works.

59
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:50,969
But that's you.

60
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,804
That's how I know it's bunkum.

61
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,240
The Farnsworth novelty
disintegrator ray is

62
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,843
nothing more than a
common teleporter ray.

63
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,883
Pfft! Worthless toy!

64
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,919
I'm sick of being critiqued
by nitpicking nerds.

65
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,321
I'm taking this
to a comic book convention!

66
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,730
Shmeesh, it's crowded.

67
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,700
Good thing everyone is
freshly bathed and groomed.

68
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,535
Ooh!

69
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,271
What are you doing?!

70
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,472
That's the rare Zapp Brannigan

71
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,308
with recording session blooper!

72
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,443
don't
tell me how to do the line.

73
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,011
It sickens me.

74
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,381
But the sign said there was
a mint in the box.

75
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,122
Thank you. Okay, thanks, thanks.
Settle, settle down!

76
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,958
So anyway, we're really excited

77
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,293
to show you guys the pilot
for our new series.

78
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:52,364
It's set in the year 4000,
and we call it Futurella!

79
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,909
Wow.

80
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,178
Fox has really streamlined
the process.

81
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,579
Matt will now take questions.

82
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:08,880
But please,
only about Futurella,

83
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,549
not the Simpsons.

84
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,785
Yes? The robot standing on
the small child over there?

85
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,821
Ooh! Ooh!
Yeah, uh, when are you going

86
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,789
to make a second Simpsons movie?

87
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,725
Oh!

88
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,464
Mr. Aragonés, I'm a big
fan of your cartoons

89
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:26,732
and your moustache.

90
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,433
You want it? Take it!

91
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,168
It's brought me nothing
but misery.

92
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:31,837
Wow, thanks.

93
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,305
Ay-yi-yi!

94
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,940
If you could just quiet down,

95
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,942
I wanted to get your opinion
of my comic book.

96
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,412
Señor, anyone who still writes
comics is a hero to me.

97
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,615
Mmm, it stinks.

98
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,787
But, um, I do like the tiny
doodles in the margins.

99
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,456
That's just some relish
from a hot dog I found.

100
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,725
Attention, lady and gentlemen,

101
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,461
the costume contest
is about to begin.

102
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,629
The costume contest.

103
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,132
The costume contest...!

104
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,509
What the hell are you
supposed to be?

105
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:13,312
Every nerd's fantasy, baby.

106
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,148
Next up, contestant number 36!

107
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,624
Contestant 36, everyone!

108
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,693
Next up, contestant 37.

109
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,003
I am Lrrr,
ruler of the planet...

110
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,205
Hold on a second,
let me just get this.

111
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,608
I am Lrrr,

112
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,611
ruler of the planet Omicron
Persei 8.

113
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,513
You are hereby conquered!

114
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,215
Please line up in order

115
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,284
of how much beryllium it takes
to kill you!

116
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,125
Damn, that's a good costume.

117
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,328
Next up, contestant 38!

118
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,697
I don't understand.

119
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,599
Why are the humans still
eating their soft pretzels

120
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,301
instead of surrendering?

121
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,203
They're probably just waiting
for Joss Whedon.

122
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,604
Joss Whedon's here?!

123
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,140
Wait a minute.
You look familiar.

124
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,842
Yeah, you almost ate me once.

125
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,144
I was in your mouth
for five minutes.

126
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,278
Leela?

127
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,446
And the winner is...

128
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,614
Nerdgasma!

129
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,418
Whoo!
I got fruit boobs!

130
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,421
What's the use?

131
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,330
Now what?

132
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,265
I send you out to
conquer a planet,

133
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,934
and all you bring back
is J.J. Abrams' face?

134
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,803
I thought you'd like it.

135
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,405
You haven't even tried it on!

136
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:47,906
I might dress up in a face

137
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,708
if you ever took me
anywhere nice!

138
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,343
Oh, boy, here we go.

139
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,579
I built this castle
with my own two slaves!

140
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,715
What are you gonna do,
kick me out?

141
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:06,758
I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet
Omicron Persei 8!

142
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,527
May I crash on your couch?

143
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:15,233
So he just showed up
unannounced,

144
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,801
raided the liquor cabinet,

145
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:20,171
sprayed urine on the ceiling,
and passed out?

146
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,606
And the walls.

147
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,008
Yeah, leave me alone!

148
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:27,679
My wife hates me and planetary
conquest has become a chore.

149
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:29,047
There, there.

150
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,983
You're just having
a midlife crisis.

151
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,918
Midlife crisis, eh?

152
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:37,856
Lrrr demands the comfort of
pop-psychological platitudes!

153
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:40,125
Look, Hoss,
your wife threw you out.

154
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:41,893
That's your license
to be a jerk.

155
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,194
Do whatever the hell you want,

156
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:46,197
then walk away
and light a cigar.

157
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,899
Don't listen to him, Lrrr.

158
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,300
Bender may seem happy...

159
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,271
But long-term,

160
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,341
you need to reinvest in
your relationship with NDND.

161
00:07:56,408 --> 00:08:00,111
Yes, it's clear what I must do.

162
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,928
I like it.

163
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,099
I'm thinking we need

164
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:25,170
to downplay those
hideous growths on your head.

165
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:26,938
Horns are a sign of virility.

166
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,206
Also, they house my testes.

167
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:32,143
I'm thinking horn extensions.

168
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:38,115
You need some arm candy.

169
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:39,717
It's the perfect accessory

170
00:08:39,784 --> 00:08:41,885
for out-of-shape middle-aged
creeps like you.

171
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:43,487
Yeah, I said it!

172
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:45,356
What's your type, Borgnine?

173
00:08:45,423 --> 00:08:47,624
Big and angry.

174
00:08:52,964 --> 00:08:55,599
Look, Brah,
you're just not gonna find

175
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:58,035
a lot of hot, gigantic
Omicronian babes

176
00:08:58,103 --> 00:08:59,470
in this solar system.

177
00:08:59,537 --> 00:09:00,604
There's one!

178
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:05,876
Hey, cool cape.

179
00:09:05,944 --> 00:09:07,344
Where'd you get that?

180
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:08,746
What, this old thing?

181
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:10,581
Ah, I murdered my father.

182
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:14,051
My name's Lrrr, ruler
of the planet Omicron Persei 8.

183
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:15,686
I am called grrl.

184
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:18,489
Of the planet Omicron Persei 8?

185
00:09:18,556 --> 00:09:20,357
That is a pretty name!

186
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:25,496
What's on the TV tonight?

187
00:09:25,563 --> 00:09:28,532
Oh, wait, I don't care
'cause I got a date!

188
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,100
I know it's not what
you want to hear,

189
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:31,635
but I think this is a mistake.

190
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:33,170
Leela's right.

191
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:34,838
That's not what
you want to hear.

192
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:37,374
What you want to hear is
that I fixed my comic book!

193
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:38,876
Now the hero is more relatable

194
00:09:38,943 --> 00:09:40,511
because he has no ridiculous
powers.

195
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:42,780
Let's watch, shall we?

196
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:44,982
One more step

197
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,650
and little miss constructive
criticism here gets it!

198
00:09:46,718 --> 00:09:48,485
Oh, yeah?

199
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:51,088
I may be just a simple delivery
boy with no super powers,

200
00:09:51,156 --> 00:09:53,123
so there's nothing I can do.

201
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:55,993
Okay.

202
00:09:58,229 --> 00:10:00,898
So? Give me
your honest praise.

203
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:03,400
Fry, I've now seen
two comic books,

204
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:05,002
so listen to me.

205
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,439
Why should I care about the hero
when all he does is cry?

206
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:16,046
Mmm, that dinner
was a worthy foe.

207
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:20,084
Yes, we shall not see
its like again.

208
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:22,986
So, um...

209
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:25,556
Uh, uh...

210
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:29,059
Um, I'm sorry.

211
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:30,994
I-I haven't done this
for a while.

212
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:34,164
I just part-way out
of a bad relationship.

213
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:35,999
Maybe I should take this off.

214
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:43,140
You're a human?!

215
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,675
Only physically!

216
00:10:44,742 --> 00:10:46,276
I'm a cross-species dresser.

217
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:49,313
Wait. You're
an actual Omicronian?

218
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,981
Oh, God, oh, God,
what have I done?

219
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:53,050
This is so hot!

220
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:54,585
Conquer me, Lrrr!

221
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:57,654
Sharpen your horns on
my scaly thorax!

222
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:06,964
I want to go home,

223
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:09,566
but NDND would never
take me back now.

224
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:12,569
NDND just wants

225
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:14,705
To feel like you're listening
to her nagging.

226
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:17,274
Is there anything she's
been riding your ass about?

227
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:20,110
Mmm... conquering things,
I guess.

228
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:23,080
I could conquer earth,
kill all humans.

229
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:24,781
That's a thought.

230
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:27,184
No. We don't need
a war of the worlds.

231
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:29,586
That's it. We need a
war of the worlds.

232
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:31,655
I'll call Orson Welles.

233
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:34,658
Dork calling Orson.
Dork calling Orson.

234
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:39,029
You're asking me,

235
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:41,765
the renowned spokesman
for Paul Masson wine,

236
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:45,502
to recreate my brilliant
1938 radio broadcast

237
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,037
merely to deceive and impress

238
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:48,872
the wife of this
skinny reptile?

239
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,741
Sorry. Never mind.

240
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:51,975
I'll do it for free.

241
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:57,014
Ladies and gentlemen,
we interrupt our program

242
00:11:57,081 --> 00:11:58,782
of the Jonas brothers
and their orchestra

243
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,584
to bring you a special bulletin.

244
00:12:03,354 --> 00:12:06,123
We interrupt our program
of the Jonas brothers

245
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:09,626
and their orchestra
to bring you a special bulletin.

246
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:12,062
I'm speaking to you
from the hickory farms

247
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,664
in Grover's mall, new Jersey,

248
00:12:13,731 --> 00:12:15,532
through a mouthful
of summer sausage.

249
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,834
Mmm. Where I hardly know
where to begin.

250
00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:19,069
Mmm!

251
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:20,837
A huge spacecraft,

252
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,973
piloted by a devastatingly
handsome...

253
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,777
Now, how in God's name do I
know what the fellow looks like

254
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:28,979
if he's inside a ship
miles in the air?

255
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:30,614
It's just foolish on its face.

256
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:32,049
If you want
the cheese log,

257
00:12:32,116 --> 00:12:33,417
you'll read what I wrote.

258
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:35,686
Very well. I shall comply.

259
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:38,889
I'm getting reports that cities

260
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:42,059
across the globe are being
destroyed by this noble invader,

261
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:44,094
whose good looks
are apparently discernible

262
00:12:44,162 --> 00:12:47,364
across vast distances
and through solid metal.

263
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:49,066
But wait,
the leader of the attack

264
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:50,801
is swaggering out of his ship

265
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:53,937
and up to a convenient
nearby microphone.

266
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:55,739
Now, why couldn't I have just

267
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:57,307
described his appearance
at this point?

268
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,710
This is the type of thing
I'm talking about.

269
00:12:59,777 --> 00:13:04,147
People of earth, I am Lrrr,
conqueror of your planet.

270
00:13:04,215 --> 00:13:05,549
Cue screams.

271
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:09,486
You will now remove your skulls

272
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:12,089
and play dodgeball with them
for my amusement.

273
00:13:12,156 --> 00:13:15,959
Ooh... I could swear his horns
have gotten longer.

274
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:22,032
Sir, I've intercepted
an earth broadcast.

275
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,568
Put it up on the zenith.

276
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:28,238
Earth is conquered,

277
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:31,074
the destruction
of civilization complete.

278
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:34,611
Now stay tuned
for little orphan Annie.

279
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,413
To hell with
little orphan Annie!

280
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:38,515
We've got to do something.

281
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,750
What's that, honey?

282
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:41,084
How many dead?

283
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:43,620
Uh, I don't know.
Uh, 80 million?

284
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:46,089
Okay. I love you, too.

285
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:47,591
That was NDND.

286
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:48,825
She's taking me back!

287
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:52,629
I'm sorry I've been
so difficult.

288
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,543
So, you thought you could
conquer us so easily, eh?

289
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:07,744
Nice job.

290
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:09,713
We surrender.

291
00:14:09,781 --> 00:14:11,715
Earth is yours.

292
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:15,118
Damn, I'm good.

293
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:17,387
Now, may I please have
that cheese log?

294
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,226
Oh, glorious conqueror,

295
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,095
permit me to offer up
a sacrifice.

296
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,963
How about this?

297
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,266
Hey!

298
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,368
Yeah, he'll do.

299
00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:32,370
Come on, Lrrr.
Show's over.

300
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:33,804
Fine. Okay.

301
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,540
About this conquering thing...

302
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:37,308
Funny story...

303
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:46,050
Hello...

304
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,586
Lrrr.

305
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,122
Lrrr, put a stop
to this right now.

306
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,990
Okay. Okay. Quit nagging.

307
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,326
Lrrr, why are you
yelling softly

308
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,727
with the
purple-furred one?

309
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,930
Uh, it's nothing, my queen.

310
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:02,099
He messed up my hair.

311
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,801
I'm missing a leg.

312
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,269
We fought like hell, sir,

313
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,771
but in the end, we caved

314
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:08,806
like a house of soufflé cards.

315
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,775
Got it. Peace with honor.

316
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:12,076
Well, I resign again.

317
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,377
Come, Nixon.

318
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,479
Introduce me to
the kitchen staff.

319
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:19,517
I must lay down the law
about Lrrr's low-sodium diet.

320
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,252
You've got
to tell her the truth.

321
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,154
And lay off the salted peanuts.

322
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,856
I'm just trying to get the
leg taste out of my mouth.

323
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:30,127
Lrrr, I'm in here now,
not out there!

324
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:31,529
Give me a little time.

325
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,931
With a lady like NDND,
one must use finesse.

326
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,133
Uh, coming, gigantums.

327
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,998
Mmm. That's crisp.

328
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:09,300
Yes, but no more so than your

329
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,769
squamous dorsal plates
in the moonlight.

330
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,504
Ooh...

331
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,040
I am experiencing arousal.

332
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,708
My organs are moving
into position.

333
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:18,909
Ooh.

334
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,421
NDND, there's something
I've got to tell you.

335
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,757
What is it? Is
there someone else?

336
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:36,360
What? Oh, no, no, it's about
this takeover of earth.

337
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,162
It's, it's...

338
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,965
The spark that
reignited our marriage?

339
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,266
Yes, exactly.

340
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,001
Good night.

341
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,947
Oh, lord, now what?

342
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:59,150
I couldn't tell her the truth.

343
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:01,118
Look, you scaly crybaby,

344
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,387
you do what I say
and you do it now!

345
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,856
I knew it!

346
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:09,960
Frying pans,
cast-iron frying pans.

347
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,395
It's not what it looks like.

348
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:12,997
What do I do?

349
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,132
Do what I say.
Tell her!

350
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,300
Tell me what?

351
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,302
Give me the heavy one.

352
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:20,938
The invasion was all a fake.

353
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,940
I just wanted to impress you.

354
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,275
You lied?

355
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,243
What else have you
been hiding from me?

356
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,449
What else?
Nothing else.

357
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:32,416
I still want you, Lrrr,

358
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:35,427
ng to fight for you.

359
00:17:35,495 --> 00:17:38,397
All I got left is a
colander and a pie pan.

360
00:17:38,464 --> 00:17:40,932
Lrrr?

361
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,001
Look, we only had one date.

362
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:44,503
I barely mated with her.

363
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,004
Whatever.

364
00:17:46,072 --> 00:17:47,072
I harbor no resentment
against her.

365
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:51,576
What I want to know is

366
00:17:51,644 --> 00:17:53,945
what is up between you
and bossy boots here.

367
00:17:54,013 --> 00:17:55,147
Her?

368
00:17:55,214 --> 00:17:56,748
She's just a bossy friend.

369
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:58,316
Exactly.

370
00:17:58,384 --> 00:18:00,352
She nagged you, tormented you,
and pushed you around.

371
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,020
That is my job!

372
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:03,822
This must be settled.

373
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,425
I demand the ancient ritual of

374
00:18:06,492 --> 00:18:08,727
rrmmr-Mr-fr-mrh
or consequences.

375
00:18:10,062 --> 00:18:12,631
Rrmmr-Mr-fr-mrh or what?

376
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,575
Let the ritual begin.

377
00:18:24,643 --> 00:18:26,711
The rules are the same

378
00:18:26,778 --> 00:18:30,081
Lrrr must simply choose
between myself and Leela.

379
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:31,816
Fine, hurry up.

380
00:18:31,884 --> 00:18:33,217
By shooting the one he rejects.

381
00:18:34,962 --> 00:18:36,029
Whoa!

382
00:18:36,096 --> 00:18:37,897
Lrrr, I'm getting angry.

383
00:18:37,965 --> 00:18:39,165
Don't you go through with this.

384
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:40,967
She is not the boss of you.

385
00:18:41,035 --> 00:18:42,869
I am the boss of you.

386
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:46,873
Uh, um, oh.

387
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:48,708
Leela's going to die.

388
00:18:48,776 --> 00:18:50,743
What would delivery-boy man do?

389
00:18:56,784 --> 00:18:59,986
I-I do not want
to shoot anybody.

390
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:01,588
You never want to do anything!

391
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:03,056
Oh, nag, nag, nag.

392
00:19:03,123 --> 00:19:05,758
You want me to stop
nagging? Then shoot me.

393
00:19:05,826 --> 00:19:07,193
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

394
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:09,596
Beats staring
at your fat ass on the couch.

395
00:19:09,663 --> 00:19:11,297
Oh, yeah?
I'll show you.

396
00:19:13,701 --> 00:19:15,935
Ray-blocking power.

397
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:26,112
Fry.

398
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:31,217
Lrrr, you were willing to
shoot that bossy temptress.

399
00:19:31,285 --> 00:19:35,388
You really do value my
nagging above all others.

400
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:45,631
Good night, dumb prince.

401
00:19:45,699 --> 00:19:47,600
Come back, Lrrr!

402
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,035
I want to have your popplers!

403
00:19:50,103 --> 00:19:52,404
There'll never be
anyone but you!

404
00:19:52,472 --> 00:19:54,540
Hello.

405
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:55,941
Of course I'll marry you.

406
00:19:56,009 --> 00:19:58,110
Wait, what the shmell happened?

407
00:19:58,178 --> 00:20:01,647
I thought NDND disintegrated
you with this ray gun.

408
00:20:01,715 --> 00:20:03,149
Pfft, it's just
a cheap teleporter.

409
00:20:03,216 --> 00:20:05,451
I bought it out of the back
of a comic book.

410
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,652
Cha-Ching!

411
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,820
The teleporter gun?

412
00:20:07,888 --> 00:20:09,922
That means Fry might still be...

413
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,658
Fry?
Fry?

414
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:13,826
Is this him?

415
00:20:15,128 --> 00:20:16,996
Fry, you're alive.

416
00:20:17,063 --> 00:20:18,631
Not only that.

417
00:20:18,698 --> 00:20:21,901
I now know exactly
how to end my comic book.

418
00:20:21,968 --> 00:20:23,602
Let's watch.

419
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,504
Say good-bye
to your forehead

420
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:27,573
'cause I'm going
to shoot you in it.

421
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:30,142
Not if I leap
in front of your death ray,

422
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,011
and I am going to do that.

423
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:33,879
Jumping sound!

424
00:20:33,947 --> 00:20:35,247
I didn't shoot yet.

425
00:20:35,315 --> 00:20:39,118
As usual,
your delivery arrived too soon.

426
00:20:41,054 --> 00:20:45,791
Oh, delivery-boy man,
you saved me by random chance.

427
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:47,827
Don't thank random chance.

428
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:51,931
Thank my meteor-wishing power
with your lips.

429
00:20:51,998 --> 00:20:55,034
Mmm...

430
00:20:55,101 --> 00:20:58,304
Good ending...
not great.

431
00:20:58,371 --> 00:21:01,472
