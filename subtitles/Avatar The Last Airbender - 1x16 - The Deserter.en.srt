00:00:00,649 --> 00:00:03,021
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:03,022 --> 00:00:04,895
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:04,896 --> 00:00:07,004
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:08,296
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:13,496
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:17,575
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:21,888
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:25,048
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:29,210
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:31,050
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:36,989
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,612
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:50,433
Book One: Water
Chapter Sixteen: The Deserter

15
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:03,778
This should give us a good idea of what's around here.

16
00:01:03,844 --> 00:01:06,421
See if you can find a menu, I'm starving.

17
00:01:06,482 --> 00:01:10,704
I bet we'll find something to eat here! The Fire Days Festival.

18
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:15,179
Fire Nation cultural exhibits... jugglers, benders, magicians.

19
00:01:15,232 --> 00:01:18,672
This'd be a great place for me to study some real firebenders!

20
00:01:18,732 --> 00:01:21,876
You might wanna rethink that. Look at this.

21
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:23,573
Hey, a poster of me!

22
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:27,519
A wanted poster. This is bad.

23
00:01:27,564 --> 00:01:29,229
I think we better keep moving.

24
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:31,201
I have to learn firebending at some point,...

25
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:34,912
...and this could be my only chance to watch a master up close.

26
00:01:34,956 --> 00:01:36,904
I guess we could check it out.

27
00:01:36,949 --> 00:01:39,607
What!? You want to walk into a Fire Nation town...

28
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,020
...where they're all fired up with all their, you know, fire?

29
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:46,070
We'll wear disguises and if it looks like trouble, we'll leave.

30
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:52,331
Yeh, because we always leave before we get into trouble.

31
00:02:00,374 --> 00:02:04,973
You guys stay out of sight here while we go to the festival.

32
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:13,764
Ready disguises!

33
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,513
It's like you're a whole different person.

34
00:02:22,562 --> 00:02:24,321
Let's go.

35
00:02:39,678 --> 00:02:42,607
I think we need some new disguises.

36
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,810
Where are we gonna get masks like that?

37
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:48,729
Get your genu-ine Fire Festival masks here!

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,800
That was surprisingly easy.

39
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:02,474
Hey, there's some food.

40
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,156
Finally! What do you have?

41
00:03:05,211 --> 00:03:07,904
Flaming fire flakes! Best in town.

42
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:09,588
I'll take 'em!

43
00:03:09,658 --> 00:03:12,323
Aaahh! Hot! Hot!

44
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:16,166
"Flaming fire flakes" hot? What do you know?

45
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:18,596
Hey, look at this.

46
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,165
Don't worry loyal citizens! No one can surprise the Fire Lord!

47
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:27,059
Oh, no!

48
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:35,592
Aang, hold on! Where are we going?

49
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:38,768
I don't know, but there's a big crowd so it must be good.

50
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,637
Knowing the Fire Nation, it's probably an execution.

51
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:51,485
I gotta learn that trick!

52
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:55,672
Thank you! For my next trick I need a volunteer from the audience!

53
00:03:55,764 --> 00:03:57,221
Oh! Oh! Me! Me!

54
00:03:57,293 --> 00:03:58,718
What do you think you're doing?

55
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,595
I want to get a closer look.

56
00:04:00,664 --> 00:04:03,713
It's better that we don't attract any attention to ourselves.

57
00:04:03,794 --> 00:04:07,185
How about you, little lady?

58
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:13,383
Awww, She's shy. Leeet's give her some encouragement, folks!

59
00:04:14,676 --> 00:04:17,808
Awww! That could'a been me.

60
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:27,610
This next trick is called "Taming the Dragon." You will be my captured princess!

61
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,251
Don't worry, young maiden! I will tame this fiery beast!

62
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:49,390
It's too strong, I can't hold it!

63
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:50,854
We gotta help her!

64
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:52,820
No, we don't want to make a scene!

65
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:56,058
The rope, it's breaking!

66
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:09,541
Hey, you tryin' to upstage me, kid?

67
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:18,680
Hey! That kid's the Avatar!

68
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:23,896
I think it's time to go.

69
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,027
Follow me! I can git ya outta here!

70
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:28,134
There they are!

71
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,564
Over there!

72
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,900
I'm calling Appa!

73
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,858
I hope he can really hear that bison whistle!

74
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:48,926
This way!

75
00:05:50,264 --> 00:05:53,144
Okay! Not this way!

76
00:06:06,555 --> 00:06:09,317
Appa! Down here!

77
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:36,682
Nice touch setting off the fireworks.

78
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,899
You seem to really know your explosives.

79
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:40,228
I'm familiar.

80
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,981
You're a Fire Nation soldier!

81
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:45,595
Was. My name's Chey.

82
00:06:47,003 --> 00:06:53,053
I serve a man. More than a man really, he's a myth, but he's real, a living legend,...

83
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:59,404
...Jeong Jeong the Deserter. He was a Fire Nation general, or wait, was he an admiral?

84
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,455
He was very highly ranked, we get it.

85
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:05,203
Yeh! Way up there! But he couldn't take the madness any more.

86
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:08,250
He's the first person ever to leave the army... and live.

87
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:12,125
I'm the second, but you don't get to be a legend for that. That's okay though.

88
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,457
Jeong Jeong's a firebending genius.

89
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:18,868
Some say he's mad... but he's not! He's enlightened.

90
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,048
You mean there's a firebender out here who's not with the Fire Lord?

91
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:24,681
We've gotta go see him! He can train me!

92
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:27,174
We're not gonna go find some crazy firebender!

93
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:33,169
He's not crazy! He's a genius! And he's the perfect person to train the Avatar!

94
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:35,531
That's why I followed you into the festival.

95
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:39,201
Look, thanks for the help, but we're leaving for the north pole in the morning.

96
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:43,545
Sokka, this could be my only chance to meet a firebending master...

97
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:46,006
...who would actually be willing to teach me.

98
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,717
It can't hurt just to talk to him.

99
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,298
That's what you said about going to the festival!

100
00:07:50,342 --> 00:07:53,906
Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me!?

101
00:07:58,413 --> 00:08:01,452
Don't move!

102
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:09,941
Jeong Jeong told you not to look for Avatar!

103
00:08:09,977 --> 00:08:11,788
Hold on, you know these guys!?

104
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:15,346
Oh yeh! Lin Yi's an old buddy! Right Lin Yi?

105
00:08:15,406 --> 00:08:18,591
Shut up! Keep moving.

106
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:29,212
Go on. He sees you only.

107
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:31,670
Oh that's okay, we can chat later.

108
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:35,017
Is that where Jeong Jeong is?
I need to talk to him right away.

109
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:38,391
No! You wait there. Go now!

110
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:46,194
Don't worry! Everything'll be fine. He's a great man, great man!

111
00:08:48,197 --> 00:08:52,103
So, the Avatar was here and you let slip away?

112
00:08:52,144 --> 00:08:57,241
Yes, sir, but other than that the festival went off without a hitch!

113
00:08:57,314 --> 00:08:59,371
No fights. Theft was way down.

114
00:08:59,441 --> 00:09:04,153
I don't care about your local crime rates! Which way did they go?

115
00:09:04,213 --> 00:09:07,019
They headed into the forest, up the river I suspect.

116
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:13,345
Ready the river boats. We're going after the Avatar.

117
00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:22,560
What happened? Can I see Jeong Jeong now?

118
00:09:22,632 --> 00:09:26,104
He won't see you. He's very angry that I brought you here.

119
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:27,571
He wants you to leave immediately.

120
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,656
Finally! Let's hit the road.

121
00:09:29,712 --> 00:09:31,615
Why won't he see me?

122
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:33,081
He says you're not ready.

123
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:36,007
Says you haven't mastered waterbending and earthbending yet.

124
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:37,984
Wait, how does he know that?

125
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,320
He saw the way you walked into camp. He can tell.

126
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:44,732
I'm going in anyway!

127
00:09:52,618 --> 00:09:55,376
Get out.

128
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,908
Master, I need to learn firebending.

129
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:04,364
Only a fool seeks his own destruction.

130
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,549
I'm the Avatar. It's my destiny to...

131
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:09,813
Destiny? What would a boy know of destiny?

132
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:14,475
If a fish lives its whole life in this river, does he know the river's destiny?

133
00:10:14,505 --> 00:10:18,690
No! Only that it runs on and on out of his control!

134
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:25,852
He may follow where it flows, but he cannot see the end. He cannot imagine the ocean.

135
00:10:25,906 --> 00:10:31,260
Ookay, but it's the Avatar's duty to master all of the bending disciplines.

136
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:36,688
To master the bending disciplines, you must first master discipline itself.

137
00:10:36,738 --> 00:10:42,151
But you have no interest in this, so I have no interest in you! Now, get out.

138
00:10:42,195 --> 00:10:46,791
Please, I have to learn. This could be my only chance.

139
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:51,475
Are you deaf! How can I teach you if you refuse to listen?

140
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:55,479
Before learning firebending you must learn water and earth.

141
00:10:55,541 --> 00:11:02,889
Water is cool and soothing, earth is steady and stable, but fire, fire is alive!

142
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:07,737
It breathes, it grows, without a bender, a rock will not throw itself!

143
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:11,431
But fire will spread and destroy everything in its path...

144
00:11:11,486 --> 00:11:14,636
...if one does not have the will to control it!

145
00:11:14,668 --> 00:11:21,561
That is its destiny! You are not ready! You are too weak!

146
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:25,777
You think I am weak?

147
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:30,134
Avatar Roku! No! No! I did not mean that!

148
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:35,030
I have mastered the elements a thousand times in a thousand lifetimes.

149
00:11:35,103 --> 00:11:42,647
Now, I must do it once again. You will teach the Avatar firebending.

150
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,394
Yes, yes, I will teach you.

151
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:50,981
Really? That's great!

152
00:11:55,563 --> 00:12:05,544
Widen your stance. Wider! Bend your knees. Now, concentrate. Good, good!

153
00:12:05,588 --> 00:12:07,279
Wait! What do I do now?

154
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:12,327
Silence! Talking is not concentrating! Look at your friend, is she talking?

155
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,185
Even that oaf knows to concentrate on what he's doing!

156
00:12:15,223 --> 00:12:16,078
Hey!

157
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,089
But what am I concentrating on?

158
00:12:18,124 --> 00:12:22,939
Feel the heat of the sun. It is the greatest source of fire.

159
00:12:22,983 --> 00:12:25,888
Yet, it is in complete balance with nature!

160
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:27,342
So when do I get to make some fire?

161
00:12:27,398 --> 00:12:30,090
Concentrate!

162
00:12:40,012 --> 00:12:43,342
Are we coming up here so I don't burn anything with my fire blasts?

163
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:44,956
No fire yet.

164
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:46,882
What?

165
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,666
Power in firebending comes from the breath.

166
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,134
That is why you must master proper breath control.

167
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,173
You brought me up here to breathe?

168
00:12:55,204 --> 00:12:56,727
Assume your stance.

169
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:57,574
Wider.

170
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:58,323
You're not even look...

171
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:02,699
Wider! Now, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth...

172
00:13:02,763 --> 00:13:05,835
...without talking.

173
00:13:07,973 --> 00:13:11,737
Good. Keep going.

174
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:23,313
What are you doing here!? I did not tell you to stop!

175
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,208
I've been breathing for hours.

176
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:27,233
You want to stop breathing?

177
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:29,550
I want you to stop wasting my time!

178
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,550
I already know how to squat and breathe and feel the sun.

179
00:13:32,575 --> 00:13:37,572
I want to know how to shoot fire out of my fingertips!

180
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:42,648
I had a pupil once who had no interest in learning discipline.

181
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,630
He was only concerned with the power of fire...

182
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:47,864
...how he could use it to destroy his opponents...

183
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:54,590
...and wipe out the obstacles in his path, but fire is a horrible burden to bear.

184
00:13:54,658 --> 00:14:03,487
Its nature is to consume and without control it destroys everything around it.

185
00:14:12,703 --> 00:14:19,973
Learn restraint, or risk destroying yourself and everything you love.

186
00:14:27,481 --> 00:14:31,450
I thought about what you said. I promise I'll be more patient.

187
00:14:31,513 --> 00:14:34,524
We're going to work with fire now.

188
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:36,992
Oh yeh!

189
00:14:37,848 --> 00:14:40,970
I mean, let us begin.

190
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:47,034
Concentrate on the fire. I want you to keep this flame...

191
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:51,857
...from reaching the edges of the leaf for as long as you can.

192
00:14:51,898 --> 00:14:53,972
Master! There is trouble.

193
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,050
What's going on?

194
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:56,633
Concentrate on your leaf.

195
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:59,354
This is the worst firebending instruction ever.

196
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:03,176
All he does is leave me alone for hours to concentrate or breathe.

197
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:05,086
I'm sure there's a good reason.

198
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:09,205
But I'm ready to do so much more.

199
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,206
I did it! I made fire!

200
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:27,877
Aang, that's great, but you should take it slow.

201
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:30,148
Careful!

202
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,290
Now that's firebending!

203
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:36,988
Aang, you'll hurt yourself!

204
00:15:40,996 --> 00:15:44,180
Wonder how that juggler did it?

205
00:15:48,952 --> 00:15:53,076
Katara! I'm so sorry!

206
00:15:53,115 --> 00:15:56,462
Katara, what's wrong!? What did you do?

207
00:15:56,525 --> 00:16:00,503
Iiiit was an accident! I was... Katara, I'm so...

208
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:02,528
I told you we shouldn't mess around with this!

209
00:16:02,551 --> 00:16:07,843
Look what you did! You burned my sister!

210
00:16:19,801 --> 00:16:23,766
You burned my sister! This is all your fault!

211
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:28,152
I know. Now pack your things. You must leave immediately.

212
00:16:28,202 --> 00:16:34,408
I'm sorry, I didn't... I'm sorry!

213
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,900
You have healing abilities.

214
00:17:04,964 --> 00:17:08,926
The great benders of the water tribe sometimes have this ability.

215
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:14,535
I've always wished I were blessed like you... free from this burning curse.

216
00:17:14,563 --> 00:17:18,387
But you're a great master. You have powers I'll never know.

217
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:24,956
Water brings healing and life. But fire brings only destruction and pain.

218
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:28,849
It forces those of us burdened with its care to walk a razor's edge...

219
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:37,508
...between humanity and savagery. Eventually, we are torn apart.

220
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,642
Go get your friends and flee!

221
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:50,789
Do not come back here or you will all be destroyed. Hurry!

222
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:14,152
Don't worry, men. My old teacher gave up fighting a long time ago.

223
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:16,949
Master Jeong Jeong.

224
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:24,002
Katara! Are you all right?

225
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:29,718
I'm fine, we've got to get out of here. Where's Aang?

226
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:38,100
Jeong Jeong tried to tell me that I wasn't ready.

227
00:18:38,111 --> 00:18:41,586
I wouldn't listen. I'm never going to firebend again.

228
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:43,509
You'll have to eventually.

229
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,528
No, never again.

230
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:47,771
It's okay, Aang. I'm healed.

231
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:49,647
What? How?

232
00:18:49,691 --> 00:18:53,168
I'll explain later. But right now, we have to get out here.

233
00:18:53,181 --> 00:18:55,620
Zhao and his soldiers are attacking!

234
00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:56,385
Where?

235
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:59,085
By the river. They captured Jeong Jeong.

236
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:01,737
I have to help him!

237
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,067
Look at you. You were once so great.

238
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:10,999
I can't believe my former master has become nothing more than a simple savage.

239
00:19:11,036 --> 00:19:13,947
It is you who have embraced savagery, Zhao.

240
00:19:13,984 --> 00:19:16,492
It's Admiral Zhao, now.

241
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:19,473
That title will not help you against the Avatar.

242
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:22,608
Do not try to fight him! You are no match!

243
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:25,187
I think I can handle a child.

244
00:19:25,252 --> 00:19:29,959
I have never seen such raw power.

245
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:30,752
Jeong Jeong!

246
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:35,490
We'll see. Men! Take the deserter!

247
00:19:42,518 --> 00:19:45,093
It's a trick! He's run off into the woods.

248
00:19:45,165 --> 00:19:47,816
Find him!

249
00:19:47,857 --> 00:19:51,290
Let's find out what my old master has taught you.

250
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:53,152
You were Jeong Jeong's student?

251
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,845
Until I got bored.

252
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:02,693
I see he taught you how to duck and run like a coward.

253
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:08,978
But I doubt he showed you what a firebender is truly capable of!

254
00:20:10,246 --> 00:20:11,569
Whoa! Wild shot!

255
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,026
I'll show you wild!

256
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:23,787
No self control...

257
00:20:24,638 --> 00:20:26,785
Stand and fight, Avatar!

258
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:30,156
Oh, were we fighting? I thought you were just getting warmed up.

259
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:32,292
I was!

260
00:20:33,785 --> 00:20:40,060
Is that all you got? Man, they'll make anyone an admiral these days!

261
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:48,156
Ahoy! I'm Admiral Zhao!

262
00:20:54,675 --> 00:20:59,675
I don't know why, but I thought you'd be better than Zuko.

263
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,457
Sloppy. Very sloppy.

264
00:21:17,355 --> 00:21:22,259
No wonder to run now, you little smart mouth!

265
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:26,299
You've lost this battle.

266
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:30,542
Are you crazy? You haven't thrown a single blow!

267
00:21:30,598 --> 00:21:33,769
No, but you have.

268
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:42,272
Jeong Jeong said you had no restraint.

269
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:52,007
Have a nice walk home!

270
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:55,997
Aang, come on! Let's go!

271
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,545
Wait! Where's Jeong Jeong?

272
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:03,891
He disappeared. They all did.

273
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:15,951
Hey, where did everybody go? Very funny guys!

274
00:22:23,565 --> 00:22:26,480
Aang, you're burned.

275
00:22:27,884 --> 00:22:30,250
Let me help you.

276
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,227
Wow! That's good water.

277
00:22:43,305 --> 00:22:45,147
When did you learn how to do that?

278
00:22:45,222 --> 00:22:47,112
I guess I always knew.

279
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:50,068
Oh... well then thanks for all the first aid over the years.

280
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:52,129
Like when I fell into the grease briar bramble...

281
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:55,370
...and that time I had two fish hooks in my thumb!

282
00:22:55,447 --> 00:22:56,323
Two?

283
00:22:56,382 --> 00:22:59,794
He tried to get the first fish hook out with another fish hook.

284
00:22:59,865 --> 00:23:02,218
Oh, and the time that big snake bit me!

285
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:07,289
Thanks for healing that up. That was great. Really helpful.

286
