1
00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:09,403  X1:269 X2:450 Y1:061 Y2:082
Parasites Lost

2
00:00:47,453 --> 00:00:52,004  X1:134 X2:579 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>Breaker, breaker, this is the Duck.</i>
<i>You wanna back off them hogs?</i>

3
00:00:52,173 --> 00:00:55,927  X1:140 X2:574 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>- Ten-four. About five miles or so.</i>
<i>- Ten, roger.</i>

4
00:00:57,813 --> 00:01:01,328  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:061 Y2:083
I'd better check the fluid levels.

5
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:05,603  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:061 Y2:088
We're okay on Coke syrup.

6
00:01:09,773 --> 00:01:12,412  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:493 Y2:516
Oh, man, come on!

7
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:15,927  X1:251 X2:465 Y1:490 Y2:516
Coming through!

8
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:32,008  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:061 Y2:122
- What's that black cracker?
- A tomato.

9
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:35,125  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:455 Y2:516
You're eating a sandwich
from a men's room?

10
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,609  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:061 Y2:127
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

11
00:01:39,693 --> 00:01:43,606  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's like a party in my mouth,
and everyone's throwing up.

12
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,850  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:061 Y2:126
Look. One of them things
like on our mud flaps.

13
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:59,892  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Yosemite Sam?
- I'm gonna put my moves on her.

14
00:02:04,493 --> 00:02:09,169  X1:093 X2:622 Y1:061 Y2:126
Jerk! No one hoots at my captain unless
they wanna go to the next level.

15
00:02:09,373 --> 00:02:13,446  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:061 Y2:127
Fry, I'd rather not dignify them
with an ass-whipping.

16
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:17,368  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:450 Y2:516
Yo, sexy mama, let's get busy
and freaky, in that order.

17
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:22,084  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:451 Y2:516
How would you like it if Leela said
she wanted to make love with you?

18
00:02:22,653 --> 00:02:27,329  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:451 Y2:516
I got five minutes. She looks
pretty good for a truck-stop chick.

19
00:02:27,653 --> 00:02:32,204  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
You take that back! She does not
look good for a truck-stop chick!

20
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:35,844  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:450 Y2:516
You're right, she don't got
enough meat for me.

21
00:02:36,053 --> 00:02:39,841  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:451 Y2:516
She does too!
She's got more meat than a cow.

22
00:02:40,613 --> 00:02:43,081  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:495 Y2:516
Meat than a cow!

23
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:50,364  X1:117 X2:597 Y1:450 Y2:516
I can't please Leela no matter
what I do. I just want her to like me.

24
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:53,331  X1:184 X2:530 Y1:489 Y2:516
Well, there's always hope.

25
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,571  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:451 Y2:516
We gotta go fix
the plasma fusion boiler.

26
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:04,772  X1:237 X2:479 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Who are you?
- Scruffy. A janitor.

27
00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:09,603  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:455 Y2:516
- Why aren't you fixing the boiler?
- Schedule conflict.

28
00:03:19,213 --> 00:03:20,805  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:493 Y2:516
There, fixed forever.

29
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:28,451  X1:231 X2:486 Y1:450 Y2:516
Scruffy's gonna die
the way he lived.

30
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:34,253  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:493 Y2:516
Oh, marmalade.

31
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:42,251  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:455 Y2:516
Oh, the hypochondriac's back.
What is it this time?

32
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:45,803  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:456 Y2:516
- My lead pipe hurts a little.
- That's normal. Next.

33
00:03:53,373 --> 00:03:54,488  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:494 Y2:516
He's a witch!

34
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:58,003  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Did you eat anything unusual recently?
- No.

35
00:03:58,173 --> 00:04:01,848  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:456 Y2:516
- What about that bathroom egg salad?
- I've had better.

36
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:07,087  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:451 Y2:516
Egg salad? Zoidberg will have to
examine your gastrointestinal tract.

37
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:10,450  X1:209 X2:505 Y1:451 Y2:516
Come, everyone.
Give Fry some privacy.

38
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:19,681  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:516
If you can't see well enough, there'll
be a close-up on this video screen.

39
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:28,887  X1:174 X2:540 Y1:450 Y2:516
We'll need to have a look
inside you with this camera.

40
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:31,044  X1:274 X2:440 Y1:490 Y2:516
Guess again.

41
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:39,404  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Gross!
- Go, man, go.

42
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:49,128  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:451 Y2:516
Watch for any subtle irregularity
in Fry's bowel.

43
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:53,930  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's gorgeous.
That place used to be a dump.

44
00:04:56,453 --> 00:05:01,481  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Worms? Puke-a-tronic!
- So the eggs in that sandwich were...

45
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:06,443  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:451 Y2:516
Correct! Worm eggs. And the
mayonnaise wasn't too fresh either.

46
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:11,807  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's nauseating, man. Is there no way
to get rid of the disgusting maggots?

47
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:15,966  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:516
Only one. We'll have to travel
deep inside Fry...

48
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:18,124  X1:300 X2:416 Y1:495 Y2:516
...in this!

49
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:24,326  X1:295 X2:420 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Shotgun!
- Shotgun!

50
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:34,405  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:451 Y2:516
In each gastro-survival kit is a rain
slicker, a disposable fun camera...

51
00:05:34,573 --> 00:05:40,523  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:451 Y2:516
...and something to protect you
against bacteria: a harpoon.

52
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:45,888  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:451 Y2:516
Yo, old guy. Why do we have to use
micro-droids? Can't you just shrink us?

53
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:51,525  X1:113 X2:606 Y1:451 Y2:516
No. That would require extremely tiny
atoms. Have you priced those lately?

54
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:55,322  X1:087 X2:629 Y1:455 Y2:516
- I'm not made of money. Leave me alone!
- Me next!

55
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:14,008  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
Your net suits will let you experience
Fry's worm-infested bowels...

56
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,482  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:451 Y2:516
...as if you were actually
wriggling through them.

57
00:06:16,653 --> 00:06:20,123  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:455 Y2:516
There's no part of that sentence
I didn't like.

58
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:23,091  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Is everyone present?
- Definitely.

59
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:27,883  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:516
Here's the plan. We enter the ear,
drip down the back of the throat...

60
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:32,683  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:451 Y2:516
...and make for the bowel. There,
we'll irritate the splenic ganglion...

61
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:38,007  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:451 Y2:516
...and cause a spasm, expelling,
among other things, the parasites.

62
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:44,043  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I'll tell Fry to wash out his ear.
- No! Fry can't know about the mission.

63
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:47,569  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:456 Y2:516
If he finds out, the worms
will defend themselves.

64
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:51,965  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:451 Y2:516
- They know everything he knows.
- Like how to make ice-cream soup?

65
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:57,765  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Leela! Your role is to distract Fry.
- Can do!

66
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:01,892  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:451 Y2:516
Leela, you should really try
a facial scrub for your pores.

67
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:08,729  X1:248 X2:467 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Look, a starling!
- Really?

68
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:16,930  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:489 Y2:516
Be very quiet. We're in the ear.

69
00:07:17,093 --> 00:07:18,765  X1:246 X2:469 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Okay, professor.
- What?

70
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:20,531  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:495 Y2:516
What about what?

71
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:25,084  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:451 Y2:516
What if we go for a walk, possibly,
because it's such a lovely day?

72
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:27,170  X1:288 X2:428 Y1:494 Y2:516
I'd love to.

73
00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:33,526  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Let's go where he won't put his finger.
- It's hopeless!

74
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:37,612  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:456 Y2:516
Wait! We just have to get past
the eardrum.

75
00:07:44,373 --> 00:07:48,685  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:516
- What are they doing to Fry's brain?
- They're giving it a tune-up.

76
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:52,732  X1:124 X2:590 Y1:451 Y2:516
A quick glance suggests
they've doubled his thinking power.

77
00:07:52,893 --> 00:07:55,930  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:455 Y2:516
My God! Soon he'll be smarter
than Cher!

78
00:07:56,093 --> 00:08:00,086  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:451 Y2:516
Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious
how aromatic hydrocarbons...

79
00:08:00,253 --> 00:08:02,892  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:451 Y2:516
...can evoke deep emotions.
For you.

80
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:05,084  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:489 Y2:516
That's a beautiful thought.

81
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:08,643  X1:152 X2:562 Y1:451 Y2:516
And you expressed it
without spewing crumbs at me.

82
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:15,648  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:516
Brace yourselves. We're entering
the interior of Fry's nose.

83
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:18,281  X1:193 X2:521 Y1:489 Y2:516
We're at finger alert five!

84
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:22,685  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:516
Let's just pray nothing stimulates
his smell receptors.

85
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:25,128  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:490 Y2:516
Nobody make a smell.

86
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:34,888  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:451 Y2:516
Quick! We can escape through
that capillary into the sinus.

87
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:38,329  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:516
Usually you don't know
a thing about human anatomy.

88
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:44,284  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:451 Y2:516
I learned it from a decongestant
commercial: "Soothing action..."

89
00:08:57,013 --> 00:08:59,481  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Where are we, the ass?
- The heart.

90
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:03,202  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Better known as the love muscle.
- Which digests food.

91
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:07,241  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:451 Y2:516
We should be safe so long
as nothing makes it beat faster.

92
00:09:18,373 --> 00:09:20,170  X1:260 X2:455 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Abandon ship!
- No!

93
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,609  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:456 Y2:516
Set course for
that cholesterol-encrusted valve.

94
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:34,006  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's good cholesterol,
but it spreads like bad cholesterol.

95
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:41,962  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:489 Y2:516
They're Jazzercising Fry's muscles.

96
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:46,092  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:450 Y2:516
He'll be as strong and flexible as
Gumby and Hercules combined.

97
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,528  X1:161 X2:553 Y1:490 Y2:516
Gum-ercules?! I love that guy.

98
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:55,163  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's that jerk from the truck stop.
Let's go blend in with those pimps.

99
00:09:55,413 --> 00:09:59,406  X1:134 X2:580 Y1:450 Y2:516
I don't think so.
Sir, you owe this lady an apology.

100
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:04,084  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:455 Y2:516
Fry, no! He's bulging with
what could be muscles.

101
00:10:04,493 --> 00:10:06,768  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:490 Y2:516
I got your apologies right here.

102
00:10:11,373 --> 00:10:17,130  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:516
Sorry, ma'am. I've learned a lesson
about not ogling cans I won't forget.

103
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:22,811  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:451 Y2:516
Ah, the stomach.
Scenic gateway to the bowel.

104
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,847  X1:264 X2:450 Y1:490 Y2:516
Abandon ship!

105
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:37,490  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:516
No. Don't give up now. We're
close to the pyloric sphincter.

106
00:10:51,853 --> 00:10:53,844  X1:279 X2:435 Y1:495 Y2:516
We made it!

107
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:06,132  X1:138 X2:576 Y1:451 Y2:516
There it is,
the stately capitol of Fry's bowel.

108
00:11:06,293 --> 00:11:10,571  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:451 Y2:516
A heavily-guarded fortress
surrounding the splenic ganglion.

109
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:12,371  X1:241 X2:475 Y1:494 Y2:516
I've heard of that.

110
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:18,927  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:451 Y2:516
If we can stimulate it, the bowel
will convulse, expelling the worms.

111
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:21,687  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:456 Y2:516
But what about the worms
in other areas?

112
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:25,050  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:456 Y2:516
This is gonna be one hell
of a bowel movement.

113
00:11:25,213 --> 00:11:30,526  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:516
- He'll be lucky to have bones left.
- All right, let's mush some worms!

114
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:36,047  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:495 Y2:516
Worms to battle stations!

115
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:53,728  X1:104 X2:610 Y1:451 Y2:516
I had a great time. The flowers,
the puddle, the way you hurt that guy.

116
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:58,683  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:451 Y2:516
But can I axe you something?
Why did you do all that stuff?

117
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:01,606  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:450 Y2:516
There's something I've wanted
to tell you.

118
00:12:01,773 --> 00:12:06,449  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:451 Y2:516
But when I try, my mouth feels
like it's stuffed with peanut butter.

119
00:12:06,613 --> 00:12:09,844  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Is it about Bender?
- No, it's about you and me.

120
00:12:10,053 --> 00:12:13,682  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:456 Y2:516
- And Bender?
- Bender's not involved. Leela...

121
00:12:14,493 --> 00:12:16,643  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:456 Y2:516
...I love you.
- You do?

122
00:12:16,813 --> 00:12:20,965  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:451 Y2:516
But only recently have I been able
to articulate my thoughts.

123
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:23,693  X1:233 X2:481 Y1:451 Y2:516
I love you, Leela.
And I always have.

124
00:12:23,853 --> 00:12:27,402  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:455 Y2:516
Fry, that's the sweetest,
most wonderful... Wait!

125
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:30,531  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:456 Y2:516
Recently? Like since you ate
that sandwich?

126
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:36,166  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:516
Yeah. I don't know why, but my life
really turned around that day.

127
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:38,484  X1:291 X2:423 Y1:490 Y2:516
Stay here.

128
00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:41,371  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:490 Y2:516
Freshen your naugateena?

129
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:45,572  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:451 Y2:516
Please, I need something
to settle my stomach.

130
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:54,650  X1:185 X2:529 Y1:451 Y2:516
The nerve is through here.
Where's Zoidberg?

131
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:58,287  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:455 Y2:516
You'll never guess
where I've been.

132
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,929  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:495 Y2:516
One! Two! Three!

133
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:15,409  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:451 Y2:516
There it is.
The pelvic splenic ganglion.

134
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:19,169  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:451 Y2:516
Tickle it, then get ready for the ride
of your lives.

135
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:24,009  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Don't even think about it.
- Leela! You're in time to help.

136
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:28,491  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:450 Y2:516
If we don't get rid of the worms now,
they'll burrow so deep...

137
00:13:28,653 --> 00:13:32,532  X1:144 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:516
...not even Hermes' famous
jerk prunes could dislodge them.

138
00:13:32,773 --> 00:13:37,005  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:451 Y2:516
- I call it Caribbean Drano.
- Fry will be stuck with worms forever.

139
00:13:37,373 --> 00:13:39,091  X1:309 X2:407 Y1:495 Y2:516
Perfect.

140
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:55,051  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I'm okay.
- Leela, you ignorant dope!

141
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:58,011  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Now the worms will be in Fry forever.
- So?

142
00:13:58,173 --> 00:14:03,293  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Maybe Fry is better off with worms.
- Oh, that's stupid.

143
00:14:03,453 --> 00:14:08,322  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:516
If anyone wants to tell me what's
going on, I'll be in the lounge.

144
00:14:10,613 --> 00:14:14,208  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:450 Y2:516
Of all the parasites I've had,
these worms are among...

145
00:14:14,413 --> 00:14:18,725  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:451 Y2:516
They are the best!
How can I repay you for saving them?

146
00:14:18,893 --> 00:14:21,532  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:489 Y2:516
I'll think of something.

147
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:25,252  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:492 Y2:516
Hello, what's all this, then?

148
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,643  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:451 Y2:516
Apartment 1 -I.
The old me would joke about that.

149
00:14:30,813 --> 00:14:36,649  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's a little under-furnished. I'm
thinking of having a window installed.

150
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:38,769  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:489 Y2:516
The view's perfect already.

151
00:14:38,973 --> 00:14:43,888  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's the corniest thing I've ever
heard. Let me show you the bedroom.

152
00:14:44,053 --> 00:14:45,486  X1:281 X2:434 Y1:495 Y2:516
In a minute.

153
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:47,852  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:490 Y2:516
A holophonor?

154
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:52,370  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:451 Y2:516
Only a few people can play that,
and they're not very good.

155
00:14:52,613 --> 00:14:55,127  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:450 Y2:516
They don't have you
to inspire them.

156
00:15:46,893 --> 00:15:50,249  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:450 Y2:516
I don't have words to say
how wonderful you are.

157
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:53,803  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:450 Y2:516
I haven't felt this happy
since double-soup Tuesday.

158
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:57,244  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:451 Y2:516
With you, every day
is like double-soup Tuesday.

159
00:15:57,453 --> 00:16:01,162  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:489 Y2:516
Oh, Fry, I love what you've become.

160
00:16:01,853 --> 00:16:04,321  X1:220 X2:494 Y1:494 Y2:516
What I've become...

161
00:16:04,493 --> 00:16:08,202  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:451 Y2:516
- What is it?
- There's something I have to find out.

162
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:28,922  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Who controls this bowel?
- Who wants to know?

163
00:16:32,613 --> 00:16:36,288  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:456 Y2:516
- I am the lord mayor of Cologne!
- You mean colon?

164
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:40,048  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:451 Y2:516
- State your business.
- Have you ever been in love?

165
00:16:40,213 --> 00:16:41,805  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:490 Y2:516
I thought I was once.

166
00:16:41,973 --> 00:16:45,568  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
But then I remembered we reproduce
with spore clouds.

167
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:50,170  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:456 Y2:516
A wonderful girl loves me, but I need
to know if it's me she loves...

168
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,848  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:456 Y2:516
...or just what you worms
have made of me. So...

169
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:58,006  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:516
...I'm asking you to leave.
- Listen, you! I was born here.

170
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:03,691  X1:106 X2:608 Y1:456 Y2:516
I raised a cloud of children here. My
ancestors came here on the sandwich.

171
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:06,413  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:495 Y2:516
No one can make me leave!

172
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,051  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Get out or the brain gets it!
- He's bluffing!

173
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:46,852  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:455 Y2:516
He wouldn't willingly make
himself an idiot.

174
00:17:47,013 --> 00:17:49,811  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:489 Y2:516
Obviously you've never been in love.

175
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:04,722  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:490 Y2:516
Now, the hand-eye coordination lobe.

176
00:18:12,813 --> 00:18:14,769  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:489 Y2:516
You've damaged your brain...

177
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:18,926  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:451 Y2:516
...but no more than a few drinks
or five minutes on a cell phone.

178
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:24,208  X1:113 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516
I was working my way toward the
control center of the heart and lungs.

179
00:18:24,373 --> 00:18:29,367  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:454 Y2:516
- lf I kill myself, you die with me.
- Wait a minute, man.

180
00:18:29,573 --> 00:18:34,442  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:451 Y2:516
I hope Satan has a nice colon,
because that's where you're going.

181
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:44,052  X1:120 X2:594 Y1:450 Y2:516
Stop! We'll leave. But one day
you'll be eating a fast-food burger...

182
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:47,523  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:451 Y2:516
...and boom!
You'll be crawling with us again.

183
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:53,484  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:451 Y2:516
Ever wonder what makes
"special sauce" so special? <i>Yo</i>.

184
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:13,450  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:451 Y2:516
Fry? I missed you. Did you find out
what you needed to find out?

185
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:17,572  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:455 Y2:516
- I'm about to. Let me play for you.
- You don't have to.

186
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:22,568  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I'm still seduced from before.
- Please. It's important to me.

187
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:36,608  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:456 Y2:516
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

188
00:19:36,773 --> 00:19:40,243  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:456 Y2:516
I got nervous and started thinking
about neck bolts.

189
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:45,043  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:456 Y2:516
Wow, did you see that vase break?
It was all like:

190
00:19:45,213 --> 00:19:48,569  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:450 Y2:516
- What's happened to you?
- I got rid of the worms.

191
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:52,726  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Why would you do that?
- I needed to know who you loved...

192
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:56,772  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:451 Y2:516
...me or them.
- Well, which of you wrote that sonnet?

193
00:19:56,933 --> 00:20:02,929  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
I did! I think. It was probably 50-50.
But that's how I really felt, I swear.

194
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:06,768  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I don't know.
- Let me try to be romantic on my own.

195
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:12,291  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:450 Y2:516
I've got massage oil. I'll give you a
back rub just like I used to give Amy.

196
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:15,251  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:456 Y2:516
She always seemed to...
Uh-oh.

197
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:25,288  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:450 Y2:516
Sorry you struck out. If it's any
consolation, my life is great.

198
00:20:25,453 --> 00:20:27,728  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:490 Y2:516
Babes, bucks, I got it all.

199
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,886  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:451 Y2:516
Well, at least I learned
Leela's a lost cause. I give up.

200
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:34,931  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:490 Y2:516
There you go! Good night.

201
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:39,405  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:451 Y2:516
I gotta get up early to go
parasailing with movie stars.
