Earth...

Fire...

Air...

4

Water...

5
00:00:08,129 --> 00:00:11,909
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,213
and bring balance to the world.

00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:21,832
Zaheer infiltrated Zaofu

9
00:00:21,853 --> 00:00:23,604
and attempted to kidnap
the Avatar.

10
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:25,824
After a harrowing battle,
Korra was saved,

11
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:27,844
but she soon discovered
a shocking truth.

12
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:31,025
Aiwei, Su's trusted advisor,
has been working with Zaheer.

13
00:00:31,046 --> 00:00:33,798
This truth seer turned traitor
managed to escape,

14
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:36,100
but Su tasks team Avatar
with tracking him down.

15
00:00:36,282 --> 00:00:37,941
Now the hunted
to becomes the hunter

16
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:40,115
as Korra searches for answers.

17
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:56,918
Aiwei's definitely been
through here.

18
00:00:56,992 --> 00:00:58,314
Nice tracking, girl.

19
00:00:58,432 --> 00:01:01,210
Let's ask around.
Maybe someone's seen him.

20
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:08,590
Ooh, look,
they have a mover poster of me.

21
00:01:08,857 --> 00:01:10,558
Must be big <i>Nuktuk</i> fans.

22
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,680
Yeah. I should go
over and say hello.

23
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:15,502
No, those are wanted posters,

24
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:17,352
and there's one for each of us.

25
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:21,218
"Wanted by her majesty,
the Earth queen,

26
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:23,216
for crimes against the kingdom."

27
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:25,888
I'm guessing this is because
we took her airbenders.

28
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:27,830
They weren't hers to keep.

29
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:32,083
I swear, if I ever see her pinchy
little queen face again, I am gonna...

30
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:33,372
Uh, guys.

31
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:39,693
We should get out of here.

32
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:50,355
Where is everyone?

33
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,986
I've been waiting to leave
for half an hour.

34
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:53,899
And good morning
to you too, lin.

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,511
Now, don't get mad.
Korra's fine.

36
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,710
I'm just waiting to hear
if she tracked down Aiwei yet.

37
00:01:57,972 --> 00:01:59,885
What? You let Korra go?

38
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:02,108
I thought we were
on the same page about this,

39
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:03,961
and then you go stab me
in the back?

40
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:05,947
Oh, don't be so overdramatic.

41
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:08,117
You can't control
the Avatar's every move.

42
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:09,498
I can try.

43
00:02:23,812 --> 00:02:25,228
Naga found something.

44
00:02:33,978 --> 00:02:38,718
Oh, sorry. I forgot to bring treats.
But good girl.

45
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:45,621
This must be Aiwei's jeep.

46
00:02:45,642 --> 00:02:46,826
He can't be far.

47
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:50,729
Bolin and I will investigate
the Misty Palms Oasis

48
00:02:50,757 --> 00:02:52,178
and see if he's holed up there.

49
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,443
Yes, I love it
when you talk like a cop.

50
00:02:54,464 --> 00:02:56,036
- I'm coming too.
- No.

51
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,525
You and Asami wait here
in case he comes back.

52
00:02:58,592 --> 00:03:01,082
Besides, we don't want to call
too much attention to ourselves.

53
00:03:01,392 --> 00:03:02,059
All right.

54
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,411
Ooh. Mako, Mako, Mako,
we should wear disguises

55
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:06,012
and pretend
we're going undercover.

56
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:08,374
That way, no one
will recognize us.

57
00:03:09,308 --> 00:03:11,096
Police work is so exciting.

58
00:03:18,838 --> 00:03:21,613
All right, now we need
our undercover identities.

59
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:25,401
I'm an exunited forces
operative named "Tingting".

60
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,168
War was the only woman
I ever loved,

61
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,198
until Ivy came along
and showed me what real love is.

62
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,554
Tragically,
she was taken from me

63
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:34,172
by my archenemy Dr. Razor,
and he...

64
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,908
Enough. Let's just find Aiwei.

65
00:03:36,938 --> 00:03:39,432
But I haven't even told you
your backstory.

66
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,813
I'm a cop. I don't have a backstory.

67
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:43,563
Ooh, you're good at this.

68
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:06,498
Shoo. Human customers only.

69
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:08,650
Let's see if this guy
knows anything.

70
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:11,276
Excuse me, Sir.

71
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:15,190
We're looking for a man
about 60, balding,

72
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:17,155
wearing glasses
and a long green robe.

73
00:04:17,176 --> 00:04:20,701
And he's got this weird piercing
that goes from his nose to his ear.

74
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:22,761
- Freaks me out.
- Yeah, sure.

75
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:25,064
Sounds like a guy
who came in last night.

76
00:04:25,284 --> 00:04:28,777
I told him I had the best drinks in the
Earth kingdom, and he called me a liar.

77
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,159
That's him.
Any idea where he is now?

78
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:34,350
No, afraid not.
But he was right.

79
00:04:34,672 --> 00:04:36,205
My drinks are terrible.

80
00:04:43,758 --> 00:04:44,630
Are you okay?

81
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:46,756
I'm just frustrated.

82
00:04:47,123 --> 00:04:49,547
What does Zaheer want with me?
What's his plan?

83
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:53,799
I don't know,
but I think I found a clue.

84
00:04:58,275 --> 00:05:00,388
"Xai Bau's grove, sundown."

85
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,608
This must be where and when
Aiwei's going to meet Zaheer.

86
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,602
All right, Xai Bau's grove,

87
00:05:10,502 --> 00:05:11,777
where are you?

88
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:17,143
Go away. I'm trying to find something.

89
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,665
Well, aren't you a cute little...

90
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:26,227
Ow! Hey!

91
00:05:34,658 --> 00:05:35,594
No luck here.

92
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,648
I think there might be a couple bounty
hunters over there who recognize me.

93
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:42,111
We've been made. Let's lose 'em.

94
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:56,672
Okay, I think we're clear.

95
00:05:57,179 --> 00:06:00,022
We should head back to Korra
before someone else recognizes us.

96
00:06:01,552 --> 00:06:04,798
We could, or we could
follow Aiwei instead.

97
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,578
Look.

98
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:12,195
All right, play it cool.
Follow my lead.

99
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:14,890
Tingting always finds his man.

100
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:31,360
Keep an eye on him.
I'll go get Korra.

101
00:06:33,372 --> 00:06:35,305
We found Aiwei hiding in an inn.

102
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:38,109
- That's great.
- We found something too.

103
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:40,465
It looks like he's going
to meet Zaheer at sundown

104
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:42,804
at place called Xai Bau's grove,

105
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:45,308
but I can't find it anywhere
on the map.

106
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:48,368
Let's go bust Aiwei's door down
and finally get some answers.

107
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:52,707
No, once Aiwei knows we're on
to him, we lose our advantage.

108
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,417
I say we stake out his room,

109
00:06:54,438 --> 00:06:55,745
and when he leaves
for this meeting,

110
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:56,582
we follow him.

111
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,639
And he'll lead us
straight to Zaheer.

112
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,229
Good afternoon.

113
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,897
We'd like a room
on the ground floor

114
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:17,495
across from 102, please.

115
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:18,626
Forget it.

116
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,844
Last time a bunch of teenagers came
in here, they trashed the whole room.

117
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:24,447
We found you.

118
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:30,304
Hey, no bending in here.
Take it outside.

119
00:07:30,955 --> 00:07:33,375
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're not here to fight you.

120
00:07:33,738 --> 00:07:35,228
We're here to meet Nuktuk.

121
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:40,213
We're your biggest fans.

122
00:07:42,265 --> 00:07:44,939
Could you make it out
to Lily and Macao?

123
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:49,391
Uh, I'd be happy to.
Always love meeting my fans.

124
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:59,091
I made this Nuktuk doll for you.

125
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:03,279
Aw, it's...

126
00:08:03,864 --> 00:08:04,770
Cute.

127
00:08:05,992 --> 00:08:09,473
Why didn't you tell me
your friend was a mover star?

128
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:12,239
I'd be happy to rent you
any room in the inn.

129
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,014
We'll just take the one
across from 102.

130
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,330
But that room is too small
for the four of you.

131
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:19,601
Trust me. It'll be perfect.

132
00:08:20,754 --> 00:08:22,331
I'd just like to state
for the record

133
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:24,371
that this room is not perfect.

134
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:26,238
Naga!

135
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:33,998
There he is.

136
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:43,030
I thought stakeouts
were supposed to be exciting.

137
00:08:43,298 --> 00:08:45,148
This isn't at all.

138
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,211
Ooh, I wonder
if there's any snacks in here.

139
00:08:54,418 --> 00:08:55,246
Hey, look!

140
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,699
A Pai Sho board.
Mako, you want to play?

141
00:08:57,819 --> 00:08:59,452
Kind of busy here, bro.

142
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,379
- I'll play.
- Oh, well...

143
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,217
No offense, but I learned
street Pai Sho from Shady Shin,

144
00:09:05,238 --> 00:09:06,782
and I am pretty good,

145
00:09:06,803 --> 00:09:09,146
so wouldn't really be
a fair game.

146
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:12,703
So? I learned to play from my
dad, the diabolical genius.

147
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,037
I'll destroy you.

148
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:19,090
Well, looks like we have
ourselves a Pai shodown.

149
00:09:24,324 --> 00:09:25,478
Ladies first.

150
00:09:37,392 --> 00:09:38,354
Hmm.

151
00:09:39,432 --> 00:09:41,835
I don't want to rush you,
but let's speed things up a bit.

152
00:09:42,238 --> 00:09:42,924
Why?

153
00:09:42,945 --> 00:09:46,122
This game is all about slow,
methodical strategy.

154
00:09:46,143 --> 00:09:47,880
No, it's not;
This is a fastpaced,

155
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:49,497
edge of your seat game of chance.

156
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,948
Don't think. Just go.

157
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:52,968
I don't know
what Shady Shin taught you,

158
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:54,988
but it wasn't the real Pai Sho.

159
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:56,272
Oh, really?

160
00:09:56,293 --> 00:09:58,291
I think our friend Mr. Rule book

161
00:09:58,312 --> 00:09:59,537
might disagree with you.

162
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,750
"The origins of Pai Sho
date back over 10,000 years.

163
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:06,804
It is a game of both strategy
and chance."

164
00:10:08,385 --> 00:10:11,325
- Wait, how could it be both?
- Let me see that.

165
00:10:11,514 --> 00:10:14,863
"There have been countless variations
of Pai Sho through the centuries,

166
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:19,554
and each culture has its own rules
and variations on the game."

167
00:10:19,707 --> 00:10:20,892
That's no help at all.

168
00:10:20,978 --> 00:10:22,207
Korra, as the Avatar,

169
00:10:22,228 --> 00:10:24,145
you need to standardize
these Pai Sho rules.

170
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:25,193
Okay.

171
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:28,312
I'll put that on my "to do" list right
after "bringing back the air nation"

172
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,156
and "taking down the group
that tried to kidnap me."

173
00:10:30,372 --> 00:10:31,888
That's cool.
Whenever you get to it.

174
00:10:31,985 --> 00:10:34,813
Assuming we do find Zaheer,
what then?

175
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,366
Then I make him talk.

176
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:39,101
He was locked away
for 13 years, Korra,

177
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:40,360
and never broke.

178
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:43,404
I don't think a little bending
is going to intimidate this guy.

179
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:46,696
- You have a better idea?
- Yeah, we spy on them.

180
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:49,217
If Aiwei and Zaheer don't know
they're being watched,

181
00:10:49,318 --> 00:10:50,525
they'll talk freely.

182
00:10:50,632 --> 00:10:52,593
Then we'll know who they are
and what they want.

183
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,314
That's just like Pai Sho.

184
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:56,325
"In order to defeat
your opponent,

185
00:10:56,346 --> 00:10:58,243
you first have to know
your opponent."

186
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:00,064
Then I guess
I know you pretty well.

187
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:03,313
- I win.
- What?

188
00:11:03,868 --> 00:11:05,370
All right, all right. You know what?
That was just a fluke.

189
00:11:05,407 --> 00:11:06,486
Best two out of three.

190
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:10,732
Oh, come on!

191
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:12,065
Best four out of seven.

192
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,063
8 out of 15.

193
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:21,902
17 out of 33?

194
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:41,696
Looks like
you're on the ropes this time.

195
00:11:41,755 --> 00:11:44,846
I can't believe it.
You might actually win this one.

196
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,291
No, Pabu!

197
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:51,750
Why?

198
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:02,491
It's almost sundown.
Why hasn't Aiwei left yet?

199
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,719
Maybe he slipped out
when you weren't looking.

200
00:12:04,965 --> 00:12:08,321
No, I just saw him peeking out
the window 15 minutes ago.

201
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:10,092
It's in my logbook.

202
00:12:11,085 --> 00:12:13,287
- I'm going over there.
- Korra, wait.

203
00:12:13,308 --> 00:12:15,214
You're gonna blow
our element of surprise.

204
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:23,600
It's over, Aiwei. Where's..

205
00:12:24,305 --> 00:12:25,146
What?

206
00:12:30,045 --> 00:12:33,044
- That's a weird way to nap.
- He's not sleeping.

207
00:12:33,492 --> 00:12:35,771
He's meditating. Wait.

208
00:12:36,252 --> 00:12:39,251
Asami, those spirits were trying
to tell us something earlier.

209
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,491
Xai Bau's grove isn't on the map

210
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:43,814
because it's not
in the physical world.

211
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:44,978
It's in the spirit world.

212
00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:47,311
I'm going in after him.

213
00:12:48,105 --> 00:12:49,957
We'll watch him
in case he wakes up.

214
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:52,160
Be careful.

215
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:19,491
What happened back in Zaofu?

216
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:22,221
You told me
we wouldn't have any problems

217
00:13:22,242 --> 00:13:23,538
getting the Avatar.

218
00:13:23,606 --> 00:13:25,834
Because of you,
we've all been compromised.

219
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:29,742
No, any evidence was destroyed
when my library burned.

220
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:32,491
Where is your physical body now?

221
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:34,491
At the Misty Palms inn.

222
00:13:34,492 --> 00:13:37,100
But there is no need to worry.
I was not followed.

223
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:38,472
You left a loose end.

224
00:13:38,493 --> 00:13:42,036
I assure you
no one knows anything about us.

225
00:13:42,185 --> 00:13:44,553
No, you are the loose end.

226
00:13:45,732 --> 00:13:46,870
Zaheer!

227
00:14:02,352 --> 00:14:04,226
It seems Aiwei was mistaken.

228
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:06,941
- He was followed.
- That's right.

229
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:08,747
We knew he'd lead us
straight to you.

230
00:14:09,138 --> 00:14:10,599
So what did you do with him?

231
00:14:11,085 --> 00:14:14,685
He'll be spending eternity
in the fog of lost souls,

232
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:17,084
which just leaves the two of us.

233
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,448
Don't move, Zaheer.

234
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,209
You're gonna give me
some answers.

235
00:14:26,493 --> 00:14:28,004
There's no need for aggression.

236
00:14:28,204 --> 00:14:29,716
Neither of us has our bending,

237
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,175
and I'm not going anywhere.

238
00:14:31,373 --> 00:14:33,282
I'll answer whatever questions you have.

239
00:14:33,547 --> 00:14:34,962
You deserve that much.

240
00:14:37,386 --> 00:14:38,841
What would you like to know?

241
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,411
First off, who are you people, and
why do you keep trying to take me?

242
00:14:43,586 --> 00:14:48,469
We are part of a secret society dedicated
to restoring freedom to the world.

243
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,248
- We are the Red Lotus.
- Red Lotus?

244
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,795
Are you related
to the White Lotus?

245
00:14:54,849 --> 00:14:57,176
We are what the White Lotus
was meant to be,

246
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,242
but after the hundred year war,

247
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:02,219
the White Lotus
lost its true purpose.

248
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:06,019
Its members came out of hiding
and openly served the Avatar.

249
00:15:06,432 --> 00:15:10,889
They became nothing but glorified
bodyguards who served corrupt nations,

250
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:14,729
so a great man named Xai Bau
broke from the White Lotus

251
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,875
and began his own society.

252
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,553
That's a great story, but it doesn't
explain why you tried to take me

253
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:21,574
when I was a kid.

254
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:24,622
That was Unalaq's idea.

255
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,102
What?

256
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:28,876
My Uncle was part
of the Red Lotus?

257
00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:36,281
Avatar Korra.

258
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,857
Misty Palms inn.

259
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:42,613
- Find her.
- You two go.

260
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:45,050
I'll stay here and make sure
Zaheer's body is safe.

261
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,926
I met your Uncle
when I was a teenager

262
00:15:49,947 --> 00:15:51,946
after we had both joined
the Red Lotus.

263
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,256
We learned about Raava and Vaatu

264
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:56,957
and how Avatar Wan
foolishly severed them,

265
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,443
disrupting the balance
of the world forever.

266
00:15:59,464 --> 00:16:01,202
Avatar Wan wasn't foolish.

267
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,350
He was trying
to restore balance.

268
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:06,412
He closed the portals,
severing humans from spirits.

269
00:16:06,693 --> 00:16:08,983
Even you realize
the error in his ways.

270
00:16:09,224 --> 00:16:12,398
So all along, you and my Uncle
planned to use me

271
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:14,600
to open the portals
and release Vaatu?

272
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:17,036
That's why you tried to take me
when I was a kid?

273
00:16:17,183 --> 00:16:21,136
Yes, and with members of the red
lotus as your elemental masters,

274
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:22,998
we could've taught you so much.

275
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:26,389
Sounds like you wanted to brainwash
me so I'd do whatever you wanted.

276
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,270
No, Korra.

277
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:31,700
All I wanted was to show the Avatar
a better path for the world.

278
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:46,019
Uh, I don't know how, but water
arm lady and lava guy found us.

279
00:16:46,114 --> 00:16:48,335
- How?
- I just said I don't know how.

280
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,830
Korra, come on, wake up.

281
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:55,194
- What do we do?
- Get Korra out of here.

282
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,804
Bolin and I will hold them off.

283
00:17:05,944 --> 00:17:07,452
The Avatar.

284
00:17:25,296 --> 00:17:28,302
If my Uncle came up with a plan
to abduct me when was a kid,

285
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:29,569
why wasn't he caught?

286
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,387
He wasn't with us that night,

287
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,346
and he covered up
his involvement afterwards.

288
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,775
So he betrayed you
just like he betrayed me.

289
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,816
Yes, he allowed me and my
friends to remain imprisoned

290
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:44,325
while he pursued
his own selfish goals.

291
00:17:44,487 --> 00:17:48,307
Unalaq becoming a dark Avatar
was never part of our mission.

292
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,854
And what is your mission
exactly?

293
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,461
I want what you want,

294
00:17:52,627 --> 00:17:54,731
to restore balance
to this world.

295
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,435
I don't think our ideas
of balance are the same.

296
00:17:57,456 --> 00:17:58,849
Are you sure about that?

297
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:01,174
You kept
the spirit portals open,

298
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:02,895
but why stop there?

299
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,148
Bringing the spirits back
should only be the beginning.

300
00:18:06,546 --> 00:18:07,401
What do you mean?

301
00:18:07,701 --> 00:18:09,699
The idea of having nations
and governments

302
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,361
is as foolish as keeping the human
and spirit realms separate.

303
00:18:13,853 --> 00:18:15,852
You've had to deal
with a moronic president

304
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,632
and a tyrannical queen.

305
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,246
Don't you think the world
would be better off

306
00:18:20,306 --> 00:18:22,658
if leaders like them
were eliminated?

307
00:18:23,345 --> 00:18:24,228
No.

308
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,501
I mean, I don't really agree
with what they've done,

309
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,988
but taking out world leaders
isn't the answer.

310
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,020
It wasn't too long ago that the
airbenders were nearly all wiped out

311
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:36,790
thanks to the Fire Lord's desire
for world dominance.

312
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,370
True freedom
can only be achieved

313
00:18:39,391 --> 00:18:41,747
when oppressive governments
are torn down.

314
00:18:41,886 --> 00:18:43,339
But that won't bring balance.

315
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,236
It will throw the world
into chaos.

316
00:18:46,653 --> 00:18:47,715
Exactly.

317
00:18:47,874 --> 00:18:50,370
The natural order is disorder.

318
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:53,189
Do you know who once said,

319
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:57,729
"new growth cannot exist without
first the destruction of the old"?

320
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,741
No.

321
00:18:59,413 --> 00:19:03,163
The wise guru Laghima,
an airbender.

322
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:22,577
I can't beat this guy. It's
like I'm giving him ammo.

323
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:23,766
Want to trade?

324
00:20:07,766 --> 00:20:08,766
Go get the Avatar.

325
00:20:09,021 --> 00:20:11,120
I have these two under control.

326
00:20:35,313 --> 00:20:38,598
You know, being locked away
for so many years,

327
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:40,363
I was beginning to lose hope,

328
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:43,518
but when I awoke
with airbending,

329
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,887
I knew I would be the one
to destroy the old world

330
00:20:46,966 --> 00:20:49,756
and plant seeds
for a new world to flourish.

331
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:53,019
Zaheer, please, as an airbender,

332
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,370
you could help make a positive
difference in the world

333
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:56,879
instead of destroying it.

334
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,825
You're a very smart
young woman, Korra,

335
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,932
but you must realize
that once change begins,

336
00:21:01,953 --> 00:21:04,901
it cannot be stopped,
even by the Avatar.

337
00:21:04,922 --> 00:21:07,276
Enough with your philosophical
mumbo jumbo.

338
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:08,755
I want to know one thing:

339
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,378
If you do capture me,
what are you gonna do with me?

340
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:13,153
You'll have that answer
soon enough.

341
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,312
The Red Lotus
should have you by now.

342
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,538
See you in the physical world.

343
00:21:18,693 --> 00:21:19,736
Zaheer!

344
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:31,826
Zaheer, you tricked me.

345
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,278
Let me go!

346
00:21:33,713 --> 00:21:35,421
Asami, are you okay?

347
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,519
Where's the rest
of the Red Lotus?

348
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,404
What's the Red Lotus?

349
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,819
And Zaheer didn't capture us.
The Earth queen's forces did.

350
00:21:43,242 --> 00:21:45,366
- Where are we?
- I'm not sure.

351
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,057
Some camp by the desert.

352
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,333
They're taking us back
to Ba Sing Se.

353
00:21:53,444 --> 00:21:56,754
The Earth queen's army snatched
up the Avatar before I could.

354
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,659
But we figured you could find
a use for these two.

355
00:22:02,261 --> 00:22:03,544
Load them in the truck.

356
00:22:03,793 --> 00:22:06,038
We're taking a trip
to Ba Sing Se.

357
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,538
