Long ago,the four nations lived together in harmony

6
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:17,741
then everything changed when the firenation attacked

7
00:00:19,037 --> 00:00:22,687
Only the avatar mastered all four elements could stop them

8
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:25,767
but when the world needed him most he vanished

9
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:29,823
100 years passed, my brother and I discovered the new avatar

10
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,836
airbinder named Aang

11
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,336
And although his airbinding skill is great,

12
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:37,122
he has a lot to learn before he is ready to save anyone.

13
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:40,839
but I believe...
... Aang can save the world

We're heading to Ba-Sing-Se

17
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:55,219
Why would we go to the Earth Kingdom capital?

18
00:00:55,303 --> 00:00:57,180
The city is filled with refugees

19
00:00:58,222 --> 00:00:59,731
uh... what's Suki up to?

20
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:02,977
Actually, she and the other warriors left to fight in the war.

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,115
- Tell me where Appa is!
- I traded him!

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,860
He's probably in Ba-Sing-Se by now!

Waterbending bomb!

25
00:01:49,137 --> 00:01:54,768
Sure, 5000 year old maps from the spirit library, just splash some water on 'em.

26
00:01:55,477 --> 00:01:56,728
Sorry.

27
00:02:02,484 --> 00:02:04,701
So, did you figure out what route we're gonna take?

28
00:02:04,736 --> 00:02:07,781
Okay. We just got out of the desert, so we must be around here,

29
00:02:08,073 --> 00:02:10,665
and we need to go to Ba Sing Se, which is here.

30
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,182
It looks like the only passage connecting the South to the North...

31
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,664
...is this sliver of land called the Serpent's Pass.

32
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:17,707
You're sure that's the best way to go?

33
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:19,132
It's the only way,

34
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:21,253
I mean it's not like we have Appa to fly us there.

35
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:24,923
Shush up about Appa. Can't you at least try to be sensitive?

36
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:28,517
Katara, it's ok.

37
00:02:28,552 --> 00:02:31,179
I know I was upset about losing Appa before,

38
00:02:31,214 --> 00:02:33,807
but I just want to focus on getting to Ba Sing Se,

39
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:36,434
and telling the Earth King about the solar eclipse.

40
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:41,314
Oh, well, ok. I'm glad you're doing better.

41
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:44,132
Then to Ba Sing Se we go, no more distractions.

42
00:02:44,276 --> 00:02:46,570
Hello there fellow refugees!

43
00:02:51,283 --> 00:02:53,542
So, are you guys headed to Ba Sing Se too?

44
00:02:53,577 --> 00:02:57,664
Sure are, we're trying to get there before my wife Ying has her baby.

45
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:00,458
Great, we can travel through the Serpent's Pass together.

46
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:05,797
The Serpent's Pass?! Only the truly desperate take that deadly route.

47
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:08,842
Deadly route. Great pick, Sokka.

48
00:03:08,877 --> 00:03:09,843
Well, we are desperate.

49
00:03:10,302 --> 00:03:12,769
You should come with us to Full Moon Bay.

50
00:03:12,804 --> 00:03:17,517
Ferries take refugees across the lake. It's the fastest way to Ba Sing Se.

51
00:03:17,552 --> 00:03:20,687
And it's hidden, so the Fire Nation can't find it.

52
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:24,858
Hmmm, peaceful ferry ride... or deadly pass?

53
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:38,170
I can't believe how many people's lives have been uprooted by the Fire Nation.

54
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:43,460
We're all looking for a better life. Safe, behind the walls of Ba Sing Se.

55
00:03:53,428 --> 00:04:01,561
Who would have thought, after all these years, I'd return to the scene of my greatest military disgrace...

56
00:04:01,728 --> 00:04:03,153
as a tourist...

57
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:06,900
Look around, we're not tourists, we're refugees.

58
00:04:09,152 --> 00:04:13,990
I'm sick of eating rotten food, sleeping in the dirt... I'm tired of living like this.

59
00:04:14,324 --> 00:04:16,284
Aren't we all?

60
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:22,082
My name's Jet, and these are my freedom fighters,

61
00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:23,597
Smellerbee, and Longshot.

62
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:24,533
Hey

63
00:04:25,752 --> 00:04:26,760
Hello

64
00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:28,261
Here's the deal.

65
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:32,676
I hear the Captain's eating like a king, while us refugees have to feed off his scraps.

66
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:34,601
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

67
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:37,430
What sort of "king" is he eating like?

68
00:04:37,764 --> 00:04:39,648
The fat, happy kind.

69
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:44,521
You want to help us "liberate" some food?

70
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,236
I'm in.

71
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,962
I've told you already, no vegetables on the ferry!

72
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:06,251
One cabbage slug could destroy the entire ecosystem of Ba Sing Se.

73
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:07,627
Security!

74
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:13,508
Ah! My Cabbages!

75
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,140
Next!

76
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:24,686
Um, four tickets for the ferry to Ba Sing Se, please.

77
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:25,944
Passport.

78
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,982
Uh, no one told us we had to have passports.

79
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:32,033
Don't you know who this is? He's the Avatar!

80
00:05:32,068 --> 00:05:37,908
Ah, I see fifty Avatars a day, and by the way, not a very impressive costume.

81
00:05:41,578 --> 00:05:46,333
Besides, no animals allowed. Do I need to call security?

82
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:51,755
That won't be necessary.

83
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,929
Next!

84
00:05:52,964 --> 00:05:54,633
I'll take care of this.

85
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:58,220
My name is Toph Bei Fong, and I'll need 4 tickets.

86
00:06:00,222 --> 00:06:02,939
Oh! The Golden Seal of the Flying Boar,

87
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:07,103
it is my pleasure to help anyone of the Bei Fong family.

88
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:13,401
It is your pleasure. As you can see I am blind, and these three imbeciles are my valets.

89
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:15,028
But the animal...

90
00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:16,947
Is my Seeing-Eye Lemur.

91
00:06:18,198 --> 00:06:21,618
Well, normally it's only 1 ticket per passport, but,

92
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:23,954
this document is so official,

93
00:06:23,989 --> 00:06:26,540
I guess it's worth 4 tickets.

94
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:30,752
Thank you very much.

95
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,713
Alright, we scammed that lady good!

96
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:36,716
Tickets and passports please.

97
00:06:37,008 --> 00:06:38,385
Is there a problem?

98
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,351
Yeah,

99
00:06:39,386 --> 00:06:40,387
I've got a problem with you.

100
00:06:40,595 --> 00:06:42,104
I've seen your type before,

101
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:47,644
probably sarcastic, think your hilarious, and let me guess, you're traveling with the Avatar.

102
00:06:48,562 --> 00:06:49,945
Do I know you?

103
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,648
You mean you don't remember?

104
00:06:51,683 --> 00:06:53,150
Maybe you remember this.

105
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,958
Suki!

106
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:59,364
Sokka, it's good to see you!

107
00:07:00,574 --> 00:07:04,140
You look so different without your makeup, and the new outfit.

108
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:07,706
That crabby lady makes all the security guards wear them.

109
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:10,590
And look at you sleeveless guy. Been working out?

110
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:16,339
I'll grab a tree branch and do a few chin touches every now and then, nothing major.

111
00:07:17,048 --> 00:07:19,349
Are the other Kyoshi warriors around?

112
00:07:19,384 --> 00:07:23,388
Yeah, after you left Kyoshi, we wanted to find a way to help people.

113
00:07:23,423 --> 00:07:26,099
We ended up escorting some refugees, and we've been here ever since.

114
00:07:28,268 --> 00:07:30,569
Hi Momo, good to see you too.

115
00:07:30,604 --> 00:07:35,317
So why are you guys getting tickets for the ferry? Wouldn't you just fly across on Appa?

116
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:40,447
Appa is missing. We hope to find him in Ba Sing Se.

117
00:07:40,482 --> 00:07:42,574
I'm so sorry to hear that.

118
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:44,493
Are you doing okay?

119
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:51,291
I'm doing fine. Would everybody stop worrying about me!

120
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,301
Avatar Aang, you have to help us!

121
00:07:54,336 --> 00:07:56,261
Someone took all of our belongings.

122
00:07:56,296 --> 00:08:00,509
Our passports, our tickets. Everything's gone!

123
00:08:01,593 --> 00:08:03,678
I'll talk to the lady for you.

124
00:08:04,304 --> 00:08:06,807
No passports, no tickets!

125
00:08:07,557 --> 00:08:12,354
But she's pregnant, and all of their stuff was stolen. You have to make an exception.

126
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:13,528
No exceptions!

127
00:08:13,563 --> 00:08:17,859
If I just gave away tickets willy nilly to anyone, there would be no more order,

128
00:08:17,894 --> 00:08:21,196
and you know what that means. No more civilization!

129
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:22,531
What if we gave them our tickets?

130
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:23,007
NO!

131
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:23,766
But...

132
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:24,491
NEXT!

133
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:30,914
Don't worry, you'll get to the city safely. I'll lead you through the serpents pass.

134
00:08:37,587 --> 00:08:41,550
I can't believe we gave up our tickets, and now we're going through the Serpent's Pass.

135
00:08:41,585 --> 00:08:44,177
I can't believe you're still complaining about it.

136
00:08:44,212 --> 00:08:45,554
I'm coming too.

137
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:48,390
Are you sure that's a good idea?

138
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:50,600
Sokka, I thought you'd want me to come...

139
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:51,893
I do, it's just...

140
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:53,276
Just what?

141
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:55,689
Nothing. I'm glad you're coming.

142
00:08:59,985 --> 00:09:01,862
This is the Serpent's Pass?

143
00:09:01,945 --> 00:09:04,865
I thought it would be more windy, you know, like a serpent. Hmm,

144
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,998
I guess they misnamed it.

145
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:09,995
Look at this writing, how awful.

146
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,713
- What does it say?
- It says, "Abandon hope".

147
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:17,968
How could we abandon hope? It's all we have.

148
00:09:18,003 --> 00:09:22,048
I don't know. The monks used to say that hope is just a distraction.

149
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,718
So maybe we do need to abandon it.

150
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:26,052
What are you talking about?

151
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:30,682
Hope isn't going to get us into Ba Sing Se, and it's not gonna find Appa.

152
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:36,188
We need to focus on what we're doing right now, and that's getting across this pass.

153
00:09:37,564 --> 00:09:39,649
Ok, if you say so.

154
00:09:44,571 --> 00:09:47,372
The fire nation controls the western lake.

155
00:09:47,407 --> 00:09:52,245
Rumor has it they're working on something big on the other side, and they don't want anyone to find out what it is.

156
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:03,256
I'm okay.

157
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:10,555
They've spotted us! Let's go, let's go!

158
00:10:27,072 --> 00:10:31,660
Suki, are you ok? You have to be more careful! Come on.

159
00:10:31,743 --> 00:10:36,248
Thanks for saving my life Toph. Hey no problem Sokka.

160
00:10:52,097 --> 00:10:54,397
Suki, you shouldn't sleep there.

161
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:57,519
Who knows how stable this ledge is? It could give way at any moment.

162
00:10:57,554 --> 00:10:59,778
Sokka, I'm fine. Stop worrying!

163
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:04,067
You're right, you're right. You're perfectly capable of taking care of yourself...

164
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:04,991
Wait!

165
00:11:05,026 --> 00:11:08,405
Oh, never mind. I thought I saw a spider, but you're fine.

166
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:43,190
Guards coming!

167
00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:06,463
You know, it's o. k. to miss Appa.

168
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:09,306
What's going on with you?

169
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:11,802
In the desert, all you cared about was finding Appa,

170
00:12:11,837 --> 00:12:13,678
and now it's like you don't care about him at all.

171
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:15,520
You saw what I did out there.

172
00:12:15,555 --> 00:12:19,392
I was so angry about losing Appa, I couldn't control myself.

173
00:12:19,427 --> 00:12:21,193
I hated feeling like that.

174
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:24,279
But now you're not letting yourself feel anything.

175
00:12:24,314 --> 00:12:28,359
I know sometimes it hurts more to hope, and it hurts more to care.

176
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:32,405
But you have to promise me that you won't stop caring.

177
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,076
C'mon, you need a hug.

178
00:12:36,743 --> 00:12:39,162
Thank you for your concern Katara.

179
00:12:52,092 --> 00:12:53,760
It's a beautiful moon.

180
00:12:53,795 --> 00:12:55,428
Yeah, it really is.

181
00:12:57,347 --> 00:13:01,476
Look, I know you're just trying to help, but I can take care of myself.

182
00:13:01,511 --> 00:13:02,901
I know you can.

183
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:05,272
Then why are you acting so over protective?

184
00:13:05,397 --> 00:13:07,816
It's so hard to lose someone you care about.

185
00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:11,319
Something happened at the North Pole, and I couldn't protect someone.

186
00:13:11,354 --> 00:13:14,030
I don't want anything like that to ever happen again.

187
00:13:14,065 --> 00:13:15,824
I lost someone I cared about.

188
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:18,500
He didn't die, he just went away.

189
00:13:18,535 --> 00:13:21,830
I only had a few days to get to know him, but he was...

190
00:13:21,865 --> 00:13:25,017
smart, and brave, and funny.

191
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:27,758
Who is this guy? Is he taller than me?

192
00:13:27,793 --> 00:13:30,464
No, he's about your height.

193
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:31,756
Is he better looking?

194
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,758
It is you stupid!

195
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:34,799
Oh!

196
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:44,102
I can't.

197
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,188
I'm... sorry.

198
00:13:47,314 --> 00:13:50,567
No, you shouldn't be.

199
00:13:58,158 --> 00:14:03,246
So, Smellerbee, that's an unusual name for a young man.

200
00:14:03,622 --> 00:14:07,751
Maybe it's because I'm not a man. I'm a girl!

201
00:14:08,793 --> 00:14:13,924
Oh, now I see! It's a beautiful name for a lovely girl!

202
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:23,141
I know. You're right. As long as I'm confident with who I am, it doesn't matter what other people think.

203
00:14:23,517 --> 00:14:24,893
Thanks Longshot.

204
00:14:28,146 --> 00:14:32,609
From what I heard, people eat like this every night in Ba Sing Se.

205
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:35,153
I can't wait to set my eyes on that giant wall.

206
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:37,871
It is a magnificent sight.

207
00:14:37,906 --> 00:14:39,908
So you've been there before?

208
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:44,002
Once, when I was a different man.

209
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:46,832
I've done some things in my past that I'm not proud of.

210
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:51,419
But that's why I'm going to Ba Sing Se, for a new beginning.

211
00:14:51,461 --> 00:14:53,220
A second chance.

212
00:14:53,255 --> 00:14:55,222
That's very noble of you.

213
00:14:55,257 --> 00:14:59,302
I believe people can change their lives if they want to.

214
00:14:59,337 --> 00:15:02,597
I believe in second chances.

215
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,495
Everyone single file.

216
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:36,423
Aang, I need help.

217
00:16:03,658 --> 00:16:05,702
What is that thing?

218
00:16:36,775 --> 00:16:40,320
I think I just figured out why they call it the Serpent's Pass.

219
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:51,376
Suki, you know about giant sea monsters. Make it go away!

220
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:54,832
Just because I live near the Unagi doesn't mean I'm an expert!

221
00:16:55,499 --> 00:17:00,587
Oh great and powerful sea serpent, please accept this humble and tasty offering. Thank you.

222
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:01,630
Sokka!

223
00:17:05,342 --> 00:17:08,137
I'll distract him. Katara, get everyone across.

224
00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:41,920
Toph, come on. It's just ice.

225
00:17:43,922 --> 00:17:48,385
Actually, I'm gonna stay on my little island where I can see.

226
00:17:49,845 --> 00:17:51,138
Ok, I'm coming!

227
00:17:52,931 --> 00:17:57,686
You're doing great! Just follow the sound of my voice!

228
00:17:58,187 --> 00:17:59,980
It's hard to ignore.

229
00:18:00,397 --> 00:18:02,483
You're almost there.

230
00:18:04,902 --> 00:18:07,112
Help! I can't swim!

231
00:18:08,238 --> 00:18:09,531
I'm coming Toph!

232
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:16,788
Help!

233
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:29,134
Oh Sokka, you saved me.

234
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,346
Actually, it's me.

235
00:18:33,305 --> 00:18:37,300
Oh, well... heheh... You can go ahead and let me drown now.

236
00:19:09,591 --> 00:19:11,927
There's the wall!

237
00:19:13,554 --> 00:19:16,640
Now it's nothing but smooth sailing to Ba Sing Se.

238
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:17,606
Oh, no.

239
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:19,101
What's wrong?

240
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:20,978
The baby's coming!

241
00:19:21,013 --> 00:19:22,402
What!? Now!?

242
00:19:22,437 --> 00:19:24,363
Can't you hold it in or something?

243
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:28,610
Sokka, Calm down. I helped Gran-Gran deliver lots of babies back home.

244
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:34,616
This isn't the same as delivering an arctic seal! This is a real "human" thing!

245
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:39,371
It's called a baby, and I helped to deliver plenty of those too.

246
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:43,048
Aang, get some rags. Sokka, water.

247
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:46,712
Toph, I need you to make an earth tent. A big one.

248
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:50,883
Suki, come with me.

249
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:59,975
You know, as soon as I saw your scar, I knew exactly who you were.

250
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,444
You're an outcast, like me.

251
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:07,232
And us outcasts have to stick together. We have to watch each other's backs,

252
00:20:07,816 --> 00:20:09,825
because no one else will.

253
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:14,281
I've realized lately, that being on your own isn't always the best path.

254
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:24,374
You're doing great Ying.

255
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:26,039
Sokka! Where's that water?

256
00:20:26,074 --> 00:20:27,669
Get ready to push.

257
00:20:28,378 --> 00:20:32,508
One, two, three... PUSH!

258
00:20:36,553 --> 00:20:37,638
It's a girl!

259
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:42,810
So, you want to go see the baby? Or are you going to faint like an old lady again?

260
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:45,229
No no, I'm good this time.

261
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:53,779
Aang, you have to come see this.

262
00:20:58,408 --> 00:20:59,618
She sounds healthy.

263
00:20:59,653 --> 00:21:01,078
She's beautiful.

264
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:03,872
It's so... squishy looking.

265
00:21:07,876 --> 00:21:09,426
What should we name her?

266
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:11,797
I want our daughter's name to be unique.

267
00:21:11,832 --> 00:21:14,675
I want it to mean something.

268
00:21:18,887 --> 00:21:21,827
I've been going through a really hard time lately.

269
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:24,768
But you've made me... hopeful again.

270
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,188
I know what I want to name our baby now. 

271
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,818
Hope

272
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,360
That's a perfect name. Hope.

273
00:21:37,114 --> 00:21:41,910
I thought I was trying to be strong, but really I was just running away from my feelings.

274
00:21:41,945 --> 00:21:46,790
Seeing this family together, so full of happiness and love,

275
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:49,501
it reminded me of how I feel about Appa...

276
00:21:51,128 --> 00:21:53,130
and how I feel about you.

277
00:22:01,138 --> 00:22:03,932
I promise I'll find Appa as fast as I can.

278
00:22:04,183 --> 00:22:06,018
I just really need to do this.

279
00:22:06,053 --> 00:22:07,803
See ya in the big city.

280
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:10,572
Say hi to that big fuzzball for me.

281
00:22:11,106 --> 00:22:12,816
You'll find him Aang.

282
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:13,782
I know.

283
00:22:13,817 --> 00:22:14,818
Thank you Katara.

284
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:19,615
You ready Momo?

285
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,338
Sokka, It's been really great to see you again.

286
00:22:28,373 --> 00:22:32,092
Whoa, hold on. Why does it sound like you're saying goodbye?

287
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:36,673
I came along because I wanted to make sure you got through the Serpent's Pass safely.

288
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:39,635
But now I need to get back to the other Kyoshi warriors.

289
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:43,114
So you came along to protect me?

290
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:46,523
Listen, I'm really sorry about last night.

291
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:52,940
We were talking, and saying things, I just got carried away and before I knew it I...

292
00:22:55,275 --> 00:22:56,735
You talk too much.

293
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:39,361
Sorry Momo, Appa's gonna have to wait.

294
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:43,082
