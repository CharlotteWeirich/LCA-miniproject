What are you doing?

22
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,375
Meditating upon the meaning of sky.

23
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,837
Ugh! That's more boring
than any answer I would have guessed.

24
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,465
I'm trying to connect to the Arcanum
like Lujanne said,

25
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,342
so I can use sky magic again.

26
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:19,472
Didn't she also say you have to be born
with the Arcano-what's-it to do magic?

27
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,475
No, she said you had to connect
to the Primal

28
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,812
and that magical creatures
are born with a connection.

29
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,481
But I don't see why
I can't make my own connection.

What? No way.

00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,124

[croaks]

40
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:24,495
General Amaya, we've searched everywhere
and there's been no sign of the elves.

41
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,955
I think it's safe to conclude

42
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,458
that the outpost on the Xadian side
remains secret.

43
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,254
There, look! The signal!
The outpost is secure.

44
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,973
Yes, General. I'll ready a party.

Where are you going?

48
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,136
[Ezran] Phoe-Phoe is okay.
She's just tired.

49
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,305
She gets her power from the Moon Nexus.

50
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,725
The further away we go,
the harder it is to carry everyone.

51
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:31,271
Wow, Ez, I can't believe
you could understand all of that.

52
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,649
You did such a good job getting us so far.
Thank you.

[Phoe-Phoe coos]

54
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,787
- So, what do we do now?
- [Rayla] Well...

55
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,791
Xadia's that way.

56
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:55,962
Across miles and miles of the fluid
I both need to survive

57
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,131
and hate more than anything in the world.

58
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,884
You know what?
We'll just walk around it somehow.

59
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,969
With our legs.

60
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,053
No.

61
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,724
That's sweet, but walking around
is gonna take too long.

62
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,559
We need to get that former egg,

63
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,187
now adorable baby dragon
home to Xadia as fast as we can.

64
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,231
We've got to go straight across.

65
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,488
Well, we need a boat.

66
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,992
And a captain who knows how to make it go.

67
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:26,951
Right.

68
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,370
Specifically, a captain
who doesn't hate elves.

69
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:34,500
[scoffs] That won't be a problem.
I can disguise myself as a human again.

70
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,548
Hello, again, fellow humans,
human fellows.

71
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,134
Oh, oh! You're going to love this, Zym.

72
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,428
I'm a huge fan of human Rayla.

73
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,431
Let's go judge and criticize things
other humans do,

74
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,767
and then do the exact same thing
ourselves.

75
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,935
[laughs] Do another.

76
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,897
Sure thing, old buddy, old pal.

77
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,025
I am excited to rapidly eat
a plate of unwholesome food

78
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,985
in an excessive portion size.

79
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,904
[laughs] She's right.

80
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,049
- I'd eat a jelly tart the size of a dog.
- [Zym chitters]

81
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,034
Won't it be great to encounter
other humans,

82
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,369
and talk about which roads and pathways

83
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:14,415
will take us somewhere slightly faster
than other roads and pathways?

84
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,293
[laughs] It is so true.

85
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,670
We do love going slightly faster.

86
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,299
Hey, sometimes getting somewhere
slightly faster is important.

87
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:26,552
Like, right now.
Ezran and I will find a sea captain.

88
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,347
You stay here
and work on growing a fifth finger.

89
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,725
You've got it, my smooth-skulled friend.

90
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,720
You want me to find these items.

91
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,931
I can do that.

92
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,482
We found the perfect captain.

93
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,901
- [Rayla exclaims]
- [Zym chitters]

94
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:29,240
Uh, don't worry, that's not gonna be
a problem with this guy.

95
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:33,453
What, is he some kind of enlightened human
who can really see the good in elves?

96
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,873
Hmm. I'm not sure he can see
the good in anyone, really.

97
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,542
But that's part of what makes him
uniquely qualified.

98
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,420
We're back!

99
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,888
Greetings!

100
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,725
The name's Captain Villads.
The "D" is silent.

101
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,642
There's a "D"?

102
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,020
- Arr!
- Wait, there's a silent "R"?

103
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,103
Narr.

104
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,523
Oh, okay,
so it's just the silent "D" then.

105
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,733
Aye!

106
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,194
- Ah, so there's a...
- [Callum clears throat]

107
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,822
This is our regular human friend, Rayla.

108
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,199
Spelled like it sounds.

109
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:15,578
And her cute, unusual dogs,
Zym and Bait.

110
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,039
Ahoy, Rayla. Ahoy, doggos.

111
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,541
And this is me first mate, Berto!

112
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,959
I'm a parrot.

113
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,753
Me ship's this way.

114
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,299
Welcome to me water home, <i>The Ruthless!</i>

115
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,969
Named after me dear wife, Ruth.

116
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,054
Who sadly...

117
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,223
[sniffles] don't enjoy sailing.

118
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,533
So, you said if the wind's on our side,

119
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,203
we could make it across the bay
pretty quickly?

120
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,394
Aye!

121
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,939
'Course, there's a storm coming.

122
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,900
A storm?
That could be interesting.

123
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,778
So, we have to delay departing
for a few days.

124
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:53,366
Uh, we're on a tight schedule.
Isn't there anything we can do?

125
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,035
Hmm, I suppose if we leave right now,

126
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,371
we could race across the bay
and beat the storm.

127
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,705
Yes. Let's do that.

128
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,624
No problem.

129
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:05,294
Unless the storm catches us mid-bay,
and kills us all. [chuckles]

130
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,803
- [dolphins trill]
- [Ezran] Whoo!

131
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,140
Ye might be wondering
what happened to me eyes.

132
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,643
Well, I didn't want to be rude.

133
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,938
Me left eye was taken
by a flock of mutinous seagulls.

134
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,149
Uh, wow. And what about your right eye?

135
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,694
Don't know. Came at me from me left.

136
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,572
- [seagull squawks]
- [wind gusts]

137
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,077
Hey, wait.

138
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,831
How are we going that way when the wind
is blowing us in that direction?

139
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,417
Oh, that's how you sail, me boy.

140
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,628
[Callum] The wind doesn't push us
where we want to go?

141
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,424
The sail is more like a wing,
flying through the wind,

142
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,343
pulling the boat
against the water currents below us.

143
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,472
It's like shooting a willow melon seed
from between your fingers.

144
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,893
You squeeze in on both sides,
but the seed shoots straight out.

145
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,439
I think I get it.

146
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,274
[Villads exclaims]

147
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,778
After you're in the elements long enough,

148
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,699
you get a feel for where the wind is
and how it's about to change.

149
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,786
It's like a connection, deep in me bones.

150
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,414
Hold on, you feel a connection
to the wind?

151
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,665
How did you get that?

152
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,918
What, just because I'm blind
and have narcolepsy

153
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,563
you thought I wouldn't have sailing sense?

154
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,421
No! No, no, no.

155
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,381
That's not what I meant, I...
Wait, narcolepsy?

156
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,841
[Villads snoring]

157
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,970
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up...

158
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,723
[exclaims] What happened?
The last thing I remember,

159
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,868
I was talking about narcolepsy
and then falling asleep.

160
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,810
Yeah. That's about right.

161
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,604
[Zym whimpers]

162
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,025
[thunder crashes]

163
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,525
[whimpers]

164
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,612
Storm's a comin'.

165
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,990
Seems as if we won't beat it after all.
[laughs]

166
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,994
- Huh. Maybe it's my chance.
- A chance to die.

167
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,830
I was gonna to say my chance to learn.

168
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,083
To learn how to drown. [squawks]

169
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,202
I've never seen this rune before.

170
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,113
You expect me to drink this?

171
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,494
[liquid sloshes]

172
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,835
Ah. It's surprisingly not terrible.

173
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,562
Why should I trust you?
I don't even know who...

174
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,606
I don't even know what you are.

175
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:57,984
[sighs]

176
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,820
I need time to think.

177
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,993
[thunder rumbling]

178
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,412
[gags]

179
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:10,956
[Zym whimpers]

180
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,043
You're turning different colors.

181
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,711
Is that your Moonshadow form?

182
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:19,256
No. This is
my rare glow toad impersonation.

183
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,926
[gags and grunts softly]

184
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,303
[Bait croaks]

185
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,680
[Villads] Storm's too strong!

186
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,475
Best we moor
on the lee side of the island,

187
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,102
- and wait till it calms.
- [Berto squawks]

188
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,772
Berto, to the bow!

189
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,441
Aye, aye!

190
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,610
Port, port!

191
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,914
Current fast! Drop the sail!

192
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,172
Starboard! Starboard!

193
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,093
[Callum exclaims]

194
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,934
Port! Port!

195
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,728
[Rayla exclaims]

196
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,991
Nailed it. Squawk!

197
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,119
Did he just say the word "squawk"?

198
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:10,868
I don't understand.
Why would the outpost be abandoned?

199
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,311
They just sent the signal a few...

200
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,208
Soldier, your signal was late.

201
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,127
What happened?
Where is everyone?

202
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,588
Yes. My apologies, sir.

203
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,965
The others went on patrol,
and I missed my cue.

204
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,509
The next signal will happen
exactly on the hour.

205
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,593
[Fen scoffs]

206
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,687
[soldiers gasp]

207
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,635
[thunder rumbling]

208
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,305
[Villads] Well, we didn't beat the storm.

209
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,450
- We'll have to wait it out below deck.
- [Zym whimpers]

210
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,103
Hooray. We're wet and miserable
and we've saved no time at all.

211
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,400
Hey, are you coming or what?

212
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,652
Yeah. I agree.

213
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,444
[Rayla scoffs]

214
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,283
I know that face.
It's the "dumb idea" face.

215
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:39,206
Every time the lightning strikes,
I can feel something.

216
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,458
Yeah, me, too.

217
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,420
It feels good
to not be struck by lightning.

218
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,754
No, I mean,

219
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,966
it feels like it did
when I used the Fulminis spell.

220
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:53,595
Maybe, if I'm brave enough to go into it,
and face the storm,

221
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,119
that's how I'll make the connection.

222
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,141
Or it'll blow you up until you're dead.

223
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,436
[Zym panting and chittering]

224
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:06,150
See? Zym gets it. He can feel it, too.

225
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:10,446
- You really wanna go out there, don't you?
- [Zym whimpers]

226
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,197
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

227
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,576
It's one thing to stupidly risk
your own stupid human life,

228
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,536
but I am not gonna let you risk

229
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,538
the life of the future
King of the Dragons.

230
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,751
He is a storm dragon.

231
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,503
He'll be safe.

232
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,762
If you die out there,
I swear I'll kill you.

233
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,184
[Callum humming]

234
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,062
Okay. It's wet.

235
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,190
Mmm... The wind is blowing.

236
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,399
[wind howling]

237
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,026
It's blowing a lot.

238
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,237
I'm cold, I'm soaked.

239
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,581
Is your skin
supposed to wrinkle up like this

240
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,451
- when you understand the Sky Arcanum?
- [Zym chitters]

241
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,289
I don't think I feel any different.

242
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,337
Maybe I need to get higher up.

243
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,548
[grunting]

244
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,475
[yells and grunts]

245
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,059
[gasps]

246
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,073
[Zym chitters]

247
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,659
[Callum] I don't know
how I'm supposed to get this, Zym.

248
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,870
You're a magical creature.
Somehow, it's inside you.

249
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:46,333
But I'm just a human.
There's nothing inside me.

250
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,252
I want this so much.

251
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,505
When I could do magic,
I finally felt like myself,

252
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:56,802
and now I've lost that.
I'm just trying to find my way back.

253
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,479
It looks like the Primal Stone.
That's where we need to go.

254
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,988
[bird cawing]

255
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,623
Did a message come for me?

256
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,293
Ah, yes. Four messages, in fact.

257
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,337
Four messages came for me
and I was not informed?

258
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:36,383
Actually, we searched the entire castle.
We couldn't find you anywhere. [chuckles]

259
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,928
What, are you hiding in some
secret chamber somewhere? [chuckles]

260
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,598
I was in the bathroom.

261
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,350
Oh, right.

262
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:55,027
[gasps] The other four kingdoms
have agreed to a summit of the Pentarchy.

263
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,945
Wow, that sounds important.

264
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,365
I will rally the kings and queens
behind Katolis

265
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,410
and finally destroy the Xadian threat!

266
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,622
You are witnessing history.

267
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,124
[sighs] That is great.

268
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,045
Um, would you rate the service
you received today as excellent?

269
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,007
[thunder crashing]

270
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,889
It's a lightning rod.

271
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,615
- Maybe if I...
- [Zym whimpers]

272
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,870
No, I can't. [sighs]

273
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,750
I have to do this.
I have to understand the Sky Primal.

274
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,924
- [Zym whimpering]
- Come on, come on!

275
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,219
[grunts]

276
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,767
Ah, Callum, you're being an idiot.

277
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,896
Why would you do that?
You can't risk your life to learn magic.

278
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,899
This is crazy. [panting]

279
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,747
[all grunting]

280
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,018
[yelling]

281
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,652
Callum, what happened?

282
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,073
We went into the heart of the storm,
and Zym...

283
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,201
- he got struck by lightning.
- [Ezran and Rayla gasp]

284
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,748
- But I think he's okay.
- [Zym hiccups]

285
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,209
- [Ezran laughs]
- [Zym chitters happily]

286
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,669
What's wrong?

287
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:46,007
- I feel stupid. You were right.
- Callum...

288
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:51,429
I could have gotten Zym killed.
I put us both in danger.

289
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,764
And worst of all,

290
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,267
when we were right there,
in the center of the storm,

291
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:00,605
I thought I wanted this badly enough,
but in the end I didn't have the guts.

292
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,942
Good.
