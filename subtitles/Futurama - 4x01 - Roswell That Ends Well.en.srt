1
00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:09,529  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:495 Y2:516
Roswell That Ends Well

2
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:47,610  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:061 Y2:087
Never seen a supernova blow...

3
00:00:47,853 --> 00:00:51,528  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:061 Y2:127
...but if it's like my Chevy Nova,
it'll light up the sky.

4
00:00:51,693 --> 00:00:54,844  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:061 Y2:126
Anyone who misses this
will regret it forever.

5
00:00:55,093 --> 00:00:58,802  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:061 Y2:126
- Fry, could you go make some popcorn?
- Okay.

6
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:06,604  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:061 Y2:127
Let's go, microwave.
I'm in a hurry here.

7
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:21,926  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:061 Y2:126
- What smells like blue?
- Fry, get up here. It's starting.

8
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:24,323  X1:316 X2:399 Y1:495 Y2:516
Focus.

9
00:01:46,453 --> 00:01:50,412  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:451 Y2:516
Which crazy thing happening
are you guys screaming about?

10
00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:27,132  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:061 Y2:126
- My head is spinning.
- My popcorn's done.

11
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,729  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:489 Y2:516
It's less popped than ever.

12
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:35,484  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:061 Y2:127
I don't know what happened, but we've
taken on clocks. Let's go home.

13
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:40,568  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:061 Y2:087
Why is there so little traffic?

14
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:44,726  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:455 Y2:516
What's this layer of ozone?
That's never been there before.

15
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,127  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:495 Y2:516
Such noises.

16
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:52,246  X1:122 X2:592 Y1:450 Y2:516
There's no global-positioning signal.
Navigation is failing.

17
00:02:52,493 --> 00:02:55,530  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:450 Y2:516
- We're gonna crash!
- Not if I can help it.

18
00:02:55,773 --> 00:02:59,482  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:516
I guess I can't.
Everyone put on your seat belts.

19
00:03:00,893 --> 00:03:03,487  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:490 Y2:516
Those cost more lives than they save.

20
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:20,133  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Bender, are you okay?
- Don't know. I'll try to move my feet.

21
00:03:21,813 --> 00:03:27,922  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:516
Here's the plan. Zoidberg, pick up
the pieces. Everyone else, take five.

22
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:43,725  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:451 Y2:516
Zoidberg picks up another piece.
The crowd goes wild.

23
00:03:47,653 --> 00:03:49,132  X1:287 X2:430 Y1:495 Y2:516
What is...?

24
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:57,691  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:451 Y2:516
General, in all my years of covering
top-secret discoveries with sheets...

25
00:03:57,893 --> 00:04:03,445  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:516
...I've never dramatically revealed
anything as shocking as this.

26
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:06,765  X1:126 X2:588 Y1:490 Y2:516
The debris from an alien spaceship.

27
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:12,330  X1:170 X2:544 Y1:490 Y2:516
Son, I think I can safely say:

28
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:16,691  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:451 Y2:516
As you can see, 1 947 is going
to be an eventful year...

29
00:04:16,853 --> 00:04:20,926  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:456 Y2:516
...for the town of Roswell,
New Mexico.

30
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:34,048  X1:280 X2:436 Y1:495 Y2:516
Remarkable.

31
00:04:34,293 --> 00:04:39,572  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:451 Y2:516
According to the precision digital
chronograph, it's July 9th, 1 947...

32
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:43,772  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:061 Y2:121
...which explains why the chronograph
turned into this calendar.

33
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:46,971  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:061 Y2:087
You mean we traveled through time?

34
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:50,603  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:456 Y2:516
Some idiot must have put metal
in the microwave.

35
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:53,128  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Yo.
- And the microwave radiation...

36
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:57,042  X1:122 X2:592 Y1:451 Y2:516
...combined with gravitons
and graviolies from the supernova...

37
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:01,411  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:451 Y2:516
...blasted us through time.
- Seen today's news?

38
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:04,611  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:455 Y2:516
"Gym Renovations on Schedule"?
What a load.

39
00:05:04,853 --> 00:05:08,528  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:451 Y2:516
No, over here.
"Flying Saucer Captured."

40
00:05:08,773 --> 00:05:11,765  X1:203 X2:511 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's no flying saucer.
That's my ass.

41
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:16,928  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:456 Y2:516
My God. This means the flying saucer
that crashed in Roswell was us.

42
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:20,722  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:456 Y2:516
And the alien they captured
was... was...?

43
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:23,607  X1:322 X2:393 Y1:495 Y2:516
Hello.

44
00:05:24,973 --> 00:05:29,012  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
What are you guys doing tonight?
I'm up for whatever.

45
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:37,923  X1:098 X2:616 Y1:451 Y2:516
We tore the universe a new space hole.
But it's clenching shut fast.

46
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:43,002  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:451 Y2:516
Our only hope to get back to our time
is to go back through within, say...

47
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:46,723  X1:231 X2:485 Y1:490 Y2:516
...exactly 24 hours.

48
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:52,721  X1:106 X2:608 Y1:450 Y2:516
Ship's fixed except for the cup holder.
It should be operational in 1 0 hours.

49
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:56,323  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:516
You've got eight.
But more urgent is the microwave.

50
00:05:56,493 --> 00:06:00,532  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:451 Y2:516
Without one, we have no hope
of returning to the future.

51
00:06:00,773 --> 00:06:03,128  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:489 Y2:516
I'm sure we can buy one somewhere.

52
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:07,008  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:451 Y2:516
You sneak onto the Army base
and rescue Bender's body.

53
00:06:07,253 --> 00:06:11,644  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:455 Y2:516
I'll visit my grandfather, Enus.
He was stationed at Roswell.

54
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:17,411  X1:094 X2:620 Y1:451 Y2:516
Stay away from him, dimwitted monkey!
You mustn't interfere with the past.

55
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:22,283  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:450 Y2:516
Don't do anything that affects anything,
unless you were supposed to...

56
00:06:22,453 --> 00:06:26,446  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:455 Y2:516
...in which case, don't not do it.
- Got it.

57
00:06:26,693 --> 00:06:31,448  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:451 Y2:516
If you were to kill your grandfather,
you'd cease to exist.

58
00:06:31,693 --> 00:06:34,253  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:490 Y2:516
But existing is basically all I do!

59
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:42,806  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:451 Y2:516
- What is your purpose here?
- All right, officer, I'll move along.

60
00:06:43,053 --> 00:06:45,726  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:490 Y2:516
Why did you come to Earth?

61
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:49,283  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:451 Y2:516
Not a day goes by
I don't ask myself that.

62
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:14,122  X1:323 X2:392 Y1:495 Y2:516
Enus!

63
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:21,204  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:456 Y2:516
I want that toilet so clean
I could eat off it. Because I intend to.

64
00:07:21,453 --> 00:07:25,605  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Gadzooks, sarge.
- It's him. It's my grandfather, Enus.

65
00:07:25,853 --> 00:07:30,927  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:456 Y2:516
Now, prepare my lunch and place it
in the latrine at 1 200 hours.

66
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:39,288  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:450 Y2:516
That jeep's gonna hit him,
and I won't exist anymore!

67
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:47,442  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:490 Y2:516
You almost got yourself run over.

68
00:07:47,693 --> 00:07:52,244  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:451 Y2:516
Then I am lucky you knocked me
onto this pile of rusty bayonets.

69
00:07:52,493 --> 00:07:57,806  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:450 Y2:516
Stop interfering with history. I don't
want to have to memorize new kings.

70
00:07:57,973 --> 00:08:00,692  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:456 Y2:516
I had no choice.
I was about to not exist.

71
00:08:00,853 --> 00:08:04,323  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:451 Y2:516
I could feel myself fading away,
like Greg Kinnear.

72
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:07,570  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:451 Y2:516
Thanks, soldier.
I'm off to make sarge's lunch.

73
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:13,365  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:451 Y2:516
Handling raw chicken? Best part
of the job. Finger-licking good.

74
00:08:13,613 --> 00:08:18,562  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
We gotta get you out of here.
Everything's gonna be all right, Dad.

75
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:23,329  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Gadzooks, I'd better ask sarge.
- No time. Run! Run to safety.

76
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:38,452  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:451 Y2:516
This experiment will determine
what food, if any, the alien eats.

77
00:08:43,853 --> 00:08:47,732  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:451 Y2:516
A buffet. Oh, if only I had
my wallet with me.

78
00:08:49,053 --> 00:08:50,930  X1:303 X2:412 Y1:494 Y2:516
It's free.

79
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,450  X1:217 X2:498 Y1:490 Y2:516
Get me the president.

80
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:13,251  X1:100 X2:615 Y1:453 Y2:516
Fry's from this time. I'll talk like
him. Yo, homes, we need a microwave.

81
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:17,532  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:451 Y2:516
Never heard of that brand.
What you want is the Gas Princess.

82
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:21,487  X1:126 X2:588 Y1:451 Y2:516
This has broilers,
casserole indicator, ironing board...

83
00:09:21,653 --> 00:09:26,773  X1:109 X2:605 Y1:451 Y2:516
...and a foot-soaking tub, since, as a
woman, you'll be in front of it all day.

84
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:34,569  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:455 Y2:516
I'm sorry. Now, I'll ax you again.
Where can we find a microwave?

85
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:37,287  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:489 Y2:516
She's hysterical, so I'll talk to you.

86
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,769  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:456 Y2:516
This oven takes only five hours
to cook a roast.

87
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:46,326  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's good news. You know, you really
don't cook enough roasts, Leela.

88
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:49,202  X1:305 X2:410 Y1:495 Y2:516
Women.

89
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:56,773  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:451 Y2:516
Thank God I got you off
that Army base.

90
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:02,531  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
You sure are helpful. You got
anything to eat in that lunch box?

91
00:10:02,773 --> 00:10:06,129  X1:303 X2:414 Y1:456 Y2:516
- What...?
- Snacks.

92
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,728  X1:221 X2:494 Y1:489 Y2:516
Hey, that's my brain!

93
00:10:10,213 --> 00:10:15,412  X1:076 X2:640 Y1:451 Y2:516
Them crackers cut my mouth up something
bad. Let's stop off for a malt.

94
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:26,043  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:456 Y2:516
- See that waitress?
- I know what I want for dessert.

95
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:30,730  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:455 Y2:516
- That's my fiancée, Mildred.
- Grandma Mildred? No dessert.

96
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:33,367  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:490 Y2:516
Okey-doke. And for you, snuggums?

97
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:37,811  X1:203 X2:511 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'll have a pie
with a fried egg on top.

98
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,801  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:451 Y2:516
You ought to marry her
and father children right away.

99
00:10:43,053 --> 00:10:45,328  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:490 Y2:516
Did you ever get the feeling...

100
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:49,526  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:516
...you're only going with girls
because you're supposed to?

101
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:55,291  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:516
What?! Don't ever say or think that.
Just concentrate on staying alive.

102
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:58,372  X1:264 X2:452 Y1:495 Y2:516
Fire! Look out!

103
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:04,763  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:456 Y2:516
- You almost got neutered.
- Ain't as bad as killed.

104
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:08,289  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:451 Y2:516
For me it is.
I'm getting you out of here.

105
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:22,123  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:516
We're in the middle of nowhere,
the safest part.

106
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:25,331  X1:111 X2:603 Y1:490 Y2:516
Just stay put and enjoy this calendar.

107
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:39,572  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:451 Y2:516
Safe and sound.
Finally, I can continue to exist.

108
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,927  X1:249 X2:466 Y1:493 Y2:516
Three, two, one.

109
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:08,805  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:490 Y2:516
And you are out of here.

110
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:18,810  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:450 Y2:516
- What'll you folks have?
- I'll have soylent green...

111
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:22,761  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:451 Y2:516
...with a soylent orange
and soylent coleslaw.

112
00:12:23,013 --> 00:12:25,527  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Pardon?
- It's the 20th century.

113
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:32,212  X1:113 X2:601 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'll have a <i>croque monsieur, paella</i>,
two mutton pills and a stein of mead.

114
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:37,243  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I'll have an injection of Fem-a-slim.
- Two chili dogs coming up.

115
00:12:37,493 --> 00:12:41,122  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
Settle in.
Without a microwave, we're trapped.

116
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:45,884  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:516
Oh, lord! We'll have to endure
the horrible music of the Big Bopper...

117
00:12:46,053 --> 00:12:49,728  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:456 Y2:516
...and then the terrible tragedy
of his death.

118
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:54,529  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:516
There's a microwave radar dish
at the Army base. We could steal it.

119
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,293  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:456 Y2:516
That would alter history.
Above all else...

120
00:12:57,453 --> 00:13:01,731  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:451 Y2:516
...it is our sacred duty to preserve
the past exactly as it was.

121
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:04,168  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:490 Y2:516
Well, I killed my grandfather.

122
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:10,932  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Wait, why do you still exist?
- I don't know. Maybe God loves me.

123
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:15,772  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:495 Y2:516
Killed? In an atomic blast?

124
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:18,811  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:492 Y2:516
No, I don't take solace in the fact...

125
00:13:19,013 --> 00:13:22,562  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:451 Y2:516
...that the implosion trigger
functioned perfectly.

126
00:13:23,373 --> 00:13:26,410  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:451 Y2:516
There, there.
If it makes you feel any better...

127
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:29,963  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:456 Y2:516
...he was vaporized,
so he can't come back as a zombie.

128
00:13:30,213 --> 00:13:34,001  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I'm not worried about that.
- Then you're braver than I.

129
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:38,009  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:451 Y2:516
You remind me of Enus.
Mind walking me home?

130
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:39,652  X1:272 X2:446 Y1:495 Y2:516
How far is it?

131
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:58,728  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Welcome, President Truman.
- This visit's top-secret.

132
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:02,005  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:516
No one's to know,
except officers, scientists...

133
00:14:02,173 --> 00:14:05,529  X1:199 X2:515 Y1:456 Y2:516
...and a conspiracy nut
who no one will believe.

134
00:14:14,213 --> 00:14:17,967  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:451 Y2:516
Our experts have reassembled the parts
from the alien ship...

135
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:20,010  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:490 Y2:516
...into its original design.

136
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:27,009  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:490 Y2:516
I want this sent to Area 51 for study.

137
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:30,051  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:450 Y2:516
Where we're building
the fake moon landing?

138
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:34,923  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:455 Y2:516
We'll have to really land on the moon.
Invent NASA and tell them.

139
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:40,122  X1:098 X2:616 Y1:451 Y2:516
If you come in peace, surrender. If
you're here to make war, we surrender.

140
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,803  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:451 Y2:516
The important thing is,
I'm meeting new people.

141
00:14:44,053 --> 00:14:48,410  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:450 Y2:516
What's your mission? Are you planning
a kind of alien-human hybrid?

142
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:52,168  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Are you coming on to me?
- I take exception to that.

143
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:55,450  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:455 Y2:516
- I'm not hearing a no.
- Nerts to this crab.

144
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:59,083  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:516
We'll have to do an old-fashioned
alien autopsy.

145
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:01,845  X1:309 X2:407 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hooray!

146
00:15:08,013 --> 00:15:11,403  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:490 Y2:516
Every little thing reminds me of Enus.

147
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:18,605  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:451 Y2:516
I know how you feel.
My grandfather died recently.

148
00:15:19,613 --> 00:15:23,891  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:494 Y2:516
It's all so sad. At times like this...

149
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:27,523  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:490 Y2:516
...I just need someone to hold me.

150
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:30,731  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:489 Y2:516
You like holding me, don't you?

151
00:15:30,893 --> 00:15:34,522  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:451 Y2:516
Know what always cheers you up?
Baking me sugar cookies.

152
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,088  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:490 Y2:516
How about these cookies, sugar?

153
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,641  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:455 Y2:516
I shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't exist. But I do exist.

154
00:15:41,893 --> 00:15:46,284  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:450 Y2:516
Which proves you can't really
be my grandma...

155
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:05,322  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:490 Y2:516
Oh, my God!

156
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,449  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:490 Y2:516
What the hell have you done?!

157
00:16:12,613 --> 00:16:16,049  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:516
Relax. She can't be my grandmother.
I figured it out.

158
00:16:16,293 --> 00:16:20,571  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:450 Y2:516
Of course she's your grandmother,
you perverted dope. Look.

159
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:23,451  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:493 Y2:516
Come back to bed, dearie.

160
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:27,972  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:516
Impossible. If she's my grandmother,
who's my grandfather?

161
00:16:28,213 --> 00:16:31,046  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:494 Y2:516
Isn't it obvious?

162
00:16:31,293 --> 00:16:32,931  X1:303 X2:411 Y1:495 Y2:516
You are.

163
00:16:38,253 --> 00:16:42,929  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:451 Y2:516
Did you say something, dearie?
I'm a bit hard of hearing.

164
00:16:48,413 --> 00:16:51,723  X1:193 X2:521 Y1:451 Y2:516
Commencing excavation
of subject's chest cavity.

165
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:55,608  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:490 Y2:516
And in this corner, Zoidberg.

166
00:16:55,853 --> 00:16:59,732  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:454 Y2:516
Come on, lighten up.
What is this, a funeral?

167
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:03,246  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Heart.
- Take. I've got four of them.

168
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:08,123  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Stomach contents. One deviled egg.
- Deviled egg?

169
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:11,084  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:490 Y2:516
The same deviled egg.

170
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:17,727  X1:259 X2:456 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Snap out of it!
- Start the ship.

171
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:21,642  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:516
Let's steal the radar dish
and get back to our own time.

172
00:17:21,893 --> 00:17:23,611  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:489 Y2:516
Won't that change history?

173
00:17:23,813 --> 00:17:28,329  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:451 Y2:516
A lesson in not changing history
from Mr. I'm-my-own-grandpa.

174
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:32,003  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:450 Y2:516
Let's get the hell out of here.
Screw history.

175
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:55,408  X1:290 X2:425 Y1:495 Y2:516
UFO! UFO!

176
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:04,329  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:489 Y2:516
Don't cut that. I need that to speak.

177
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:11,852  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Holy...
- Great Roosevelt's ghost!

178
00:18:16,173 --> 00:18:18,607  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:493 Y2:516
Take this, Mr. President. Sir.

179
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:26,803  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:451 Y2:516
The president is gagging on my
gas bladder. What an honor.

180
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:32,811  X1:245 X2:470 Y1:490 Y2:516
Wha...? Oh, right.

181
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:52,008  X1:240 X2:476 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Enus!
- He's dead. Sorry!

182
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:19,723  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Choke on that, causality!
- 1 947 can kiss my shiny metal...

183
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:29,852  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:516
- We've got to go back for Bender.
- Impossible! The time hole is closing.

184
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:34,325  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:516
If we don't leave now, we'll never
get back to the 31 st century.

185
00:19:42,853 --> 00:19:44,525  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:495 Y2:516
Bender!

186
00:19:56,213 --> 00:19:59,205  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:451 Y2:516
- There, good as new.
- Don't you need this one?

187
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:02,968  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:489 Y2:516
Oh, no. That's my...

188
00:20:06,493 --> 00:20:08,609  X1:307 X2:407 Y1:495 Y2:516
Gotcha.

189
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:10,806  X1:276 X2:440 Y1:495 Y2:516
Poor Bender.

190
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:16,127  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:451 Y2:516
He must be so lonely right now,
trapped 1 000 years in the past.

191
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,846  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hey, wait a second.

192
00:20:24,213 --> 00:20:27,967  X1:289 X2:428 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Anything?
- No. Wait!

193
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:31,888  X1:279 X2:436 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Stupid jerk.
- He's alive.

194
00:20:34,813 --> 00:20:39,045  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:451 Y2:516
Bender! What was it like lying
in that hole for 1 000 years?

195
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:44,162  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:451 Y2:516
- I was enjoying it until you showed up.
- Now everything is back as it was.

196
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:48,247  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:450 Y2:516
If history doesn't care
that our degenerate friend, Fry...

197
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,450  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:451 Y2:516
...is his own grandfather,
who are we to judge?

198
00:20:51,693 --> 00:20:53,251  X1:316 X2:398 Y1:495 Y2:516
Amen.
