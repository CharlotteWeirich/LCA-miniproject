00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,427
it's my greatest treasure.

159
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:53,966
it's the last thing
i owned from growing up
in the southern water tribe.

160
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,436
you're from the southern
water tribe?

161
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,638
just like you.

162
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:00,939
how did you know?

163
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,409
i heard you talking
around your campfire.

164
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,110
but why didn't you tell us?

165
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,713
i wanted to surprise you.

166
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:12,484
i bought all this food today
so i could fix you a big,
water tribe dinner.

167
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:16,088
of course, i can't get all
the ingredients i need here, but

168
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:19,858
ocean kumquats are
a lot like sea prunes,
if you stew them long enough.

169
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,694
[gags]

170
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:22,695
great.

171
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,997
i knew i felt a bond
with you right away.

172
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,765
and i knew you were
keeping a secret

173
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,600
so i guess we're both right.

174
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,603
[grunts]
but i'm sorry we were
sneaking around.

175
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:34,473
apology accepted.

176
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,009
now let's get cooking.

177
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,220
omo chirps]

178
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,097
i'd steer clear
of the sea prunes.

179
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,399
i thought they were
ocean kumquats.

180
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,467
close enough.

181
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:04,670
who wants five-flavor soup?

182
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,509
you're a waterbender.

183
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,145
i've never met another
waterbender from our tribe.

184
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:17,282
that's because the fire nation
wiped them all out.

185
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:19,118
i was the last one.

186
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,187
so how did you end up out here?

187
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,991
i was stolen from my home.

188
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:30,162
it was over 60 years ago
when the raids started.

189
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,097
[laughing]

190
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,786
[man screams]

191
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,557
hama: they came again and again.

192
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:03,962
each time, rounding up
more of out waterbenders
and taking them captive.

193
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:08,000
[breathing heavily]

194
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,802
we did our best to hold them off

195
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:13,872
but our numbers dwindled
as the raids continued.

196
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:26,385
finally, i, too, was captured.

197
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,522
i was led away in chains.

198
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:34,493
the last waterbender of
the southern water tribe.

199
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:45,471
they put us in terrible prisons
here in the fire nation.

200
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:48,774
i was the only one
who managed to escape.

201
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,609
how did you get away?

202
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,078
and why did you stay
in the fire nation?

203
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,646
i'm sorry.

204
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:57,883
it's too painful to
talk about anymore.

205
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,818
we completely understand.

206
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,154
we lost our mother in a raid.

207
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,490
oh, you poor things.

208
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:09,561
i can't tell you
what it means to meet you.

209
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,897
it's an honor, you're a hero.

210
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:15,734
i never thought i'd meet
another southern waterbender.

211
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,037
i'd like to teach you
what i know

212
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:21,106
so you can carry on
the southern tradition
when i'm gone.

213
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:24,543
yes, yes, of course.

214
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:28,781
to learn about my heritage,
it would mean everything to me.

215
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,953
hama: growing up
at the south pole

216
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:39,992
waterbenders are totally
at home surrounded by
snow and ice and seas.

217
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,494
but as you probably
noticed on your travels

218
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,297
that isn't the case
wherever you go.

219
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,633
i know, when we were
stranded in the desert

220
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:50,336
i felt like there was
almost nothing i could do.

221
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:54,840
that's why you have to
learn to control water
wherever it exists.

222
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,343
i've even used my own
sweat for waterbending.

223
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,945
that's very resourceful, katara.

224
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,281
you're thinking like
a true master.

225
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:06,085
but did you know you can even
pull water out of thin air?

226
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:13,992
you've got to
keep an open mind, katara.

227
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:17,696
there's water in places
you never think about.

228
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:24,870
aang: this has gotta be
the nicest, natural setting
in the fire nation.

229
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,406
i don't see anything that would
make a spirit mad around here.

230
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:31,610
maybe the moon spirit
just turned mean.

231
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,446
the moon spirit is
a gentle, loving lady.

232
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,448
she rules the sky
with compassion.

233
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,784
and... lunar goodness.

234
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,321
aang: excuse me, sir.

235
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:45,557
can you tell us anything
about the spirit that's been
stealing people?

236
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,728
only one man ever saw it and
lived, and that's old man ding.

237
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,197
where does old man ding live?

238
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:55,567
katara: wow, these flowers
are beautiful.

239
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,536
hama: they're called
fire lilies.

240
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:00,906
they only bloom
a few weeks a year

241
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,543
but they're one of my favorite
things about living here.

242
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:08,547
and like all plants,
and all living things,
they're filled with water.

243
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:11,216
i met a waterbender
who lived in a swamp

244
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,919
and could control the vines
by bending the water inside.

245
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,322
you can take it even further.

246
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,765
that was incredible.

247
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,401
it's a shame about
the lilies, though.

248
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,136
they're just flowers.

249
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,572
when you're a waterbender
in a strange land

250
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,475
you do what you must to survive.

251
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:40,045
tonight, i'll teach you
the ultimate technique
of waterbending.

252
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:43,148
it can only be done
during the full moon

253
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,217
when your bending
is at its peak.

254
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,519
but isn't that dangerous?

255
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,756
i thought people have been
disappearing around here
during the full moon.

256
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,725
oh, katara.

257
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:56,428
two master waterbenders
beneath a full moon?

258
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,231
i don't think we have
anything to worry about.

259
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,642
aang: old man ding?

260
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,611
eh, ow...

261
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:13,679
aw, dad blame it.

262
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,847
what?

263
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,582
can't you see i'm busy?

264
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,118
got a full moon rising.

265
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:23,022
and why does everyone
call me that, i'm not that old.

266
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,723
[grunts]

267
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,959
aww...

268
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,927
well, i'm young at heart.

269
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:36,802
not ready to get
snapped up by some moon monster,
yet, at least.

270
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:39,104
sokka: we wanted to
ask you about that.

271
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,273
did you get a good look
at the spirit that took you?

272
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,208
didn't see no spirit.

273
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,411
just felt something
come over me.

274
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,846
like i was possessed.

275
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,884
forced me to start
walking toward the mountain.

276
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:55,587
i tried to fight it, but
i couldn't control my own limbs.

277
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:59,224
it just about had me
into a cave up there.

278
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:05,831
and i looked up at the moon
for what i thought would be
my last glimpse of light.

279
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:09,168
but then the sun
started to rise.

280
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,470
and i got control of
myself again.

281
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,973
i just high-tailed it
away from that mountain
as quick as i could.

282
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:18,243
why would a spirit want to
take people to a mountain?

283
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,611
oh, no!

284
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:21,980
<i>i did hear people screaming
under the mountain.</i>

285
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,750
the missing villagers
must still be there.

286
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,861
i can hear them,
they're this way.

287
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:43,669
hama: can you feel the power
the full moon brings?

288
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,405
[breathes deeply]

289
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:50,609
for generations, it has blessed
waterbenders with its glow.

290
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:55,948
allowing us to do
incredible things.

291
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:59,685
i've never felt more alive.

292
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,957
this is the place.

293
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:06,992
sokka: i can't see
anything down there.

294
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,828

let's go.

295
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,443
we're saved.

296
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:29,148
i didn't know that spirits
made prisons like this,
who brought you here?

297
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,883
it was no spirit.

298
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:32,351
it was a witch.

299
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,386
a witch, what do you mean?

300
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:37,589
she seems like
a normal old woman.

301
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:41,193
but she controls people
like some dark puppetmaster.

302
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:42,828
hama.

303
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,830
yes, the innkeeper.

304
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,566
i knew there was something
creepy about here.

305
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,134
we have to stop hama.

306
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,705
i'll get these people
out of here, you go.

307
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:55,441
[owl hoots]

308
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,445
hama: what i'm about to show you

309
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:04,616
i discovered in that
wretched, fire nation prison.

310
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:08,354
the guards were always careful
to keep any water away from us.

311
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:12,458
they piped in dry air,
and had us suspended away
from the ground.

312
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,230
before giving us any water,
they would bind our hands
and feet so we couldn't bend.

313
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:23,068
any sign of trouble
was met with cruel retribution.

314
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:27,773
and yet, each month,
i felt the full moon
enriching me with its energy.

315
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:31,176
there had to be something
i could do to escape.

316
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:35,914
then i realized that where
there is life, there is water.

317
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:39,385
the rats that scurried across
the floor of my cage

318
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:43,122
were nothing more than
skins filled with liquid.

319
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:49,261
and i passed years
developing the skills
that would lead to my escape.

320
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,864
bloodbending.

321
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,700
controlling the water
in another body.

322
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:58,137
enforcing your own will
over theirs.

323
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:03,308
once i had mastered the rats,
i was ready for the men.

324
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,945
[grunts]

325
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:12,051
hama: and during the next
full moon

326
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:15,287
i walked free for
the first time in decades.

327
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,622
[man grunts]

328
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:21,293
my cell unlocked by the very
guards assigned to keep me in.

329
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:25,931
once you perfect this technique,
you can control anything.

330
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,300
or anyone.

331
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:32,171
but to reach inside someone
and control them?

332
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:35,040
i don't know if i want
that kind of power.

333
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,676
the choice is not yours.

334
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:40,346
the power exists.

335
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:44,083
and it's your duty to use
the gifts you've been given
to win this war.

336
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:49,621
katara, they tried to
wipe us out, our entire culture,
your mother.

337
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:50,989
i know.

338
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:54,560
then you should understand
what i'm talking about.

339
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:58,263
we're the last waterbenders
of the southern tribe.

340
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:01,467
we have to fight these people
whenever we can.

341
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:05,004
wherever they are,
with any means necessary.

342
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:06,939
it's you.

343
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,709
you're the one who's
making people disappear
during the full moons.

344
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:14,146
they threw me in prison to rot

345
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,415
along with
my brothers and sisters.

346
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,250
they deserve the same.

347
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,252
you must carry on my work.

348
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,855
i won't, i won't
use bloodbending

349
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:25,691
and i won't allow you
to keep terrorizing this town.

350
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,126
[screams]

351
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,862
[grunts...]

352
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:33,766
you should have learned
the technique before
you turned against me.

353
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:37,136
it's impossible to fight
your way out of my grip.

354
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:41,840
i control every muscle,
every vein in your body.

355
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:47,680
[katara gasps and grunts...]

356
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:56,622
stop, please.

357
00:20:56,723 --> 00:21:02,261
[laughs...]

358
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:17,810
katara: you're not the only one
who draws power from the moon.

359
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:20,779
my bending is more powerful
than yours, hama.

360
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,949
your technique is useless on me.

361
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:44,870
[hama screams]

362
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,576
we know what you've
been doing, hama.

363
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:52,378
give up, you're outnumbered.

364
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:55,180
no.

365
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:58,050
you've outnumbered yourselves.

366
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,487
[aang and sokka scream]

367
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:09,128
sokka: katara, look out!

368
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:11,130
[grunts]

369
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:13,866
it's like my brain
has a mind of its own.

370
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:16,735
stop it, arm, stop it!

371
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:20,839
aang: this feels weird.

372
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,709
[aang grunts]

373
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,444
i'm sorry, aang.

374
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:27,112
aang: it's ok.

375
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:32,918
[sokka grunts]

376
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,386
[sokka screams]

377
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:37,423
don't hurt your friends, katara.

378
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:39,792
and don't let them
hurt each other.

379
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:42,027
[aang and sokka scream]

380
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:43,429
no!

381
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:51,503
[grunts and gasps...]

382
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:08,454
you're going to be
locked away forever.

383
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:11,023
hama: my work is done.

384
00:23:11,124 --> 00:23:13,659
congratulations, katara.

385
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,197
you're a bloodbender.

386
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:23,235
[laughs...]

387
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:28,941
