Cyber House Rules

00:00:31,293 --> 00:00:35,969  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>I gave the cookies you made</i>
<i>to the kids. They couldn 't believe it.</i>

3
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:39,284  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:061 Y2:087
<i>They were delicious. But, I digress.</i>

4
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:43,605  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>Tremble, puny earthlings!</i>
<i>One day my race will destroy you all!</i>

5
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,371  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:061 Y2:087
Can one of you guys get that?

6
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:58,882  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's a doorbell baby!
Hello, little guy.

7
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:03,803  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:451 Y2:516
- I was abandoned as a baby too. So...
- Garbage, huh? I'll take care of it.

8
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:08,450  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Bender, stop! It's a baby!
- A baby what?

9
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:14,003  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:061 Y2:127
It's just a card from
the orphanarium I grew up in.

10
00:01:15,373 --> 00:01:17,967  X1:126 X2:586 Y1:061 Y2:087
<i>Leela, you're invited to a reunion...</i>

11
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:21,688  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>... at Cookieville</i>
<i>Minimum-Security Orphanarium!</i>

12
00:01:21,853 --> 00:01:24,970  X1:187 X2:526 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Please stand clear</i>
<i>of self-destructing basket.</i>

13
00:01:26,373 --> 00:01:29,604  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:061 Y2:126
A reunion at your old orphanarium?
You gonna go?

14
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:33,647  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:061 Y2:126
No way, Jose-bot. I never want
to see those orphans again.

15
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:36,532  X1:195 X2:519 Y1:451 Y2:516
Not after the way
they used to pick on me.

16
00:01:36,693 --> 00:01:39,253  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:490 Y2:516
One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!

17
00:01:39,453 --> 00:01:43,332  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:061 Y2:087
Nice depth perception, One-eye.

18
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:46,286  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:061 Y2:121
How can you make fun of me?
You're blind.

19
00:01:46,493 --> 00:01:51,169  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:061 Y2:126
My eyes may not work,
but at least I got two of them.

20
00:01:56,213 --> 00:01:57,692  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:061 Y2:085
That's terrible, Leela.

21
00:01:57,853 --> 00:02:02,210  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:456 Y2:516
Imagine the look on their faces
when we eat all the hors d'oeuvres.

22
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:06,048  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:450 Y2:516
Well, I wouldn't mind rubbing
my success in a few faces.

23
00:02:06,253 --> 00:02:08,005  X1:179 X2:535 Y1:495 Y2:516
Set a course for adventure!

24
00:02:14,893 --> 00:02:15,928  X1:266 X2:448 Y1:490 Y2:516
What a dump!

25
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:19,326  X1:234 X2:480 Y1:495 Y2:516
Just like old times.

26
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:25,324  X1:126 X2:588 Y1:456 Y2:516
Gosh, the bars on the windows
seemed so much thicker back then.

27
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:27,764  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:490 Y2:516
Mr. Vogel, remember me?

28
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:32,285  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:450 Y2:516
Leela, you're worthless,
and no one will ever love you!

29
00:02:32,493 --> 00:02:37,044  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:451 Y2:516
- You used to say that all the time.
- Oh, those were happier days.

30
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:47,531  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:456 Y2:516
The gristle in a blanket
isn't half bad.

31
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:51,123  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:451 Y2:516
Try the Popsicle sticks.
They've absorbed a lot of flavor.

32
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:55,121  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:489 Y2:516
Hey, look, it's our old group picture.

33
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:59,406  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:455 Y2:516
- I don't see you anywhere.
- That's me over in Cootietown.

34
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:02,173  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:451 Y2:516
Get a load of this
average-looking guy.

35
00:03:02,373 --> 00:03:06,332  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:455 Y2:516
That's Adlai Atkins. I used
to have kind of a crush on him.

36
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:10,687  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:451 Y2:516
- One-eye! One-eye!
- Stupid as a French guy!

37
00:03:21,653 --> 00:03:25,931  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:450 Y2:516
Well, it's time to say hello
to the old gang.

38
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:35,806  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:451 Y2:516
So, what you been up to
since you left?

39
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:41,445  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Living in a box. You?
- Selling kidneys, teeth, whatever.

40
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:46,482  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:451 Y2:516
And what am I up to, you ask? Why,
I'm a very successful space captain.

41
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,002  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Wow.
- How nice for you, Leela.

42
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:52,285  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's so good for a person
with one eye.

43
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:55,007  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:489 Y2:516
Hey, you can't feel sorry for me.

44
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:58,370  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm a space captain,
and you're a bunch of losers.

45
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:01,964  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:489 Y2:516
Right, right. We're the losers.

46
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:06,369  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:489 Y2:516
Well, if it isn't old One-eye.

47
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:12,122  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Oh, yeah? Well, shut up, cane-boy!
- He can't hear you. He's deaf now.

48
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,405  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:451 Y2:516
Leave her alone.
She's leading a normal life.

49
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:19,248  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:455 Y2:516
She's not gussied up,
duded out or where it's at.

50
00:04:19,453 --> 00:04:21,683  X1:254 X2:461 Y1:490 Y2:516
Now, run along.

51
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:28,327  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:451 Y2:516
Thanks, Adlai. I guess you never
outgrow being an eyeball. Oddball.

52
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:32,367  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:516
Nonsense. You're a captain.
That's a fine profession.

53
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:35,883  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:516
Well, it's just for a package
delivery service.

54
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:40,083  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:456 Y2:516
A package is just a box
until it's delivered.

55
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:43,529  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'd never thought of it that way.
What do you do?

56
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:47,129  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I'm a doctor.
- A tall doctor, you say?

57
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,211  X1:220 X2:494 Y1:490 Y2:516
Sir, you seem stable.

58
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:58,047  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Have you thought about adopting?
- No.

59
00:04:58,293 --> 00:05:01,569  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:455 Y2:516
It's a great way to have
a kid without sex.

60
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:03,485  X1:314 X2:404 Y1:490 Y2:516
Really?

61
00:05:03,893 --> 00:05:06,930  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:455 Y2:516
The government will help
with $ 1 00 a week.

62
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:10,085  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:495 Y2:516
A hundred dollars a week?

63
00:05:12,693 --> 00:05:15,730  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm so sorry I teased you.
Let me make it up.

64
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:19,682  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I'll fix it so no one teases you.
- By beating them up?

65
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:23,767  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:455 Y2:516
I broke that blind kid's nose,
and it made no difference.

66
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:26,567  X1:213 X2:501 Y1:451 Y2:516
No, I specialize
in phaser eye surgery.

67
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:30,123  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:451 Y2:516
I can build you a paraffin eye
and graft it on.

68
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:35,493  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:516
It won't be able to see, but you'll
look like a normal two-eyed person.

69
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:39,692  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:490 Y2:516
Me? Perfectly normal?

70
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,608  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:490 Y2:516
Sons, daughters, meet Uncle Fry.

71
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:51,651  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:451 Y2:516
Why are they with you?
Do you have candy?

72
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:54,413  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:489 Y2:516
No. It's called parenting.

73
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:58,845  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:516
Come on, dumplings, we've got
1 2 government stipends to collect.

74
00:05:59,013 --> 00:06:01,004  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:489 Y2:516
Our daddy's a giant toy!

75
00:06:02,373 --> 00:06:05,126  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:490 Y2:516
Phaser eye surgery is a capital idea.

76
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:11,090  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm sure Leela's tired of morons
gaping at her eye all the time.

77
00:06:12,613 --> 00:06:16,083  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:455 Y2:516
Cosmetic surgery's great.
I used to be too cute...

78
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:20,246  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:451 Y2:516
...so I had cuteness reduction
surgery here and here.

79
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:24,651  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:516
You're crazy! Leela doesn't
need surgery. You look great now.

80
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:29,770  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's so sweet, Fry. But for once,
I just want to look normal.

81
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:34,563  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:516
You're better, you're abnormal!
You shouldn't care what people think.

82
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:37,725  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'll start by not caring
what you think.

83
00:06:37,973 --> 00:06:39,611  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:489 Y2:516
I'm getting the surgery.

84
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:42,691  X1:283 X2:433 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Thattagirl!
- Wonderful!

85
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:47,011  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:451 Y2:516
You can also get an ink pouch
to help you escape your enemies.

86
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:51,371  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's the stupidest idea
I've ever heard, you imbecile!

87
00:06:58,253 --> 00:07:03,885  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:516
Now we'll find out if the operation
was a success. Hold on to your hats.

88
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:16,330  X1:190 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:516
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is the wrong patient.

89
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:49,731  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Those eyes look so great on you!
- She looked fine before.

90
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:51,691  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:451 Y2:516
- No.
- Wrong.

91
00:07:51,893 --> 00:07:53,406  X1:242 X2:473 Y1:493 Y2:516
Wow, look at me!

92
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,331  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:455 Y2:516
- I don't have the hang of blinking.
- You will.

93
00:07:57,573 --> 00:08:03,887  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:451 Y2:516
I try not to blink too much, because
it's flashy. But when I do, I enjoy it.

94
00:08:04,573 --> 00:08:06,165  X1:258 X2:457 Y1:495 Y2:516
I did it! I blunk!

95
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:09,012  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:451 Y2:516
Just in time
to screw up this picture!

96
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:10,208  X1:309 X2:407 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hooray!

97
00:08:51,293 --> 00:08:57,368  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:516
I've never felt so unremarkable! Today
I actually blended in with a crowd!

98
00:09:02,973 --> 00:09:07,489  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Kids, meet the jerk-bags I work with.
- Hello, jerk-bags!

99
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:11,732  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:455 Y2:516
- They're so cute! What are their names?
- Kids have names?

100
00:09:11,933 --> 00:09:17,565  X1:092 X2:623 Y1:450 Y2:516
- My name's Nina, and his name's Albert.
- Now you're all named Bender Jr.!

101
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:20,452  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:451 Y2:516
Look! My first government
stipend check.

102
00:09:20,613 --> 00:09:25,084  X1:089 X2:625 Y1:490 Y2:516
Twelve baby humans, 1 200 wing-wangs.

103
00:09:25,293 --> 00:09:28,490  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:489 Y2:516
Daddy Bender, we're hungry.

104
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:34,086  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:451 Y2:516
What is it with you kids?
Every other day, it's food, food, food!

105
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:37,890  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:450 Y2:516
Oh, fine. I'll get you
some stupid food.

106
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:41,688  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Can we have Bender burgers?
- The cat shelter's onto me.

107
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:46,528  X1:279 X2:437 Y1:493 Y2:516
Hello, Leela.

108
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:51,887  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
I was getting one of my shirts toned
down, so I dropped in for your exam.

109
00:09:52,573 --> 00:09:56,407  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:516
- That's handsome of you.
- Follow the light with your eyes.

110
00:09:58,853 --> 00:10:02,528  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:451 Y2:516
Perfect. A guy could fall
head over heels for you.

111
00:10:02,773 --> 00:10:06,049  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I'm interested myself.
- What are you saying?

112
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:10,132  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:455 Y2:516
I'm not good with words,
so I'm in a delicate conundrum.

113
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:12,523  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Will you go out with me?
- Sure.

114
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:18,806  X1:107 X2:605 Y1:450 Y2:516
I don't know what else to say, so I'll
just say it. Okey-dokey, see you then.

115
00:10:18,973 --> 00:10:22,204  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:451 Y2:516
This is so unfair.
I liked you as a cyclops.

116
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:26,082  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:450 Y2:516
- He's only interested in your eyes.
- You're just jealous.

117
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:30,206  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:450 Y2:516
No, I'm not! Wait, I am!
But my point remains valid!

118
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:34,326  X1:113 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516
I want to try dating a man,
who if you go somewhere with him...

119
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:38,281  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:455 Y2:516
...no one says he's crummy.
I deserve that once in life.

120
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:42,321  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:451 Y2:516
Be careful with that Adlai.
He's a doctor. They're poor.

121
00:10:42,573 --> 00:10:45,690  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Most doctors are rich.
- When did this happen?

122
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:48,612  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:450 Y2:516
You're joking, right?
That's not funny!

123
00:10:51,053 --> 00:10:53,009  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:490 Y2:516
They got everything you need:

124
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:56,484  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:451 Y2:516
Booze, peanuts, they got
a crapper in the back...

125
00:10:56,653 --> 00:10:58,928  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:455 Y2:516
- That's something you do, right?
- Yeah.

126
00:10:59,173 --> 00:11:01,892  X1:195 X2:519 Y1:490 Y2:516
Then knock yourself out.

127
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:06,007  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:451 Y2:516
Only eat and drink enough
to keep yourselves alive!

128
00:11:06,253 --> 00:11:09,290  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:489 Y2:516
I'm trying to make a profit here.

129
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:17,082  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:455 Y2:516
- Daddy, Bethany's hitting me!
- Here.

130
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:21,493  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:456 Y2:516
- These kids yours?
- Yeah.

131
00:11:21,693 --> 00:11:25,527  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:451 Y2:516
- I like a man with responsibility.
- That's me, baby.

132
00:11:25,773 --> 00:11:30,210  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:451 Y2:516
Let me ditch the kids in an alley,
and we can go have some fun.

133
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:33,211  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Daddy Bender?
- Daddy's trying to score...

134
00:11:33,453 --> 00:11:37,890  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:451 Y2:516
...with a cheap floozy right now,
so cram a Tinkertoy in it.

135
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:41,483  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:490 Y2:516
I love you, Daddy Bender.

136
00:11:41,653 --> 00:11:46,408  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:451 Y2:516
- What the hell? Quit hugging me!
- I guess you're busy. Catch you later.

137
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:49,770  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:489 Y2:516
You morons! I've got half a mind...

138
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:54,165  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:451 Y2:516
...to hug each and every one of you,
and see how you like it!

139
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:56,691  X1:297 X2:419 Y1:495 Y2:516
Come on.

140
00:12:00,413 --> 00:12:03,723  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'll take you someplace
no one could object to.

141
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,406  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:495 Y2:516
That sounds wonderful.

142
00:12:12,053 --> 00:12:17,081  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:061 Y2:127
I'd like an extra-beautiful bouquet
for my extra-gorgeous sweetheart.

143
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:21,482  X1:249 X2:465 Y1:061 Y2:087
Average, please.

144
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:26,011  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:450 Y2:516
Adlai, I've had
a wonderful time today.

145
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:30,804  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:450 Y2:516
No one's stared at me or avoided
staring or tried to burn me.

146
00:12:31,053 --> 00:12:33,647  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:495 Y2:516
You make me feel so not weird.

147
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:38,643  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:489 Y2:516
Leela, you're 999,999 in a million.

148
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:55,009  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:451 Y2:516
Thanks for coming to get
to know Adlai. Isn't he dreamy?

149
00:12:55,213 --> 00:12:56,692  X1:310 X2:405 Y1:490 Y2:516
Totally.

150
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:04,089  X1:153 X2:561 Y1:451 Y2:516
Listen, I want you all to know
your Leela's one standard lady.

151
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:06,045  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:490 Y2:516
Oh, Adlai, stop.

152
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:09,689  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:450 Y2:516
What's wonderful about Leela
being normal? We aren't.

153
00:13:09,853 --> 00:13:12,925  X1:171 X2:543 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's what makes us great.
Like Dr. Zoidberg.

154
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:16,961  X1:089 X2:626 Y1:450 Y2:516
- He's a weird monster who eats garbage.
- Damn right.

155
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:21,132  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:450 Y2:516
And the professor's a senile,
amoral crackpot!

156
00:13:21,293 --> 00:13:24,808  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant.
- Tally me banana.

157
00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:27,646  X1:193 X2:521 Y1:489 Y2:516
Amy's a klutz from Mars.

158
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:31,084  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:450 Y2:516
- And you've got that brain thing.
- I already did!

159
00:13:31,293 --> 00:13:34,490  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:456 Y2:516
Leela, do you want
to be like us or like Adlai...

160
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:38,328  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:451 Y2:516
...with no severe mental
or social problems whatsoever?

161
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:41,442  X1:134 X2:580 Y1:489 Y2:516
That's the dumbest question ever.

162
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:43,769  X1:257 X2:458 Y1:450 Y2:516
- She's right.
- Daylight come.

163
00:13:44,493 --> 00:13:48,247  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Coming through. Watch your head.
- Help, I'm under attack!

164
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:55,089  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:451 Y2:516
Remember your manners. Forks in
the left pocket, spoons in the right.

165
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:59,081  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:451 Y2:516
Which one of you cutie muffins
gets the spicy squab?

166
00:13:59,293 --> 00:14:00,885  X1:335 X2:381 Y1:495 Y2:516
Me.

167
00:14:01,213 --> 00:14:04,603  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:456 Y2:516
- What do we say when you get something?
- About time!

168
00:14:04,773 --> 00:14:06,684  X1:260 X2:455 Y1:489 Y2:516
That's my boy!

169
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:09,288  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:489 Y2:516
And here's your check. Bam!

170
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:11,921  X1:246 X2:469 Y1:490 Y2:516
I gotta go poopy!

171
00:14:12,093 --> 00:14:15,130  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:455 Y2:516
You should've gone before
it was time to run.

172
00:14:15,293 --> 00:14:16,885  X1:194 X2:520 Y1:490 Y2:516
Go! Through the kitchen!

173
00:14:17,093 --> 00:14:22,121  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:451 Y2:516
You little crooks! If I catch you,
I'm gonna make cutie-muffin gumbo!

174
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:27,048  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:451 Y2:516
Seeing that robot force
children to do his bidding...

175
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:32,207  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:456 Y2:516
...makes me think about kids.
- Us? Me? You? Kids?

176
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:37,043  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:455 Y2:516
It's time to stop living this
<i>vida</i> bachelor <i>loca</i> and have kids.

177
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:42,486  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:451 Y2:516
Oh, Adlai. This is the most
beautiful moment of my life.

178
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:53,329  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:490 Y2:516
Daddy, I want a piggyback ride!

179
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:57,685  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:450 Y2:516
Daddy's tired. Let's just have
another dog pile on Fry.

180
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:05,884  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Tell us a story, Daddy Bender!
- Story!

181
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:10,524  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:451 Y2:516
- All right, fine. Gather around.
- Yeah! Story!

182
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:13,884  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:490 Y2:516
We want to hear this one again.

183
00:15:15,293 --> 00:15:19,047  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>"Bender's Arrest Record</i>,
by the police.

184
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:23,246  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:451 Y2:516
On March 3, at 2 p.m.,
Bender was caught shoplifting."

185
00:15:23,413 --> 00:15:25,881  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:490 Y2:516
Yeah, show us the picture.

186
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:28,888  X1:281 X2:434 Y1:495 Y2:516
There he is!

187
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:31,732  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:489 Y2:516
It's 9:00, you know what that means.

188
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:35,892  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:450 Y2:516
Daddy's sick of looking
at you, so go to bed.

189
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:40,088  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:454 Y2:516
The grownups have to talk.
Come on, Ma.

190
00:15:43,093 --> 00:15:47,132  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:451 Y2:516
Now to figure out how much money
I'm raking in off those kids.

191
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,642  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:456 Y2:516
- I need a calculator.
- You are one.

192
00:15:55,853 --> 00:16:01,485  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:451 Y2:516
I mean a good calculator. Minus the
food, the bunny-rabbit wallpaper...

193
00:16:01,653 --> 00:16:05,362  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:451 Y2:516
I get 1 00 bucks a kid,
and they're costing 1 1 0!

194
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:09,651  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:451 Y2:516
- There goes my cabinets.
- I won't go to another PTA meeting!

195
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:11,690  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:490 Y2:516
The kids have got to go!

196
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:17,291  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Daddy, how do I flush you?
- Just go to bed!

197
00:16:28,573 --> 00:16:31,849  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:451 Y2:516
Doing this jigsaw puzzle
of a pacifier factory...

198
00:16:32,013 --> 00:16:34,481  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:495 Y2:516
...makes me want children even more.

199
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:39,721  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:450 Y2:516
I was thinking. Since we're orphans,
maybe we should adopt a child.

200
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:42,493  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:489 Y2:516
Adoption? Yes, that's acceptable.

201
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:46,652  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's more than acceptable.
It's adequately satisfactory.

202
00:16:51,213 --> 00:16:56,333  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:516
Imperial Dragon restaurant? I've got
a herd of you-know-whats for sale.

203
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:01,006  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:489 Y2:516
Let me check. Oh, aren't you a cutie.

204
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,892  X1:240 X2:474 Y1:490 Y2:516
About 35 pounds.

205
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:05,685  X1:317 X2:399 Y1:495 Y2:516
What?

206
00:17:06,973 --> 00:17:09,533  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:489 Y2:516
Bender, we'd like to adopt a child.

207
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:11,325  X1:236 X2:478 Y1:490 Y2:516
This is the place...

208
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:15,122  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:450 Y2:516
...because Bender's Orphanarium
means discount orphans.

209
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:19,605  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
What do I have to do to send you
home with 1 2 orphans?

210
00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:24,210  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I'm afraid we only want one.
- I'll show you what I got in stock.

211
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:26,131  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:495 Y2:516
I remember this.

212
00:17:26,373 --> 00:17:30,969  X1:155 X2:559 Y1:451 Y2:516
They trot you out, and parents
judge you like a piece of meat.

213
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:33,528  X1:268 X2:448 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I'm Albert.
- Kind of fatty.

214
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:39,091  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:451 Y2:516
Then how about this little number?
Purebred human. No vampire in there.

215
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,363  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:455 Y2:516
If you're strapped for cash,
consider this unit.

216
00:17:44,573 --> 00:17:50,011  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:456 Y2:516
Cursed with a third ear but full of
an emotion I understand is called love.

217
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:53,290  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:490 Y2:516
One time, I did 1 00 jump ropes.

218
00:17:54,013 --> 00:17:56,925  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:455 Y2:516
I can't decide.
We have to think about it.

219
00:17:57,133 --> 00:17:59,772  X1:188 X2:526 Y1:456 Y2:516
Grownups gotta talk now.
Time for bed.

220
00:17:59,973 --> 00:18:04,489  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:450 Y2:516
- But it's 1 0 a.m.
- I said hit the hay!

221
00:18:08,613 --> 00:18:12,128  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:455 Y2:516
- Oh, they're all so adorable.
- Yeah.

222
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:16,651  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's times like this I can
hardly bear to let them go.

223
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:21,763  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:451 Y2:516
Good night, you princes of Maine,
you kings of New New England.

224
00:18:22,253 --> 00:18:25,882  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:450 Y2:516
You're under arrest
for child cruelty, endangerment...

225
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:30,331  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:451 Y2:516
...selling children as food
and faking the weight of livestock.

226
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:33,764  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:451 Y2:516
If you had kids of your own,
you'd understand!

227
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:38,651  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:451 Y2:516
Would it be all right
if we adopted a kid?

228
00:18:38,853 --> 00:18:42,687  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:061 Y2:122
Might as well. They're gonna
rot in the evidence locker.

229
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:45,129  X1:301 X2:414 Y1:495 Y2:516
Nice ear!

230
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:47,762  X1:248 X2:468 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hey, freaky ears!

231
00:18:48,853 --> 00:18:53,881  X1:096 X2:620 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I've made up my mind. Let's adopt her.
- But there's plenty of normal ones.

232
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:57,005  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:451 Y2:516
Come on, she could
really use a mom and dad.

233
00:18:57,213 --> 00:19:01,570  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Ear-face, Ear-face</i>
<i>Sally won the ugly race</i>

234
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:05,129  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:456 Y2:516
They have a point.
She has an ear on her face.

235
00:19:05,373 --> 00:19:10,049  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:451 Y2:516
So what? She may be different,
but she still deserves a good home.

236
00:19:10,253 --> 00:19:14,804  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:516
If you want her, I'll give her
an operation to make her acceptable.

237
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:18,642  X1:153 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:516
She doesn't need an operation.
She's fine this way.

238
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:22,482  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:451 Y2:516
- And you were fine the way you were?
- Damn right I was!

239
00:19:23,573 --> 00:19:27,009  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:451 Y2:516
Shut up, Fry! Look, Adlai,
I'm proud to be different.

240
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:30,245  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:450 Y2:516
I wish I'd realized that
when I was her age.

241
00:19:30,453 --> 00:19:32,444  X1:247 X2:469 Y1:495 Y2:516
I also have a tail.

242
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:36,168  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:451 Y2:516
Take me to the hospital
and put my eye back. Now.

243
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:37,726  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:490 Y2:516
Why should I do that?

244
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:41,852  X1:140 X2:574 Y1:451 Y2:516
By the end of the day,
one of us is gonna have one eye.

245
00:19:43,373 --> 00:19:47,491  X1:161 X2:553 Y1:450 Y2:516
In recognition of Bender's
generous gift of 1 2 orphans...

246
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:50,287  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:490 Y2:516
...and a check for 1 200 wing-wangs...

247
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:56,284  X1:109 X2:605 Y1:451 Y2:516
...I hereby rename this building
the Bender B. Rodriguez Orphanarium!

248
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:03,770  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's good to have
the weird-looking Leela back.

249
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:08,404  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:450 Y2:516
You're a true friend. I guess there's
nothing wrong with being weird.

250
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:11,605  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:450 Y2:516
Leela, there's nothing
wrong with anything.

251
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:13,246  X1:258 X2:457 Y1:489 Y2:516
We'll miss you.

252
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:18,288  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:450 Y2:516
We know robots don't have emotions,
but we drawed you this picture.

253
00:20:18,493 --> 00:20:23,487  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:451 Y2:516
So if you ever miss us, even just
a teeny bit, you can look at it.

254
00:20:23,693 --> 00:20:27,003  X1:220 X2:496 Y1:451 Y2:516
Hey, I smoke a cigar,
not a candy cane.

255
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,366  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hey, what the...?

256
00:20:49,773 --> 00:20:55,405  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:451 Y2:516
Get away! Come on! I just got
all the gum off of there!

257
00:20:55,613 --> 00:20:59,162  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:490 Y2:516
I hate you! I hate you all!
