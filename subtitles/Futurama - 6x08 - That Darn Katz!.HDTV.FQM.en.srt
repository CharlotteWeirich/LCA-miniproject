00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:14,302
Well, yes,
but that's not "revelant."

108
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,171
I'm talking about Earth.

109
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:18,306
Earth's the generator.

111
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:21,109
Suppose this basketball

00:05:23,112 --> 00:05:25,614
To many young men
in the inner city, it is.

114
00:05:25,681 --> 00:05:29,517
As it spins, it's producing
an enormous magnetic field.

115
00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:33,021
If we could use that field
to generate electric current,

116
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:36,391
we could actually harness the
Earth's rotational ener-ener...

(sneezing):
Kerchoo!

119
00:05:40,463 --> 00:05:41,763
Go on.

120
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:44,366
Sorry, I'm super allergic

121
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:46,334
Professor Katz,
would you mind...?

122
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:48,270
Miss Wong, I I mind everything.

123
00:05:48,337 --> 00:05:50,171
(sniffing)

124
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:53,642
You just need to polarize
the Earth's core with a huge...

125
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:56,311

129
00:06:01,384 --> 00:06:03,118
Enough.

130
00:06:03,185 --> 00:06:05,186
The committee members
will now vote yea or nay.

131
00:06:05,254 --> 00:06:06,154
Nay.

132
00:06:06,222 --> 00:06:07,055
Nay.

133
00:06:07,123 --> 00:06:09,224
Hell, nay.

134
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:12,394
The horse says,
"Doctorate denied."

135
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:23,772
It's okay, Amy.

136
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,740
I don't have
a fancy degree either,

137
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:29,511

in the package delivery field.

138

(door opens)

139
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:39,120
Now that I am a full
and equal member of the crew,

140
00:06:39,188 --> 00:06:41,623
I pledge my loyalty,
my perspicacity,

141
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:44,559
and dare I say it,
my friendship.

142
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:46,394
Leela, muzzle that skunk.

143
00:06:46,462 --> 00:06:49,030
We can't stop a meeting for
some cute, fuzzy, little...

144
00:06:49,098 --> 00:06:51,199
(gasps) Hey, look, a kitty cat.

145
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:52,734
(purring) You again?

Get away,

(all cooing over kitty)

150
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:03,211
People, please, I'm
trying to run a business,

151
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,512
so I get to hold kitty.

152
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,047
No, me.

153
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:07,682

154
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,485
Aw, its anus looks

160
00:07:25,334 --> 00:07:27,035
If I had a spray bottle,

161
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:28,536
I'd give him such a spritzing.

162
00:07:28,604 --> 00:07:30,338
I'll tell you one thing...

163
00:07:30,406 --> 00:07:34,209

Aw, you want
your dipey changed?

166
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:41,483
(cute whimpering)

167
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,153
We'll have to watch
its every move.

168
00:07:45,221 --> 00:07:47,188
Powder, please.

169
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:58,900
(trap closes)

170
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,179
Here's my new theory:
That is one adorable cat.

171
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:12,680
I guess I was just jealous.

172
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:15,817
(sniffs) I do miss
being Leela's shnookums.

173
00:08:15,885 --> 00:08:19,254
I'm going to apologize
and hope for a pity pet.

174
00:08:19,321 --> 00:08:21,389
(both gasp) Yes, my lord.

175
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:24,159
Amy and Nibbler are
a "tewwible thweat."

176
00:08:24,226 --> 00:08:27,128
They must be spayed and
neutered, "wespectivewy."

177
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,198
(hisses)

178
00:08:35,196 --> 00:08:37,197
(to Meow Mix jingle):
♪ Meow-meow, meow-meow,
meow-meow, meow-meow ♪

179
00:08:37,264 --> 00:08:40,033
♪ Meow-meow, meow-meow,
meow-meow, meow-meow... ♪

180
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:42,936
(deep, distorted):
♪ Meow-meow, meow-meow. ♪

181
00:08:43,003 --> 00:08:44,070
(glass shatters)

182
00:08:45,373 --> 00:08:46,272
The cat is evil.

183
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,774
We have proof.

184
00:08:47,842 --> 00:08:49,442
It was summoning a saucer.

185
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,145
Of course it wanted
a saucer, you idiot...

186
00:08:52,213 --> 00:08:56,282
a saucer of "dewicious cweam."

187
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,752
You fool, this isn't
about the cream.

188
00:08:58,819 --> 00:09:01,421
It's pwonounced "cweam."

189
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:04,157
I'm petting mine
down to the bone.

190
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:07,160
Just stwoke its fwuffy fur.

191
00:09:07,228 --> 00:09:09,763
Scwatch its fwubby chin.

192
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,665
Fweeble its fwooby pwow.

193
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:15,001
ALL (chanting):
Pet it, pet it...

194
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:17,103
Pet it, pet it...

195
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:19,672
Pet it, pet it...
No, no!

196
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,107
(sneezes)

197
00:09:21,175 --> 00:09:23,243
Pet it, pet it...

198
00:09:33,187 --> 00:09:36,956
NIBBLER: What do cats need
with that much yarn and cobalt?

199
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:38,758
They're doing
something downstairs.

200
00:09:38,826 --> 00:09:40,193
We've got to find out what.

201
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:44,764
Where do you think
you're going, No-cat?

202
00:09:44,832 --> 00:09:46,299
Uh, the basement.

203
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:48,668
I think I left
the air-hockey table on.

204
00:09:48,736 --> 00:09:51,938
Without a cat,
you ain't going nowhere.

205
00:09:52,006 --> 00:09:54,941
Can you at least tell us
what's going on down there?

206
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:57,410
We're certainly not building
something sinister,

207
00:09:57,478 --> 00:09:59,145
if that's what you're implying.

208
00:09:59,213 --> 00:10:00,647
Now, come on, Bender,

209
00:10:00,714 --> 00:10:03,116
something sinister
won't build itself.

210
00:10:06,821 --> 00:10:09,355
Professor Katz'
last name is Katz.

211
00:10:09,423 --> 00:10:11,958
Do you think he has something
to do with these cats?

212
00:10:12,026 --> 00:10:15,195
The conclusion is as
inescapable as it is moronic.

213
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:17,664
I say we pay him a visit,

214
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:18,865
and if he won't talk to us,

215
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:21,835
he'll talk to Smith & Wesson...

216
00:10:21,902 --> 00:10:24,571
or perhaps
Consolidated Head Melter.

217
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,927
Professor Katz,
we want answers.

218
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:52,799
I warn you,
if I have to get cute,

219
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:54,701
it's gonna get ugly.

220
00:10:56,904 --> 00:10:58,872
(Amy gasps)

221
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:00,640
He's dead!
Wait.

222
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,575
What are these
strings on his lap?

223
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:05,578
What the...?

224
00:11:05,646 --> 00:11:06,980
(gasps) He isn't dead.

225
00:11:07,047 --> 00:11:08,882
He's one of those
dog-operated puppets

226
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:11,351
that's been adapted
for use by a cat!

227
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:14,621
So I had my doctorate denied
by that fuzz ball?!

228
00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:17,056
Bad kitty!

229
00:11:28,302 --> 00:11:30,169
(door creaking)

230
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,776
(both gasp)

231
00:11:36,844 --> 00:11:39,279
Amy: They actually built
the planetary ratchet

232
00:11:39,346 --> 00:11:40,680
from my thesis!

233
00:11:40,748 --> 00:11:44,183
(grunting and groaning)

234
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:45,785
(sneezing)

235
00:11:45,853 --> 00:11:47,320
Uh-oh.

236
00:11:47,388 --> 00:11:49,055
What the...?
(gasps)

237
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:54,894
(in Katz' voice): Well, look
what the me dragged in.

238
00:11:54,962 --> 00:11:56,396
You can talk!

239
00:11:56,463 --> 00:11:57,730
<i>You can talk?</i>

240
00:11:57,798 --> 00:11:58,965
How ironic!

241
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:00,833
Two hyper-intelligent beings

242
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:03,102
both pretending to be
simple house pets.

243
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,572
Say, do you know Obliteron?

244
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:08,041
He pretends
to be a hamster, but...

245
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:09,709
Yeah, that's really great.

246
00:12:09,777 --> 00:12:11,110
Could you please tell us
what's going on?!

247
00:12:11,178 --> 00:12:13,146
What? Oh, right.

248
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:16,182
You see, my associates
and I are from the ninth planet

249
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,518
of the star you call Thuban.

250
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:22,155
Long ago, life there was ideal.

251
00:12:22,222 --> 00:12:26,092
<i>The sun provided plenty
of warm, dozy light.</i>

252
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,094
<i>The Chicken-Salmon roamed free.</i>

253
00:12:28,162 --> 00:12:29,596
(munching)

254
00:12:29,663 --> 00:12:32,031
<i>Yet disaster loomed.</i>

255
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:35,201
<i>Our planet's rotation
was gradually slowing.</i>

256
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:37,303
<i>At first, it seemed beneficial.</i>

257
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:39,339
<i>Long dark nights for sleeping,</i>

258
00:12:39,406 --> 00:12:41,975
<i>long sunny days for sleeping.</i>

259
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,876
<i>But then, it got too hot.</i>

260
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:46,579
(mewing)

261
00:12:46,647 --> 00:12:48,114
<i>And too cold.</i>

262
00:12:48,182 --> 00:12:50,883
(purring, shuddering)

263
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:53,953
<i>Our top scientists went
to work.</i>

264
00:12:54,021 --> 00:12:57,290
<i>At last, they located a planet
with the necessary orientation</i>

265
00:12:57,358 --> 00:13:01,661
<i>and magnetic field to harness
its rotational energy.</i>

266
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:02,595
Earth!

267
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:04,163
Indubitably.

268
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:05,665
Although we call it
Blue-Blue Shiny Ball.

269
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:14,207
<i>In the area now known as Egypt,</i>

270
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:17,910
<i>my people constructed a giant,
semi-octahedral antenna</i>

271
00:13:17,978 --> 00:13:20,780
<i>to beam Earth's
rotational energy to Thuban.</i>

272
00:13:20,848 --> 00:13:22,315
<i>Amy:
The Great Pyramid at Giza!</i>

273
00:13:22,383 --> 00:13:23,883
<i>HEAD CAT:
Yes.</i>

274
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:26,152
<i>The Egyptians viewed us
as gods,</i>

275
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,422
<i>but ironically,
that was our downfall.</i>

276
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,358
<i>They pampered us with feasts
most fancy</i>

277
00:13:32,426 --> 00:13:34,260
<i>and vittles most tender.</i>

278
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:36,262
<i>We grew fat and domesticated.</i>

279
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,164
(mews)

280
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:39,999
<i>Thounds of years passed,</i>

281
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:42,669
<i>and our home world was nearing
total destruction.</i>

282
00:13:42,736 --> 00:13:44,904
(pained yowling)

283
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:48,107
MAN:
Shut up!

284
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:49,709
(window slamming)

285
00:13:49,777 --> 00:13:51,077
But the technology

286
00:13:51,145 --> 00:13:52,845
to save our planet was lost.

287
00:13:52,913 --> 00:13:54,514
Lost, that is,

288
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:56,015
until I heard you speak

289
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,784
at Mars University.

290
00:13:57,851 --> 00:13:59,819
So you called my thesis
a fat sack of barf,

291
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:01,487
and then you stole it?

292
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:03,256
Welcome to academia.

293
00:14:03,323 --> 00:14:06,092
He intends to siphon off
Earth's rotational energy!

294
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,994
Earth will come
to a stop, and...

295
00:14:08,062 --> 00:14:10,897
Half of you will cook,
and half of you will freeze.

296
00:14:10,964 --> 00:14:13,900
Earth will be one big McDLT.

297
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:15,768
We just got that commercial
last year.

298
00:14:15,836 --> 00:14:17,837
Oh, yeah, smarty paws?

299
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:19,205
You may have built the ratchet,

300
00:14:19,273 --> 00:14:20,907
but you can't reach the core

301
00:14:20,974 --> 00:14:23,576
without 4,000 miles
of superconducting wire.

302
00:14:23,644 --> 00:14:25,445
(gasps) The ball of yarn!

303
00:14:32,853 --> 00:14:33,820
Quite.

304
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:35,755
Even so, you'd still need

305
00:14:35,823 --> 00:14:37,623
a tremendously powerful
static charge

306
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:39,258
to trigger the process.

307
00:14:39,326 --> 00:14:41,260
Ever had a cat rub up
against you?

308
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:44,230
If you're propositioning me,
I'm not interested.

309
00:14:44,298 --> 00:14:46,132
I'm talking
about the charge generated

310
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,303
when 50,000 felines
rub against a single surface.

311
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,637
Professor?

312
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:56,309
(loud, amplified whirring)

313
00:14:56,376 --> 00:14:58,711
(mewing)

314
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:07,487
(crackling)

315
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:11,057
(whirring and crackling)

316
00:15:13,994 --> 00:15:15,728
(burbling)

317
00:15:15,796 --> 00:15:21,067
(whirring slows)

318
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:22,568
(rumbling)

319
00:15:22,636 --> 00:15:24,337
Soon the world will
come to a stop,

320
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:27,073
and there's nothing
you can do to stop it.

321
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:28,975
The stopping of
the world, that is.

322
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:30,476
It's unstoppable.

323
00:15:30,544 --> 00:15:32,078
(laughs evilly)

324
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:33,513
Excuse me.

325
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,748
(growling)

326
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,641
(all grunting, groaning)

327
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,609
The Earth h h is coming to a st!

328
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:47,545
Keep your eyes
on the kitties and push!

329
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:51,749
(all grunting)

330
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,518
These space cats seem
to be employing some form

331
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,087
of hypnotic hyper-cuteness.

332
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:58,022
Well, two can play at that game.

333
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,623
And one of them is me.

334
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:02,893
(quiet, gentle mewing)

335
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:05,429
Nibbler? Poopsie-doodle?

336
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,064
(Nibbler mews gently)

337
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,100
Mr. Winkles,
Smudge-Smudge.

338
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,634
Quick, dance with each other!

339
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:13,204
(lively folk music plays)

340
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:14,405
ALL:
Aw!

341
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,073
Aw.

342
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,309
Damn, they are good.

343
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,643
(grunting)

344
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,178
(loud rumbling and rattling)

345
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,481
We're coming to a full stop.

346
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:25,216
All cats, to your posts!

347
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:26,717
(grunting)

348
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:29,220
(rumbling stops,
then a screech)

349
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:31,655
(thudding)

350
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:33,324
(creaking)

351
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,526
(thud, clang)

352
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,294
(thudding)

353
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:40,031
<i>Catastrophe Beach Party...
Scene One.</i>

354
00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:42,299
Cue disaster effects
and... action!

355
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,001
(rumbling)

356
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,536
(people screaming)

357
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,271
(glass clinking)

358
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,572
Cut!

359
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,241
That extra looked at the camera.

360
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:51,575
We'll have to do it again.

361
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,310
(rumbling)

362
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:55,179
(grunting)

363
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,681
And now to transfer
your planet's rotational energy

364
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:59,116
to my home world.

365
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,484
(clack)

366
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,019
(rumbling)

367
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,454
(whirring)

368
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,822
(blip)

369
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:11,929
(electronic pulsing)

370
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:20,037
Well, now, this calls
for a celebration.

371
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,239
(can-can music plays)

372
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,279
(grunting and groaning)

373
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:31,882
What's all this cat hair
on my sweater?

374
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,386
Why am I full of sand?

375
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,121
And Tootsie Rolls?

376
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:40,458
You were all under the spell
of those obnoxious space cats!

377
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:43,561
Enjoy being broiled alive
by the sun,

378
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:46,330
and also the dead bird
we've left in your slipper.

379
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,032
(evil laugh)

380
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,167
(hissing)

381
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,603
Quickly! If we turn
the ratchet the other way,

382
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:55,272
perhaps we can restart
the Earth!

383
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,942
(grunting)

384
00:17:58,009 --> 00:17:59,343
HERMES:
It won't turn.

385
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,711
Push harder, Bender!

386
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,346
(grunts) I can't!

387
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,248
You should have called
my cousin, Turner.

388
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,485
(sighs) It's hopeless.

389
00:18:07,552 --> 00:18:09,286
Even in theory,

390
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,288
the device can only apply
force in one direction.

391
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,690
Can someone open a window?

392
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:14,058
It's getting a little warm
in here.

393
00:18:16,394 --> 00:18:18,462
Is that better?

394
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:21,966
(hissing)

395
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,305
Shmeezus, it's hot!

396
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,441
Why'd I have
to invent that awful device?

397
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:33,277
(crying, tears hissing)

398
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:37,148
Amy, technology isn't
intrinsically good or evil.

399
00:18:37,215 --> 00:18:38,482
It's how it's used.

400
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,384
Like the death ray.

401
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,986
Maybe you're right.

402
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:44,088
I guess science has
to keep pushing forward

403
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,489
with the hope that...

404
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,091
(gasps) That's it!

405
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,692
Pushing forward!

406
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,362
Professor, I know how
to restart the Earth!

407
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:52,696
(splutters)

408
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:54,265
You can't suddenly
know something

409
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:56,167
just by assembling
a committee of words.

410
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:57,501
(gasps) That's it!

411
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,437
I'll assemble your committee!

412
00:19:00,505 --> 00:19:02,506
The ratchet won't
turn backwards,

413
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,842
but what if
we kept pushing it forward?

414
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,077
Earth would start turning again!

415
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:09,213
Yes... the wrong direction!

416
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,315
(laughs)

417
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,283
So?

418
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,584
Oh.

419
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,453
Gentlemen, ladies,

420
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:18,989
let's get this globe trotting.

421
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,192
(grunting)

422
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,295
It's working!

423
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:26,263
Just a little faster!

424
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,165
But we're plotzing here!

425
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,400
Then look at Nibbler!

426
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,506
ALL:
Aw!

427
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,309
(grunting)

428
00:19:38,376 --> 00:19:40,778
(whirring in various tones)

429
00:19:43,114 --> 00:19:46,650
(whirring,
tones playing in reverse)

430
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,687
On the whole,
Earth society is worthless.

431
00:19:49,754 --> 00:19:52,423
But they do have these things
called antique rugs

432
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,291
that are great for peeing on.

433
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,526
(rumbling)

434
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,363
(yowling)

435
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,531
(thudding)

436
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,602
(blip)

437
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:07,104
(cheering)

438
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,906
MAN (British accent):
Good show.

439
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,178
And though the world
is now spinning

440
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,914
in the wrong direction,
it's good enough.

441
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,616
Well done, Amy.

442
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:21,885
I'm honored to begrudgingly
present with your Ph.D.

443
00:20:21,953 --> 00:20:24,054
In applied physics.

444
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:26,190
Also, some kind
of sportsmanship award

445
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,259
I had in my glove compartment.

446
00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:31,095
Yay! I'm finally done
with school!

447
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:32,630
How's the job market?

448
00:20:32,697 --> 00:20:34,498
Ruff.

449
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,968
Congratulations,
Dr. Wong!

450
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,270
(cheering)

451
00:20:39,337 --> 00:20:40,738
Congratulations.

452
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:42,573
Permission to come aboard?

453
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,709
Granted, shnookums.

454
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,112
(purring)
