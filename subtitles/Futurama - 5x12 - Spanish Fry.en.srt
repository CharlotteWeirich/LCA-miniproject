I can't believe I'm seeing Bigfoot.
And he's in focus.

303
00:18:56,853 --> 00:19:00,163
Oh, I've waited my
entire life for this moment.

-What?
-What are you doing with that?

305
00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:06,765
You're going to kill
this innocent giganto?

306
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:09,885
Of course not. I'm just gonna
tranquilize him. . .

307
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:12,692
. . .so I can chop off his feet
as proof he exists. . .

308
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:16,084
. . .then dump him
back in the wild. He'll do fine.

309
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:18,767
You'll have to get through me first.

Okay. Nighty-night.

Ah!

Now, leave this gentle Sasquatch,

. . .so I can finally and at long last harvest
this pathetic human's lower horn.

Yeah!

Wait. What am I saying?

If I poach this beast's lower horn,
am I any better. . .

. . .than that ranger
with his demented foot lust?

Yes, but not by enough.

00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:54,526
This human's lower horn
is one of God's creatures.

322
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:59,050
A living thing. And all living
things, large and small--

LRRR: You'll want to retreat
to a safe, 500-meter radius.

330
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:40,364
Well, Fry, it looks like you get
to hold on to your lower horn.

As usual! Whoo!

You ask a passerby for directions...

...only to find he has
no face or something.

Suddenly up ahead, a door in the road.

You swerve, narrowly avoiding
