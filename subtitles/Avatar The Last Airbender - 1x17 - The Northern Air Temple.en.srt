00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:13,596
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:17,675
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:21,988
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,148
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:29,310
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:31,150
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:33,356
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:37,089
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,712
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

Book One: Water | Chapter Seventeen:
The Northern Air Temple

15
00:00:52,487 --> 00:00:59,052
So travelers, the next time you think you hear a strange large bird talking,...

16
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:06,153
...take a closer look, it might not be a giant parrot, but a flying man!

17
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:10,741
A member of a secret group of air walkers who laugh at gravity...

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,380
...and laugh at those bound to the earth by it!

19
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:18,233
Aren't airbender stories the best?

20
00:01:18,323 --> 00:01:21,024
Was it realistic? Is that how it was back then?

21
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:25,297
I laugh at gravity all the time. Haha! Gravity.

22
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:28,179
Jingle, jingle!

23
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,047
Sorry!

24
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,289
Aww. Cheapskates!

25
00:01:35,358 --> 00:01:37,333
Hey thanks for the story!

26
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:40,322
Tell it to the cap, boy!

27
00:01:43,517 --> 00:01:46,258
Much obliged little bat thing!

28
00:01:46,302 --> 00:01:48,598
It means a lot to hear airbender stories.

29
00:01:48,669 --> 00:01:51,931
It must have been hundred years ago your great grandpa met them.

30
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:58,408
What are you prattling about child? Great grand-pappy saw the air walkers last week!

31
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:07,778
Hey, we're almost at the Northern Air Temple!

32
00:02:07,838 --> 00:02:12,230
This is where they had the
championships for sky bison polo.

33
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:14,742
Do you think we'll really find airbenders?

34
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:16,869
You want me to be like you, or totally honest?

35
00:02:16,912 --> 00:02:18,295
Are you saying I'm a liar?

36
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:21,440
I'm saying you're an optimist. Same thing basically.

37
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:24,788
Hey guys, look at this!

38
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:35,342
Huh! They really are airbenders!

39
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:36,935
No, they're not.

40
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:39,960
What do you mean they're not? Those guys are flying!

41
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:43,546
Gliding maybe, but not flying. You can tell by the way they move.

42
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:48,190
They're not airbending. Those people have no spirit.

43
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:56,927
I don't know, Aang. That kid seems pretty spirited!

44
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,837
We better find some solid ground before it finds us!

45
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:24,571
Go Teo! Show that bald kid how it's done!

46
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,313
Hey there! You're pretty good.

47
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:45,468
Yeh, I know. But I can do more than fancy gliding!

48
00:04:00,297 --> 00:04:04,945
Wow! I don't think I can do that! But here's a good one...

49
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:27,704
What do you think?

50
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:29,500
It's great.

51
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:50,098
Hey! You're a real airbender! You must be the Avatar!

52
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:54,013
That's amazing! I, I, I've heard stories about you.

53
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:54,730
Thanks.

54
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:57,304
Wow! This glider chair is incredible!

55
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:02,810
If you think this is good, wait until you see the other stuff my Dad designed.

56
00:05:25,131 --> 00:05:28,806
Yeh, my Dad is the mastermind behind this whole place!

57
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,558
Everything's powered by hot air.

58
00:05:30,582 --> 00:05:33,858
It even pumps hot air currents outside to give us a lift when we're gliding.

59
00:05:33,886 --> 00:05:35,631
This place is unbelievable.

60
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:37,430
Yeh, it's great isn't it?

61
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,717
No, just unbelievable.

62
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:42,274
Aang used to come here a long time ago.

63
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:45,236
I think he's a little shocked it's so... different.

64
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:47,514
So better!

65
00:05:52,262 --> 00:05:56,320
This is supposed to be the history of my people.

66
00:06:10,324 --> 00:06:14,704
I'm sure some parts of the temple are still the same.

67
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:22,295
It's nice to see even one part of the temple that isn't ruined.

68
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:25,296
Look out!

69
00:06:31,602 --> 00:06:36,302
What the doodle! Don't you know enough to stay away from construction sites?

70
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:39,051
We have to make room for the bathhouse!

71
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:42,530
Do you know what you did? You just destroyed something sacred!

72
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:44,308
For a stupid bathhouse!

73
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:47,135
Well, people around here are starting to stink.

74
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:50,289
This whole place stinks!

75
00:06:56,957 --> 00:07:00,629
This is a sacred temple! You can't treat it this way.

76
00:07:00,676 --> 00:07:03,689
I've seen it when the monks were here. I know what it's supposed to be like.

77
00:07:03,726 --> 00:07:07,122
The monks? But you're twelve!

78
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:12,445
Dad, he's the Avatar. He used to come here a hundred years ago.

79
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:14,778
What are you doing? Who said you could be here?

80
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:20,781
Hmmm... doing here... A long time ago, but not a hundred years,...

81
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:24,807
...my people became refugees after a terrible flood.

82
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:31,242
My infant son, Teo, was badly hurt and lost his mother.

83
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,411
I needed somewhere to rebuild and I stumbled across this place.

84
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:39,881
Couldn't believe it! Everywhere pictures of flying people.

85
00:07:39,957 --> 00:07:45,732
But empty! Nobody home! Then I came across these fan like contraptions!

86
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,516
Our gliders.

87
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,892
Yes, little light flying machines. They gave me an idea.

88
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:54,232
Build a new life for my son, in the air!

89
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:59,375
Then everyone would be on equal ground, so to speak!

90
00:07:59,407 --> 00:08:04,259
We're just in the process of improving upon what's already here and after all,...

91
00:08:04,308 --> 00:08:07,191
...isn't that what nature does?

92
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:08,998
Nature knows where to stop.

93
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:10,734
I suppose that's true.

94
00:08:10,784 --> 00:08:16,019
Unfortunately, progress has a way of getting away from us.

95
00:08:16,077 --> 00:08:18,442
Look at the time!

96
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:22,809
Come the pulley system must be oiled before dark.

97
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:26,774
Wait, how can you tell the time from that thing? The notches all look the same.

98
00:08:26,835 --> 00:08:30,618
The candle will tell us. Watch.

99
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:33,518
You put spark powder in the candle!

100
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:40,796
Four flashes, so it's exactly four hours past midday, or, as I call it, four o'candle!

101
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:45,010
If you like that, wait till you see my finger safe knife sharpener!

102
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:48,348
Only took me three tries to get it right!

103
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:51,882
Follow me!

104
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:55,062
Hey Aang, I want to show you something.

105
00:08:55,192 --> 00:08:58,649
I just can't get over it. There's not a single thing that's the same.

106
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:00,063
I don't know about that.

107
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:02,895
The Temple might be different, but the creatures that live here...

108
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:06,918
...are probably direct descendents of the ones that lived here a long time ago.

109
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:11,885
You're right. They're kind of keepers of the temples origins.

110
00:09:11,923 --> 00:09:16,635
Besides, there's one part of the temple that hasn't changed at all.

111
00:09:16,702 --> 00:09:19,528
Hey! It's just like the one in the other Air Temple.

112
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:23,543
Only an airbender can open it... so inside it's completely untouched,...

113
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:28,399
...just the way the monks left it. I've always wondered what it was like in there.

114
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:29,113
Aang?

115
00:09:29,157 --> 00:09:33,487
I'm sorry, this is the last part of temple that the same as it was.

116
00:09:33,535 --> 00:09:36,039
I want it to stay that way.

117
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,024
I completely understand. I just wanted you to know it was here.

118
00:09:40,065 --> 00:09:41,738
Thanks.

119
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:50,709
These lanterns are terrible! I can't see.

120
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:53,289
Why would you want to use fireflies for light?

121
00:09:53,359 --> 00:10:01,012
Hey! Close that up! They'll get loose. Fireflies are a non-flammable light source.

122
00:10:05,848 --> 00:10:09,504
Cover your nose and hold your breath.

123
00:10:09,552 --> 00:10:13,842
Okay, so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room.

124
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:14,724
Wrong.

125
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:20,265
It's filled to the brim with natural gas. Came across it my first time here.

126
00:10:20,326 --> 00:10:23,352
Unfortunately, I was carrying a torch at the time.

127
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,220
Nearly blew myself and the whole place even more sky high.

128
00:10:27,284 --> 00:10:29,880
Thought my eyebrows would never grow back!

129
00:10:29,947 --> 00:10:33,659
Anyway, there's a vital problem that needs solving.

130
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:39,559
From time to time we have gas leaks and they're nearly impossible to find.

131
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,388
So this place is an explosion waiting to happen?

132
00:10:42,469 --> 00:10:49,543
Yes, until I figure out how to locate something I can't see, hear, smell or touch.

133
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:52,546
The wind will carry you. It supports something inside you...

134
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:58,366
...something even lighter than air, and that something takes over when you fly.

135
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:02,948
I've changed my mind. I think I was born without that something.

136
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:05,142
Impossible! Everybody has it.

137
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,252
Spirit.

138
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,539
What?

139
00:11:07,571 --> 00:11:09,381
That's the something you're talking about.

140
00:11:09,431 --> 00:11:12,366
Yeh, I suppose it is.

141
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:14,057
Are you ready?

142
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:16,146
No!

143
00:11:24,715 --> 00:11:27,330
I can't believe I'm flying!

144
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:31,897
Just make sure to keep your mouth closed so you don't swallow a bug!

145
00:11:32,846 --> 00:11:38,018
Teo was right about the air! All I had to do was trust it. Let it carry me.

146
00:11:38,076 --> 00:11:43,644
Even though Teo's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one.

147
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,791
I've been thinking. If you wanna see what's in that room,...

148
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:50,925
...I'd be happy to open the door for you.

149
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:51,945
Great!

150
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,955
Wait! How do I land this thing?

151
00:11:55,011 --> 00:12:03,373
What if I land... eh! Blech! Yech! Bug! Bug! That was a bug!

152
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:09,936
I said don't touch anything!

153
00:12:10,538 --> 00:12:16,899
Oh, don't worry, that experiments old and that egg was just part of last week's lunch.

154
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:19,849
Ugh! Week old egg smell!

155
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,821
Quick! Find that egg!

156
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:27,522
I can't believe I'm finally going to see what's inside.

157
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,294
How could something that's so small you can't even see it make such a big stink!

158
00:12:43,343 --> 00:12:46,091
That's the solution to our problem!

159
00:12:46,143 --> 00:12:47,173
Yeh!

160
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:51,209
If we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up...

161
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:54,442
The gas will mix with the smell of rotten eggs...

162
00:12:54,492 --> 00:12:55,744
Then, if there's a leak...

163
00:12:55,814 --> 00:12:57,685
You smell rotten eggs!

164
00:12:57,729 --> 00:13:01,751
Then you just follow your nose to the place where the smell is coming from...

165
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:04,407
And plug up the hole where the gas is escaping!

166
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:06,888
You're a genius!

167
00:13:07,477 --> 00:13:10,396
Something's wrong I've got to go.

168
00:13:23,326 --> 00:13:25,356
This is a nightmare.

169
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:27,703
You don't understand.

170
00:13:27,728 --> 00:13:31,070
You're making weapons for the Fire Nation!

171
00:13:37,188 --> 00:13:40,727
You make weapons for the Fire Nation!?

172
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,879
Explain all this! Now!

173
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:50,272
It was about a year after we moved here. Fire Nation soldiers found our settlement.

174
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:53,033
You were too young to remember this tale.

175
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:56,427
They were going to destroy everything, burn it to the ground.

176
00:13:56,472 --> 00:14:02,415
I pleaded with them, I begged them to spare us. They asked what I had to offer.

177
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:09,295
I offered... my services. You must understand, I did this for you!

178
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,758
When are they coming?

179
00:14:20,812 --> 00:14:23,999
Soon. Very soon.

180
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:26,493
You can't give them more weapons.

181
00:14:26,551 --> 00:14:31,212
If I don't give them what they want they will destroy this place.

182
00:14:32,276 --> 00:14:37,014
How can I be proud of you when your inventions are being used for murder?

183
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:40,629
I need some time to think.

184
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,940
You need to leave! Go!

185
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:43,922
We're not leaving!

186
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,542
Then hide, quickly!

187
00:14:49,544 --> 00:14:51,552
You know better than to keep me waiting.

188
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:55,624
Give me what you owe us so I can be on my way.

189
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:59,103
Well? Is there a problem?

190
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:02,204
No, right this way.

191
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:05,405
The deal's off!

192
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:06,939
The Avatar!

193
00:15:06,984 --> 00:15:08,658
Aang, don't get involved!

194
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:13,786
If I don't get what I came for the Fire Nation will burn this place to rubble!

195
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,793
Get out of here!

196
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:18,419
You're leaving empty handed!

197
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,233
Then the destruction of this temple will be on your head.

198
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:34,294
This is bad! Very bad!

199
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:38,244
Aang, what are we gonna do? How can we possibly keep them all away?

200
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:41,222
I'll tell ya how. We have something they don't.

201
00:15:41,297 --> 00:15:44,088
Air power! We control the sky.

202
00:15:44,147 --> 00:15:47,940
That' something the Fire Nation can't do. We can win!

203
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:50,347
I want to help.

204
00:15:50,786 --> 00:15:53,852
Good, we'll need it.

205
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:58,014
We finally got the war balloon working, thanks to Sokka.

206
00:15:58,094 --> 00:15:59,572
This boy's a genius!

207
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:01,698
Thank you. You're a genius!

208
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,344
Thank you!

209
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,661
See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it airborne,...

210
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:09,274
...but once you did, it just kept going.

211
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:12,581
You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would escape.

212
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:16,725
So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air?

213
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,826
Ugh, if only we knew.

214
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,939
A lid is actually the answer. If you control the hot air, you control the war balloon.

215
00:16:25,995 --> 00:16:28,708
Hmm. That's actually pretty smart.

216
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,548
Okay, we've got four kinds of bombs. Smoke, slime, fire and...

217
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:38,618
...stink. Never underestimate the power of stink!

218
00:16:43,912 --> 00:16:45,320
They're coming!

219
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:46,559
Are we ready?

220
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:49,552
Yes, but where's Sokka with the war balloon?

221
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,996
We'll have to start without him.

222
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:36,388
Take them out of the sky, now!

223
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,859
We've got'em on the run! We need more slime!

224
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:37,390
Those things are unstoppable!

225
00:19:37,465 --> 00:19:39,297
I think I know how they work.

226
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:42,516
I remember my Dad tinkering with the counterbalancing system.

227
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,555
Something to do with water. Works great, huh?

228
00:19:45,622 --> 00:19:48,115
Water? Can you get me close to one?

229
00:19:48,148 --> 00:19:50,125
No problem!

230
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:31,665
We're out of bombs!

231
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:36,395
Come on, Sokka, where's that war balloon?

232
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:46,920
Hey, why aren't they shooting at us?

233
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,186
The insignia! They think we're on their side!

234
00:20:50,234 --> 00:20:52,316
Then I guess they won't see this coming.

235
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:55,292
Bomb away!

236
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:05,303
Oh no! That was the last one!

237
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,964
Wait a second, you smell that?

238
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:09,355
Rotten eggs!

239
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:13,244
There! That's where the gas is escaping!

240
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:21,093
What are you doing!? That's our fuel source!

241
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:24,061
It's the only bomb we've got!

242
00:21:44,296 --> 00:21:45,862
Look! They're retreating!

243
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:47,499
Yeh!!!

244
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,911
We're going down!

245
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:52,136
No! Sokka! Hold on!

246
00:21:52,192 --> 00:21:54,184
Get ready!

247
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:12,915
You know what? I'm really glad you guys all live here now.

248
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:16,733
It's like the hermit crab, maybe you weren't born here,...

249
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:19,749
...but you found this empty shell and made it your home.

250
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:21,683
And now you protect each other.

251
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:24,541
That means a lot coming from you.

252
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,774
Aang, you were right about air power.

253
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:31,892
As long as we've got the skies we'll have the Fire Nation on the run!

254
00:22:45,403 --> 00:22:51,249
This defeat is the gateway to many victories.

255
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,330
