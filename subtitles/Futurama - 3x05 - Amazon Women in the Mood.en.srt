1
00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:09,369  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:059 Y2:080
Amazon Women in the Mood

2
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:37,721  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:061 Y2:126
People, we got a problem.
Nibbler's been coughing up hairballs.

3
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:40,766  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:061 Y2:088
So has Fry. What's the big deal?

4
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:43,761  X1:242 X2:473 Y1:489 Y2:516
He's got me beat.

5
00:00:43,973 --> 00:00:48,330  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:516
We all love Nibbler, so it's only fair
that we all clean up together.

6
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:52,242  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:061 Y2:121
Still, I propose we make Zoidberg
do it. All in favor?

7
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:54,684  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:061 Y2:087
All opposed?

8
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,164  X1:263 X2:453 Y1:061 Y2:087
All abstaining?

9
00:00:57,533 --> 00:01:00,411  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:061 Y2:087
Dr. Zoidberg, are you okay?

10
00:01:01,093 --> 00:01:02,765  X1:289 X2:426 Y1:494 Y2:516
He's dead.

11
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:05,243  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:061 Y2:087
He always seemed so full of life.

12
00:01:05,453 --> 00:01:10,527  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:061 Y2:121
Laughing, singing, begging for scraps.
And now this!

13
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:15,009  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:490 Y2:516
Why with all the crying?

14
00:01:15,173 --> 00:01:18,131  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:061 Y2:088
So, that's where I left my shell.

15
00:01:19,173 --> 00:01:20,925  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:494 Y2:516
I didn't know it came off.

16
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:24,688  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:061 Y2:126
It was getting a little cramped,
so I molted, why not?

17
00:01:25,573 --> 00:01:29,202  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:451 Y2:516
- The fresh air feels good.
- Stop doing that!

18
00:01:29,893 --> 00:01:33,329  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:061 Y2:127
So long. I'm off to toss
this old shell in the dumpster...

19
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,929  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:061 Y2:126
...and maybe pick up the potato chips
Amy didn't finish.

20
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:40,967  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Those were toenail clippings.
- A feast is a feast.

21
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:46,607  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:061 Y2:088
Hey, that's my cell phone!

22
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:50,969  X1:320 X2:397 Y1:061 Y2:082
Hello?

23
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:56,082  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:061 Y2:082
Hello? Who is this?

24
00:01:56,253 --> 00:01:58,448  X1:320 X2:397 Y1:061 Y2:082
Hello?

25
00:01:59,773 --> 00:02:01,968  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:490 Y2:516
Did you swallow your phone again?

26
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:05,967  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:450 Y2:516
Some guy's been calling and hanging
up 1 0 times a day for a year.

27
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:08,607  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:454 Y2:516
Men who call too much
are the worst, I bet.

28
00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:10,963  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:490 Y2:516
I wish a decent guy would call me.

29
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:16,161  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:451 Y2:516
Not this spleeze-ball who has me
too terrified to answer the phone.

30
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,005  X1:320 X2:397 Y1:495 Y2:516
Hello?

31
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:23,961  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>Hello? Is anyone there?</i>

32
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:25,964  X1:290 X2:425 Y1:490 Y2:516
I love you!

33
00:02:35,093 --> 00:02:40,087  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:490 Y2:516
Why must I be such a coward?

34
00:02:40,253 --> 00:02:43,370  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:455 Y2:516
I'm off to the men's room,
and I need an attendant...

35
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:46,650  X1:175 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:516
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're crying like a woman.

36
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:51,762  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:451 Y2:516
I see myself as a father figure
to some of my more pathetic men.

37
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:54,891  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:489 Y2:516
Kif, old friend, let's rap.

38
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:58,768  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:489 Y2:516
Well, I'm in love with this girl.

39
00:03:00,693 --> 00:03:04,163  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:492 Y2:516
Oh, that's rich! Go on.

40
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:05,726  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:490 Y2:516
I met her a year ago...

41
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:10,364  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:061 Y2:126
...escaping from that cruise ship
you piloted into a black hole.

42
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:14,048  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>Yes, it was in all the papers.</i>

43
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:19,491  X1:306 X2:409 Y1:495 Y2:516
Call me.

44
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:28,651  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I've finished talking.
- Belay that remark!

45
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:33,291  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:456 Y2:516
Your Amy knows my Leela?
I have formed an idea.

46
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:39,003  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
I want to negotiate a double date.
You and me, Kif and Amy.

47
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:40,162  X1:298 X2:420 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>Forget it!</i>

48
00:03:40,373 --> 00:03:44,412  X1:138 X2:575 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Then let the negotiations begin.</i>
<i>I propose we go out on 1 0 dates.</i>

49
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:46,126  X1:245 X2:473 Y1:456 Y2:516
- How about zero?
- Nine.

50
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,289  X1:263 X2:454 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Zero.
- Seven? Eight?

51
00:03:48,493 --> 00:03:52,088  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:455 Y2:516
Please? Kif's the sweetest guy
who ever liked me.

52
00:03:52,293 --> 00:03:55,251  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:455 Y2:516
Five, and that's my final offer.
Four!

53
00:03:55,973 --> 00:03:57,008  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:456 Y2:516
- One.
- Two.

54
00:03:57,213 --> 00:03:58,532  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Half.
- I'll take it.

55
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:02,442  X1:147 X2:576 Y1:456 Y2:516
<i>We'll meet you for part of dinner</i>
<i>and half of a movie.</i>

56
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:20,968  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:516
Sir? I don't go out on many dates.
What if I don't know what to say?

57
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:23,084  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:489 Y2:516
Here's my book of pickup lines.

58
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:27,166  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:451 Y2:516
Say as many as you can,
as fast as you can. Don't stop.

59
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:31,485  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I'll just give her these flowers.
- Wrong, wrong, wrong.

60
00:04:31,653 --> 00:04:36,249  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:450 Y2:516
And what's that? Candy?
Candy's for dorks. Give me that.

61
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:52,927  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Hello, beautiful. I got these for you.
- Thanks.

62
00:04:56,173 --> 00:05:01,167  X1:175 X2:539 Y1:451 Y2:516
Well, well. This looks to be
one disturbingly erotic date.

63
00:05:01,373 --> 00:05:02,522  X1:296 X2:420 Y1:495 Y2:516
Half-date.

64
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,610  X1:244 X2:472 Y1:456 Y2:516
- A bottle of wine.
- Half-bottle.

65
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:07,810  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:456 Y2:516
- And oysters on the half-shell.
- Quarter-shell.

66
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:11,090  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:450 Y2:516
- And I'd like...
- He's not hungry. It's expensive.

67
00:05:11,293 --> 00:05:15,252  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:455 Y2:516
I'd like two steaks, and the ladies
will have sensual salads...

68
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:17,688  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:490 Y2:516
...with low-cal sensual dressing.

69
00:05:31,493 --> 00:05:33,165  X1:285 X2:429 Y1:490 Y2:516
Thank you.

70
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:37,731  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:450 Y2:516
Kif, you haven't said a word
all night.

71
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:39,810  X1:310 X2:404 Y1:495 Y2:516
Well...

72
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,529  X1:322 X2:393 Y1:495 Y2:516
Hello.

73
00:05:42,693 --> 00:05:46,732  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:456 Y2:516
Because I was really hoping
we could talk and stuff.

74
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:54,686  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:489 Y2:516
"If I said you had a beautiful body...

75
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:57,413  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:456 Y2:516
...would you take your pants off
and dance?"

76
00:05:57,573 --> 00:06:00,610  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:456 Y2:516
- What?
- Lieutenant Kroker!

77
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:05,888  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:455 Y2:516
"I find the most erotic part
of a woman is the boobies."

78
00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:11,811  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:451 Y2:516
This half-date is entirely over.
Amy? Conference.

79
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:14,686  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:490 Y2:516
Is there nothing we can do?

80
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:18,448  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:516
There's one way into a woman's heart
and parts beyond.

81
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:20,808  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:490 Y2:516
I speak, of course, of karaoke.

82
00:06:20,973 --> 00:06:24,932  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:455 Y2:516
My years in the Duke Boys' Chorus
will not have been in vain.

83
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,405  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:456 Y2:516
All right, enough lipstick.
Let's storm out.

84
00:06:37,053 --> 00:06:39,567  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:492 Y2:516
Oh, that's so emotional!

85
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,652  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:494 Y2:516
Amateur hour's over.

86
00:06:44,813 --> 00:06:48,249  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:451 Y2:516
Let me show you why they call me
"The Velour Fog."

87
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:49,892  X1:323 X2:393 Y1:495 Y2:516
Hit it.

88
00:07:05,013 --> 00:07:07,846  X1:248 X2:468 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Give us a break.
- He sickens me!

89
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:44,402  X1:227 X2:489 Y1:450 Y2:516
We're going home.
Call us a space taxi.

90
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:47,963  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:450 Y2:516
No need. There's not a
restaurant built I can't fly.

91
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:49,248  X1:245 X2:472 Y1:493 Y2:516
Where to, ladies?

92
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:52,962  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
Please, sir.
Let's just divide up the check, and...

93
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:55,967  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:489 Y2:516
Let's see what this eatery can do.

94
00:08:00,973 --> 00:08:05,012  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:455 Y2:516
She's built like a steak house,
but she handles like a bistro.

95
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:07,650  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:494 Y2:516
She's out of control!

96
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:10,281  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:490 Y2:516
You win again, gravity!

97
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:22,204  X1:159 X2:555 Y1:061 Y2:126
Look! My new shell catalog!
So, let's try some on, already!

98
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:27,411  X1:251 X2:463 Y1:490 Y2:516
Ah, <i>muy macho.</i>

99
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:32,169  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:451 Y2:516
Hey, gringos, here comes El Zoido
to ruin your drinking water!

100
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:33,648  X1:226 X2:488 Y1:493 Y2:516
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

101
00:08:33,853 --> 00:08:36,447  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:492 Y2:516
I'm Mexican, and I find that offensive!

102
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,563  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:495 Y2:516
You Latins are so hot-blooded.

103
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:44,765  X1:162 X2:552 Y1:489 Y2:516
This one's like a summer guy!

104
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:49,927  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
The Planet Express health plan only
covers one kind of replacement shell.

105
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:58,206  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:455 Y2:516
I can't believe Leela and Amy
aren't back.

106
00:08:58,373 --> 00:09:00,682  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:489 Y2:516
I'm gonna call the restaurant.

107
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:05,847  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>has crashed into a planet.</i>

108
00:09:07,053 --> 00:09:09,408  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:456 Y2:516
- We gotta go rescue them!
- I don't know.

109
00:09:09,613 --> 00:09:12,286  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:493 Y2:516
Bender, think of the <i>señoritas</i>!

110
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:13,682  X1:297 X2:421 Y1:495 Y2:516
<i>Vámonos</i>!

111
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:25,729  X1:282 X2:432 Y1:490 Y2:516
So, Amy...

112
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:30,722  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:450 Y2:516
- It's always a line with you.
- What planet is this?

113
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:36,331  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:456 Y2:516
- This whole sector is uncharted.
- It is not. You lost the chart.

114
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:41,653  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:451 Y2:516
Well, nothing to do but repopulate
the human race, just me and you.

115
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:43,485  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:490 Y2:516
And maybe you.

116
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:47,211  X1:288 X2:428 Y1:495 Y2:516
What is it?

117
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:06,365  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Me hear people, but me not see.
- Everybody make mistake.

118
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:11,481  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:451 Y2:516
Well, hello.
I usually don't say this...

119
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:16,602  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:451 Y2:516
...but you are the most beautiful trio
of gigantic ladies I've ever seen.

120
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:23,412  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:456 Y2:516
I find the most erotic part
of a woman is the boo...

121
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,282  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:451 Y2:516
Oh, no.
Any sign of Leela or Amy?

122
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:44,848  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:490 Y2:516
No, but what do you make of this?

123
00:10:45,013 --> 00:10:48,767  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:516
I don't know, but it might have
something to do with this.

124
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:53,765  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:490 Y2:516
Oh, your God!

125
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:58,048  X1:291 X2:424 Y1:495 Y2:516
Move. Go.

126
00:10:58,373 --> 00:11:00,603  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:489 Y2:516
All right. Here's the plan.

127
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:04,928  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:490 Y2:516
What kind of moronic plan is that?

128
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:07,411  X1:320 X2:394 Y1:495 Y2:516
Wow.

129
00:11:12,653 --> 00:11:15,611  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:490 Y2:516
Women go free. Men stay in chains.

130
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:19,442  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:456 Y2:516
We take them to our leader.
She know what do.

131
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:21,132  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:495 Y2:516
A female leader?

132
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,483  X1:269 X2:447 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Fry, shut up!
- Yes, captain.

133
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:26,412  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:490 Y2:516
This capital city, planet Amazonia.

134
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:30,083  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Where are all the men?
- Men die out many year ago.

135
00:11:30,293 --> 00:11:35,686  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516
They were probably nagged to death.
Are you with me, fellas?

136
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:42,044  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:451 Y2:516
Here stadium, where women
basketball teams play.

137
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:46,405  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:456 Y2:516
- No can dunk, but good fundamentals.
- That more fun to watch.

138
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:50,771  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:489 Y2:516
Oh, God, you're killing me.

139
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:52,366  X1:210 X2:505 Y1:489 Y2:516
God, you're killing me!

140
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:57,003  X1:213 X2:501 Y1:456 Y2:516
This our comedy club.
Humor different here.

141
00:11:57,213 --> 00:11:59,124  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:490 Y2:516
It not reinforce stereotypes.

142
00:11:59,293 --> 00:12:03,571  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:456 Y2:516
Comedy come from character,
not abstract craziness.

143
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:06,367  X1:231 X2:483 Y1:490 Y2:516
Translation: boring.

144
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:09,651  X1:234 X2:480 Y1:489 Y2:516
That's a good one.

145
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:14,563  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:451 Y2:516
- This planet sounds better and better.
- I'm already looking for apartments.

146
00:12:16,573 --> 00:12:21,044  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:456 Y2:516
Here live vengeful, all-knowing
leader. She decide men's fates.

147
00:12:21,213 --> 00:12:24,011  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Is she hot?
- Not important. She all-knowing.

148
00:12:24,213 --> 00:12:26,044  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:493 Y2:516
In other words, no.

149
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:42,048  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:451 Y2:516
- All hail Fem-puter.
- All hail Fem-puter!

150
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:47,492  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:451 Y2:516
- You obey a big computer?
- Yes. It appeared at time men die out.

151
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:51,811  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Why did you make it your leader?
- It different kind of politician.

152
00:12:51,973 --> 00:12:53,691  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:490 Y2:516
Not beltway insider.

153
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:58,284  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:451 Y2:516
Fem-puter, we bring offering
of bath beads and scented soaps.

154
00:12:58,493 --> 00:13:04,682  X1:134 X2:587 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Your gift pleases Fem-puter.</i>
<i>Why are there men on her planet?!</i>

155
00:13:04,853 --> 00:13:07,492  X1:195 X2:518 Y1:451 Y2:516
- It was an accident.
<i>- That does not fem-pute.</i>

156
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:12,602  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Fem-puter will return</i>

157
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:20,443  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm through making fun of women.
I want them to help me.

158
00:13:20,653 --> 00:13:22,405  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:490 Y2:516
Should we do something?

159
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:25,006  X1:245 X2:469 Y1:489 Y2:516
There's no hurry.

160
00:13:25,173 --> 00:13:28,290  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:451 Y2:516
Yes. A little tighter.
Tighter.

161
00:13:28,453 --> 00:13:32,526  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:456 Y2:516
Perhaps a hard spanking is in order?
Too hard!

162
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:36,766  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Men strange. You have them?
- I'm afraid so.

163
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:38,406  X1:261 X2:455 Y1:490 Y2:516
What they for?

164
00:13:41,173 --> 00:13:44,210  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:495 Y2:516
You mean snu-snu!

165
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:48,246  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:495 Y2:516
We hear tell men used for snu-snu.

166
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:52,526  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
All we have go on are ancient legend
and subscription to <i>Cosmo.</i>

167
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:55,412  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:493 Y2:516
FYI, I could be used for snu-snu.

168
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:59,361  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:456 Y2:516
Silence! You want die
like last men visit Amazonia?

169
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:02,770  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:451 Y2:516
- What did they die of?
- Crushed pelvises.

170
00:14:03,573 --> 00:14:06,133  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Yes!
- Thank you, Lord in heaven!

171
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:14,565  X1:127 X2:586 Y1:456 Y2:516
<i>After lengthy fem-putations,</i>

- Yeah!

174
00:14:24,253 --> 00:14:25,845  X1:231 X2:486 Y1:490 Y2:516
What are you, gay?

175
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:36,245  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Death to the men!</i>
<i>Death by snu-snu!</i>

176
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:42,451  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:451 Y2:516
- But the snu-snu part will be good.
- Baby, it'll blow your mind.

177
00:14:42,653 --> 00:14:44,245  X1:264 X2:452 Y1:495 Y2:516
Be reasonable.

178
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:48,162  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:451 Y2:516
Sure, men are annoying,
and they wreck their planets.

179
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:53,282  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516
But these men are sort of my friends.
They don't deserve to die.

180

181
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,043  X1:123 X2:591 Y1:489 Y2:516
They make fun women's basketball.

- Yes. They still laugh.

184
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:10,092  X1:111 X2:603 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>- The men must die!</i>
- Too true, Fem-puter. You're so wise.

185
00:15:10,253 --> 00:15:12,289  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:494 Y2:516
Kill 'em all. Good riddance.

186
00:15:12,493 --> 00:15:15,246  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:455 Y2:516

I'm a manbot.

187
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:18,291  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:456 Y2:516
Understandable mistake.
You can let me down.

188
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:23,328  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516

- Sure, but check the crotch. Nothing.

189

192
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:49,570  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:450 Y2:516

00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:54,529  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
You can interface with the fem-puter
and reprogram it.

209
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:58,169  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:451 Y2:516
Maybe you can interface with my ass.
By biting it!

210
00:17:00,093 --> 00:17:02,288  X1:255 X2:460 Y1:489 Y2:516
All right, I'll go.

211
00:17:19,653 --> 00:17:23,043  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:451 Y2:516
- How Tonk look?
- Tonk look good. Me fat.

212
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:27,126  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:490 Y2:516
No, you look good. Tonk fat.

213
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:36,683  X1:160 X2:560 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Intruder! Stay away from</i>
<i>the mighty Fem-puter! Guards!</i>

214
00:17:36,893 --> 00:17:41,205  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:451 Y2:516
Time to override the CPU
and reprogram this fem-puter.

215
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:45,726  X1:256 X2:462 Y1:456 Y2:516
<i>Stop it. Stop it!</i>
<i>Cut that out.</i>

216
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,844  X1:199 X2:515 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>Cease hitting Fem-puter.</i>

217
00:17:49,373 --> 00:17:52,331  X1:222 X2:493 Y1:450 Y2:516
You're no fem-puter,
you're a fembot.

218
00:17:52,493 --> 00:17:57,726  X1:152 X2:562 Y1:455 Y2:516
It's true. I disguised myself
so I could rule the Amazonians.

219
00:17:57,933 --> 00:18:01,687  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:451 Y2:516
- But why?
- Why? Why?

220
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:05,129  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:490 Y2:516
I came here from a faraway planet.

221
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:10,048  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:451 Y2:516
A planet ruled by a chauvinistic
man-puter that was really a manbot.

222
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:13,762  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:456 Y2:516
Have you any idea how it feels
to be a fembot...

223
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:18,449  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:455 Y2:516
...in a manbot's man-puter's world?
- What?

224
00:18:18,653 --> 00:18:24,011  X1:117 X2:597 Y1:450 Y2:516
And now, meddling manbot, there's
the question of what to do with you.

225
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:38,725  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:451 Y2:516
We need rest. The spirit is willing,
but the flesh is spongy and bruised.

226
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:42,243  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:451 Y2:516
- It time snu-snu!
- Can't we just cuddle?

227
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:44,683  X1:331 X2:384 Y1:456 Y2:516
- No!
- Oh.

228
00:18:44,973 --> 00:18:48,329  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:455 Y2:516
We can't wait for Bender.
It's time for a woman's touch.

229
00:18:57,653 --> 00:19:01,328  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:490 Y2:516
Me next snu-snu! Out me way!

230
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:07,205  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:456 Y2:516
Where go beautiful man?
Me want snu-snu!

231
00:19:12,893 --> 00:19:16,329  X1:291 X2:425 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Kif, jump!
- My hero.

232
00:19:19,213 --> 00:19:22,842  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:490 Y2:516
Me not get snu-snu. Get him!

233
00:19:38,413 --> 00:19:42,122  X1:147 X2:567 Y1:451 Y2:516
Mighty Fem-puter!
Small girl steal green kissy-man.

234
00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:45,922  X1:132 X2:582 Y1:456 Y2:516
- We kill her now?
<i>- Come back later. Leave me alone.</i>

235
00:19:46,093 --> 00:19:48,687  X1:265 X2:456 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>Yeah, get lost!</i>

236
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:57,405  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm a scary fem-puter.
Release the prisoners.

237
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:03,131  X1:164 X2:549 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>- And bring gold. Lots of gold.</i>
- Why Fem-puter want gold?

238
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,688  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:495 Y2:516
<i>You heard the man.</i>

239
00:20:07,693 --> 00:20:09,649  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>Come on, give me some of that.</i>

240
00:20:11,773 --> 00:20:17,131  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's how I got my new shell.
It looks just like the one I threw out.

241
00:20:17,293 --> 00:20:22,413  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:456 Y2:516
I found it in the same dumpster,
but this one had a live raccoon in it.

242
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:24,450  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:490 Y2:516
Pretty good story, eh?

243
00:20:24,653 --> 00:20:28,009  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:451 Y2:516
Stick to someone else,
you windy barnacle!

244
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:30,966  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:451 Y2:516
The battle of the sexes
was only resolved...

245
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:35,331  X1:154 X2:566 Y1:451 Y2:516
...when a manbot and a fembot
realized they loved each other.

246
00:20:35,493 --> 00:20:37,802  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:456 Y2:516
By the way, if she calls,
I'm not here.

247
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:42,489  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:456 Y2:516
All I know is, this gold says
that was the best mission ever.

248
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,529  X1:277 X2:439 Y1:451 Y2:516
- It sure was.
- Oh, yeah.

249
00:20:45,693 --> 00:20:48,253  X1:266 X2:450 Y1:495 Y2:516
I had snu-snu.

250
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:53,368  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:451 Y2:516
So, Amy?
What do you want to do now?

00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
