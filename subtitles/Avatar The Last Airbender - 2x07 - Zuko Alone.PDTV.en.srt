1
00:00:00,649 --> 00:00:03,021
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:03,022 --> 00:00:04,895
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:04,896 --> 00:00:07,004
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:08,296
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:13,496
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:17,575
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:21,888
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:25,048
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:29,210
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:31,050
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:36,989
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,612
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:00:45,176 --> 00:00:48,250
Previously on "Avatar"...

15
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:51,750
Please, father, I only had the fire nation's best interest at heart!

16
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:58,345
You will learn respect, and suffering will be your teacher.

17
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,136
We no longer have anything to gain by traveling together.

18
00:01:01,178 --> 00:01:03,718
I need to find my own way.

19
00:01:03,747 --> 00:01:07,409
You're like my sister. My father says she was born lucky.

20
00:01:07,424 --> 00:01:10,984
He says I was lucky to be born. I don't need luck though.

21
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:14,321
I've always had to struggle and fight and that's made me strong.

22
00:01:14,343 --> 00:01:16,371
It's made me who I am.

23
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:21,359
Book Two: Earth
Chapter Seven: Zuko Alone

24
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,400
Come on spider snake eyes?

25
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,173
Haha! Yeah!

26
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:11,950
Could I get some water, a bag of feed, and something hot to eat?

27
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:18,359
Not enough here for a hot meal. I can get you two bags of feed.

28
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:35,025
Hey! You throwing eggs at us stranger?

29
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:35,847
No.

30
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,057
You see who did throw it?

31
00:03:38,062 --> 00:03:40,270
No.

32
00:03:40,297 --> 00:03:42,701
That's your favorite word, no?

33
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:45,025
Egg had to come from somewhere.

34
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:47,835
Maybe a chicken flew over.

35
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:55,043
Thanks for your contribution. The army appreciates your support.

36
00:03:55,053 --> 00:03:56,737
You better leave town.

37
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:00,628
Penalty for staying is a lot steeper than you can afford stranger.

38
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:03,320
Trust me.

39
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:07,383
Those soldiers are supposed to protect us from the fire nation,...

40
00:04:07,398 --> 00:04:10,884
...but they're just a bunch of thugs.

41
00:04:12,428 --> 00:04:15,422
Thanks for not ratting me out.

42
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:24,636
I'll take you to my house and feed your ostrich horse for you. Come on, I owe you.

43
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:39,464
No one can ever sneak up on us.

44
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:41,552
No kidding.

45
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:49,188
You a friend of Lee's?

46
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,070
This guy just stood up to the soldiers!

47
00:04:52,077 --> 00:04:54,994
By the end, he practically had them running away.

48
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,755
Does this guy have a name?

49
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,677
I'm, uh?

50
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:02,186
He doesn't have to say who he is if he doesn't want to, Sela.

51
00:05:02,187 --> 00:05:06,995
Anyone who can hold his own against those bully 'soldiers' is welcome here.

52
00:05:07,003 --> 00:05:10,658
Those men should be ashamed to wear Earth Kingdom uniforms.

53
00:05:10,673 --> 00:05:15,607
The real soldiers are off fighting the war, like Lee's big brother Sen Su.

54
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:19,192
Supper's going to be ready soon. Would you like to stay?

55
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:23,248
I can't. I should be moving on.

56
00:05:23,249 --> 00:05:25,540
Gansu could use some help on the barn.

57
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,967
Why don't you two work for a while, and then we'll eat.

58
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:39,560
You don't seem like you're from around here.

59
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:40,724
Uh-uh.

60
00:05:40,742 --> 00:05:42,266
Where are you from then?

61
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,357
Far away.

62
00:05:43,364 --> 00:05:46,060
Oh. Where're you going?

63
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:50,837
Lee, give it a rest. Stop asking the man personal questions, got it?

64
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:57,668
Ah~ yes? So, how did you get that scar?

65
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:02,462
It's not nice to bother people about things they might not want to talk about.

66
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,150
A man's past is his business.

67
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:27,852
Hey mom, want to see how Azula feeds turtle ducks?

68
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:31,610
Zuko! Why would you do that?

69
00:06:44,592 --> 00:06:48,319
Stupid turtle duck, why'd she do that?

70
00:06:48,355 --> 00:06:51,630
Zuko, that's what mom's are like.

71
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:57,872
If you mess with their babies they'll bite you back.

72
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:10,657
Azula!

73
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:18,423
Watch this.

74
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:23,546
Mom, can you make Zuko play with us? We need equal teams to play a game.

75
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:25,575
I am not cart wheeling.

76
00:07:25,576 --> 00:07:29,582
You won't have to. Cart wheeling's not a game, dumb dumb.

77
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,544
I don't care. I don't want to play with you.

78
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:34,580
We are brother and sister.

79
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,472
It's important for us to spend time together. Don't you think so, mom?

80
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:43,134
Yes darling, I think it's a good idea to play with your sister.

81
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:47,012
Go on now, just for a little while.

82
00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:48,598
Here's the way it goes.

83
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:54,968
Now what you do is try to knock the apple off the other person's head. Like this.

84
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:05,199
See, I told you it would work.

85
00:08:05,204 --> 00:08:08,467
Aw, they're so cute together.

86
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,373
You two are such... ugh!

87
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:12,869
I was just coming to get you.

88
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:17,184
Uncle Iroh sent us a letter from the war front. You're soaking wet.

89
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,753
Girls are crazy!

90
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:28,301
If the city is as magnificent as its wall, Ba Sing Se must be something to behold.

91
00:08:28,302 --> 00:08:36,570
I hope you all may see it someday, if we don't burn it to the ground first.

92
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:41,073
Until then, enjoy these gifts.

93
00:08:41,074 --> 00:08:45,294
For Zuko, a pearl dagger from the general who surrendered...

94
00:08:45,295 --> 00:08:47,825
...when we broke through the outer wall.

95
00:08:47,835 --> 00:08:51,759
Note the inscription and the superior craftsmanship.

96
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,996
"Never give up without a fight."

97
00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:57,647
"And for Azula, a new friend."

98
00:08:57,656 --> 00:09:01,952
"She wears the latest fashion for Earth Kingdom girls."

99
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:04,040
If Uncle doesn't make it back from war,...

100
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,998
...then dad would be next in line to be Fire Lord, wouldn't he?

101
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:12,127
Azula, we don't speak that way. It would be awful if Uncle Iroh didn't return.

102
00:09:12,142 --> 00:09:15,700
And besides, Fire Lord Azulon is a picture of health.

103
00:09:15,707 --> 00:09:19,040
How would you like it if cousin Lu Ten wanted dad to die?

104
00:09:19,056 --> 00:09:21,567
I still think our dad would make a much better Fire Lord...

105
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:25,296
...than his royal tea loving kookiness.

106
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:01,203
You're holding them all wrong.

107
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:12,531
Keep in mind, these are dual swords. Two halves of a single weapon.

108
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,366
Don't think of them as separate, because they're not.

109
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:18,963
They're just two different parts of the same whole.

110
00:10:31,473 --> 00:10:34,284
I think you'd really like my brother Sen Su.

111
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,150
He used to show me stuff like this all the time.

112
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:46,218
Here. This ought to get you through a few meals.

113
00:10:51,706 --> 00:10:53,833
What do you think they want?

114
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,860
Trouble.

115
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:06,963
What do you want, Gow?

116
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:12,633
Just thought someone ought to tell you, your son's battalion got captured.

117
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:14,609
You boys here what the Fire Nation did...

118
00:11:14,613 --> 00:11:17,454
...with their last group of Earth Kingdom prisoners?

119
00:11:17,472 --> 00:11:21,196
Dressed them up in Fire Nation uniforms and put them on the frontline...

120
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:24,732
...unarmed, way I heard it.

121
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:25,961
Then they just watched.

122
00:11:25,962 --> 00:11:28,787
You watch your mouth!

123
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:40,467
Why bother rooting around in the mud with these pigs?

124
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:59,320
Iroh has lost his son. Your cousin Lu Ten did not survive the battle.

125
00:11:59,972 --> 00:12:02,950
What's going to happen to my brother?

126
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:08,735
I'm going to the front. I'm going to find Sen Su and bring him back.

127
00:12:12,822 --> 00:12:16,501
When my dad goes... will you stay?

128
00:12:16,521 --> 00:12:19,781
No. I need to move on.

129
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:23,505
Here. I want you to have this. Read the inscription.

130
00:12:23,506 --> 00:12:25,879
"Made in Earth Kingdom."

131
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:27,669
The other one.

132
00:12:27,683 --> 00:12:31,532
"Never give up without a fight."

133
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:47,242
You waste all your time playing with knives. You're not even good.

134
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:50,734
Put an apple on your head and we'll find out how good I am!

135
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,953
By the way, Uncle's coming home.

136
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,713
Does that mean we won the war?

137
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:59,346
No. It mean's Uncle's a quitter and a loser.

138
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:02,289
What are you talking about? Uncle's not a quitter.

139
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:06,169
Oh yes he is. He found out his son died and he just fell apart.

140
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:09,605
A real general would stay and burn Ba Sing Se to the ground,...

141
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:12,421
...not lose the battle and come home crying.

142
00:13:12,422 --> 00:13:14,712
How do you know what he should do?

143
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:19,591
He's probably just sad his only kid is gone... forever.

144
00:13:19,602 --> 00:13:22,318
Your father has requested an audience with Fire Lord Azulon.

145
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:23,772
Best clothes, hurry up.

146
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:27,521
Fire Lord Azulon. Can't you just call him "Grandfather"?

147
00:13:27,532 --> 00:13:30,397
He's not exactly the powerful Fire Lord he used to be.

148
00:13:30,398 --> 00:13:32,959
Some one will probably end up talking his place soon.

149
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:37,623
Young lady! Not, another, word.

150
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:40,253
What is wrong with that child?

151
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:46,374
And how was it Great Grandfather Sozen managed to win the battle of Han Tui?

152
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,864
Great Grandfather won, because?

153
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:51,915
Because even though his army was outnumbered,...

154
00:13:51,924 --> 00:13:53,959
...he cleverly calculated his advantages.

155
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,183
The enemy was downwind and there was a drought.

156
00:13:56,191 --> 00:13:58,971
Their defenses burned to a crisp in minutes.

157
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:04,033
Correct my dear. Now, won't you show Grandfather the new moves...

158
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:07,243
...you demonstrated to me?

159
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:37,755
She's a true prodigy. Just like her Grandfather for whom she's named.

160
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:39,720
You'll never catch up.

161
00:14:39,736 --> 00:14:43,982
I'd like to demonstrate what I've been learning.

162
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:06,455
I failed.

163
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:10,744
No, I loved watching you. That's who you are Zuko.

164
00:15:10,758 --> 00:15:13,372
Someone who keeps fighting even though it's hard.

165
00:15:13,384 --> 00:15:17,700
Prince Ozai, why are you wasting my time with this pomp?

166
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:22,475
Just tell me what you want. Everyone else go.

167
00:15:24,985 --> 00:15:25,556
What are you?!

168
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:26,668
Shh!

169
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:33,833
Father, you must have realized as I have, that with Lu Ten gone,...

170
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:38,203
...Iroh's bloodline has ended. After his son's death,...

171
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,051
...my brother abandoned the siege at Ba Sing Se,...

172
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:45,002
...and who knows when he will return home?

173
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:49,583
But I am here, father, and my children are alive.

174
00:15:49,593 --> 00:15:51,512
Say what it is you want.

175
00:15:51,523 --> 00:15:55,330
Father, revoke Iroh's birthright.

176
00:15:55,346 --> 00:16:01,030
I am your humble servant, here to serve you and our nation. Use me.

177
00:16:01,037 --> 00:16:07,638
You dare suggest I betray Iroh? My first born?

178
00:16:07,651 --> 00:16:11,598
Directly after the demise of his only beloved son?

179
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:14,402
I think Iroh has suffered enough.

180
00:16:14,415 --> 00:16:20,707
But you, your punishment has scarcely begun!

181
00:16:27,762 --> 00:16:31,584
Dad's going to kill you. Really, he is.

182
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:34,466
Ha ha Azula. Nice try.

183
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,372
Fine, don't believe me, but I heard everything.

184
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:40,584
Grandfather said dad's punishment should fit his crime.

185
00:16:40,595 --> 00:16:46,566
"You must know the pain of losing a first born son, by sacrificing your own!"

186
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:47,601
Liar!

187
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,195
I'm only telling you for your own good.

188
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:54,563
I know, maybe you could find a nice Earth Kingdom family to adopt you.

189
00:16:54,574 --> 00:16:58,667
Stop it, you're lying. Dad would never do that to me.

190
00:16:58,676 --> 00:17:02,799
Your father would never do what to you? What is going on here?

191
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,845
I don't know.

192
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,095
It's time for a talk.

193
00:17:08,749 --> 00:17:12,615
Azula always lies? Azula always lies?

194
00:17:12,627 --> 00:17:15,481
Azula always lies?

195
00:17:18,014 --> 00:17:20,003
You have to help. It's Lee.

196
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:22,552
The thugs from town came back as soon as Gansu left.

197
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:25,427
When they ordered us to give them food, Lee pulled a knife on them.

198
00:17:25,428 --> 00:17:29,225
I don't even know where he got a knife! Then they took him away.

199
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:33,711
They told me if he's old enough to fight, he's old enough to join the army.

200
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:37,408
I know we barely know you, but?

201
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:40,249
I'll get your son back.

202
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:51,529
Hey! There he is! I told you he'd come.

203
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:07,205
Let the kid go.

204
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:12,854
Who do you think you are? Telling us what to do?

205
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:16,476
It doesn't matter who I am, but I know who you are.

206
00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:22,272
You're not soldiers. You're bullies. Freeloaders, abusing your power.

207
00:18:22,273 --> 00:18:26,565
Mostly over women and kids. You don't want Lee in your army.

208
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:31,907
You're sick cowards messing with a family who's already lost one son to the war.

209
00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:37,950
Are you going to let this stranger stand there and insult you like this?

210
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,671
Give him a left! A left!

211
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:32,639
It's not a fist fight.

212
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,056
He's got a left sword, don't he?

213
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,402
Look out!

214
00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:45,397
Behind you!

215
00:20:06,265 --> 00:20:07,251
Mom?

216
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:10,311
Zuko, please, my love, listen to me.

217
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:15,861
Everything I've done, I've done to protect you.

218
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:17,602
Remember this Zuko.

219
00:20:17,614 --> 00:20:24,866
No matter how things may seem to change, never forget who you are.

220
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:35,148
Get up.

221
00:20:58,145 --> 00:21:01,305
Who, who are you?

222
00:21:01,306 --> 00:21:07,332
My name is Zuko. Son of Ursa and Fire Lord Ozai.

223
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:12,380
Prince of the Fire Nation and heir to the throne.

224
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:18,516
Liar! I heard of you. You're not a prince, you're an outcast!

225
00:21:18,523 --> 00:21:23,144
His own father burned and disowned him.

226
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,987
Not a step closer.

227
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,889
It's yours. You should have it.

228
00:21:34,897 --> 00:21:38,173
No, I hate you.

229
00:21:41,238 --> 00:21:46,271
Mom? Mom, mom!

230
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,336
Where's mom?

231
00:21:53,347 --> 00:21:57,671
No one knows. Oh, and last night, Grandpa passed away.

232
00:21:57,672 --> 00:22:03,594
Not funny, Azula. You're sick. And I want my knife back, now.

233
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,676
Who's going to make me? Mom?

234
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:14,221
Where is she?

235
00:22:20,101 --> 00:22:26,139
Azulon, Fire Lord to our nation for 23 years.

236
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,393
You were our fearless leader in the battle of Gar Sai.

237
00:22:30,394 --> 00:22:34,538
Our matchless conqueror of the Hu Sin provinces.

238
00:22:34,552 --> 00:22:43,543
You were father of Iroh. Father of Ozai. Husband of Ila, now passed.

239
00:22:43,554 --> 00:22:52,725
Grandfather of Lu Ten, now passed. Grandfather of Zuko and Azula.

240
00:22:54,684 --> 00:22:56,721
We lay you to rest.

241
00:22:56,732 --> 00:23:05,049
As was your dying wish, you are now succeeded by your second son.

242
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:12,573
Hail Fire Lord Ozai!

243
00:23:32,442 --> 00:23:37,406
