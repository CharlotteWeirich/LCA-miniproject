1
00:00:03,217 --> 00:00:06,902
On the count of three, you will awaken
feeling refreshed, as if

2
00:00:07,332 --> 00:00:12,579
Futurama had never been cancelled by idiots,
then brought back by bigger idiots.

3
00:00:13,127 --> 00:00:14,327
One

4
00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:15,633
Two

5
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,499
Professor, my Fry-fro is all frizzy.

6
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:28,444
Okay.
-Well, that's all.

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,401
Oh also, I'm covered with severe burns.

8
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:33,263
So? What of it?

9
00:00:33,349 --> 00:00:35,959
Well.. Why is... those things?

10
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:38,808
You mean you don't remember?

11
00:00:38,865 --> 00:00:41,667
Nope. Nothing. It's like I passed out in college,

12
00:00:41,747 --> 00:00:44,498
except no one drew magic-marker penises on my forehead.

13
00:00:45,235 --> 00:00:47,122
Well, I suppose it's for the best.

14
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:50,403
Considering the unbearable horrors you've endured.

15
00:00:50,704 --> 00:00:52,404
Let's never speak of it again.

16
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:55,108
It all began a few days ago.

17
00:00:55,686 --> 00:00:59,461
We were interstellar fugitives
on the run from the law.

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,477
Fire all weapons and open a hailing
frequency for my victory yodle.

19
00:01:16,448 --> 00:01:21,948
And so, as you and Leela kissed goodbye
in a tender display of tonguesmanship,

20
00:01:22,453 --> 00:01:25,039
We plunged into a massive wormhole.

21
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:27,486
Never to be seen again.

22
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:33,075
Yeah, we're back.

23
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,318
Sweet coincidence of port-au-prince,
we're back at earth!

24
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:41,550
Of course!
That was the Panama wormhole!

25
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,189
Earth's central channel for shipping!

26
00:01:45,364 --> 00:01:49,911
How humorous.
-Yes, it's sort of a comedy central channel.

27
00:01:50,012 --> 00:01:51,692
And we're on it now!

28
00:01:52,693 --> 00:01:53,793
I get it!

29
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:07,921
We've lost power to the forward gameboy.
Mario not responding!

30
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:09,770
Brace for emergency landing.

31
00:02:10,106 --> 00:02:12,890
Roger that. Activate safety-spheres!

32
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,692
Also mine has airconditioning.

33
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:44,667
Yet thanks to my trusty safety-sphere,
I sublibed with only trivial braindabglid.

34
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:48,484
And the others?
-Right here behind this horrorcloth.

35
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:52,183
Are they dead?
-No, no, no, no. Much worse.

36
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:21,498
Subbed by: Daealis

37
00:03:30,552 --> 00:03:34,193
Move over god!
Prepare for rebirth.

38
00:03:37,155 --> 00:03:38,513
Wrong switch.

39
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:52,648
Come on stem cells, work your
astounding scientific nonsense.

40
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,834
Fetal stem cells? Aren't those controversial?

41
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,782
In your time yes, but nowadays

42
00:03:58,783 --> 00:03:59,772
SHUT UP.

43
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:04,365
Besides, these are adult stem cells,
harvested from perfectly healthy adults

44
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:07,138
Whom I killed for their stem cells.

45
00:04:18,001 --> 00:04:19,264
Hermes Conrad!

46
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,146
O' man, I'm dripping with placenta.
Good thing it's casual friday.

47
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,017
Amy Wong!

48
00:04:32,645 --> 00:04:36,540
Ooh, baby soft!
-Indeed.

49
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,381
Dr. Zoidberg!

50
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:43,995
Hermes, my friend! Let me cut off your
umbilical cord.

51
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:48,873
And the rest!

52
00:04:49,311 --> 00:04:51,134
Hooray! We're back in bussiness.

53
00:04:51,313 --> 00:04:53,475
Over my dead body.

54
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,740
Eh, nevermind.

55
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:02,976
Bender, are the stem cells working?

56
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:11,994
I'm dying. I need mouth-to-ass resuscitation.
-I'm on it!

57
00:05:14,742 --> 00:05:16,265
It's not working!

58
00:05:17,872 --> 00:05:20,773
I die happy knowing you fell for that.

59
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:25,249
His power supply is shut. He's flatlining!

60
00:05:28,309 --> 00:05:30,829
Only one thing can keep him alive.

61
00:05:31,895 --> 00:05:33,080
Possibly this thing.

62
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:42,668
Whoo! I've never felt so energetic.

63
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:48,917
That's because the doomsday device I showed
all up in you puts out 15 gigawatts.

64
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:52,670
That's ten times your recommended...
-Who are you, my warranty?

65
00:06:00,964 --> 00:06:05,172
For god sakes Bender, keep dancing!
Keep whooping it up!

66
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:10,800
You must burn off the doomsday energy
as fast as it's produced,

67
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,181
or it will build to critical levels!

68
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:16,707
You don't mean
-Oh but I do.

69
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:22,145
If you stop partying for a single second,
you'll explode and kill everyone here

70
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:26,552
in a fireball melted gears 
and splattered bones!

71
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:30,708
Sounds like a party, baby! Oh yeah!

72
00:06:32,444 --> 00:06:36,743
Hey speaking of splattered bowels,
can I cook you a romantic dinner tonight, Leela?

73
00:06:37,548 --> 00:06:38,627
Where's Leela?

74
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,929
Is she ok? Why hasn't she 
acknowledged my dinner offer?

75
00:06:45,964 --> 00:06:49,535
Something's wrong! She's not 
responding to my poking stick!

76
00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:54,111
Poke harder, dammit!
-I'm poking as hard as I can!

77
00:06:54,534 --> 00:07:00,750
I'm sorry Fry, but I'm afraid Leela 
is in an irreversible coma.

78
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:20,166
My soulmate is gone. Why should I go on living?

79
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:22,305
Because the pain slowly fades,

80
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,449
but the love is forever.

81
00:07:26,006 --> 00:07:28,985
But what if I forget the 
sweet sound of her voice,

82
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:31,751
or the moist touch 
of her eyeball on my lips?

83
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:36,040
Are you still hung-up on whatshername?
Move on already!

84
00:07:36,775 --> 00:07:39,478
Maybe you're right.
-Maybe I'm always right.

85
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:54,191
Build-a-bot workshop.

86
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:56,460
It's time to start living again.

87
00:08:04,452 --> 00:08:07,117
At least it's something to 
distract me from Leela.

88
00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:12,286
Nah

89
00:08:14,546 --> 00:08:16,223
Now that I like for some reason.

90
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:26,463
I like jelly beans. Do you?
-I sure do honey.

91
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:30,629
Come now Fry, you can't 
live out this sick fantasy.

92
00:08:30,864 --> 00:08:31,967
Not without our help.

93
00:08:33,818 --> 00:08:36,887
These security tapes record 
everything at Planet Express.

94
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,595
Including the ship, shower and urinals.

95
00:08:39,796 --> 00:08:43,130
At yet it still hasn't stop 
the illusive bathroom burglar.

96
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:46,126
Maybe he's just trying
 to feed his family

97
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:52,600
Computer, analyze tapes and and extract
 personality profile of one Turanga Leela.

98
00:08:52,844 --> 00:08:56,581
Analyzing..Analyzing.. Checking my E-Bay bid..

99
00:08:56,923 --> 00:08:58,923
Dammit.
Analysis complete.

100
00:09:01,535 --> 00:09:03,721
Hey, I was nuzling that.

101
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:08,001
Attributes transferred. Shoesize 12. Etc.

102
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:13,909
Brace for an emergency landing!
What? We survived the crash?

103
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,721
Oh Fry!

104
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,790
Party people in the house say...

105
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:24,381
This is wonderful. The last thing
I remember I was dying in an explosion.

106
00:09:24,516 --> 00:09:27,781
Yet here I am in the flesh,
more alive than ever.

107
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:28,835
Alive?

108
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,722
You better tell her, Fry.
-Tell me what?

109
00:09:32,995 --> 00:09:36,010
Anyway, my work is done.
I'm gonna hit the showers.

110
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:43,137
Nibbler. Come give mama a hug.

111
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:47,071
What the.. Bad Nibbler, bad Nibbler!

112
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:51,984
What're you doing, pooperdoodle?
It's me, Leela!

113
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,648
Am I really just a robot?
I mean, I have Leela's memories,

114
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:20,037
her opinion of gazelles - majestic.
her emotions - confused and hurt.

115
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:25,362
I swear, I didn't know this would happen.
The only thing I truly know is

116
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:27,121
I love you.

117
00:10:27,676 --> 00:10:29,881
I mean her.
Wait, help me out here.

118
00:10:42,514 --> 00:10:44,452
Do the Bender, do the Bender.

119
00:10:44,502 --> 00:10:46,964
No thank you.
-I said do it!

120
00:10:47,415 --> 00:10:52,658
The truth is Fry, I still have feelings for you.
but are they really my feelings?

121
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:58,652
Am I just an automaton, or can a machine have
sufficient complexity, legitimately achieve consciousness?

122
00:10:59,122 --> 00:11:00,150
I agree

123
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:04,044
I need some time to figure this out.
Until then, friends?

124
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:05,978
Okay.

125
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:12,299
Listen up disco-dummies!
You just flunked out of Bender's college of
party knowledge.

126
00:11:20,197 --> 00:11:23,560
Do the backdance, do the backdance.

127
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:28,046
Good news, everyone.

128
00:11:28,318 --> 00:11:32,116
I'm going to make one final attempt
to awaken Leela.

129
00:11:33,697 --> 00:11:36,110
After all, there's always hope.

130
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:38,932
Really?
-No, don't get your hopes up.

131
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:42,455
Frankly, she's just a brainless mound of
scabs and puss.

132
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:45,551
I didn't need to hear that.

133
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:47,912
No and you don't need to see this.

134
00:11:50,264 --> 00:12:01,411
Wake up, wake up, wake up...

135
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:07,258
Well, that's it. I'm afraid 
traditional medicine has failed.

136
00:12:08,004 --> 00:12:09,852
No! I refuse to give up!

137
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:14,042
Wake up Leela! 
I... LOVE... YOU!

138
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,552
Fry stop.
She's gone.

139
00:12:16,998 --> 00:12:21,609
Dr. Zoidberg, can you note the time
and declare the patient legally dead?

140
00:12:21,735 --> 00:12:24,631
Can I? That's my speciality!

141
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,876
As you all know, Leela's living will states
that in the event of coma,

142
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:48,470
her body is to be fed to the wild
cyclophage, a highly endangered creature
that eats only cyclopses.

143
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:50,949
Yup, that's what her donor-card says.

144
00:12:54,378 --> 00:12:55,508
Goodbye my love.

145
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:03,876
The beast approaches.

146
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:17,636
Bender cut it out. People are 
trying to have emotions.

147
00:13:18,017 --> 00:13:20,880
You think I wanna party?
I'm sick of partying.

148
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:22,918
Wohoo! More partying!

149
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:33,572
Bender! Shut the hell up!

150
00:13:40,448 --> 00:13:42,354
Bender! Stop shutting the hell up!

151
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:46,966
Oh, right.
Leela's back, as if I care. Woo.

152
00:13:47,466 --> 00:13:48,551
Alright, Leela!

153
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:53,329
Thanks. It's so nice to wake up and see..

154
00:13:57,313 --> 00:13:59,209
Leela!?
-Leela?

155
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:00,984
Leela?
-Leela.

156
00:14:01,236 --> 00:14:05,013
How is this possible? And can you believe
she wore a tanktop to my funeral?

157
00:14:05,162 --> 00:14:06,270
Shut up! We got to get out of here!

158
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,991
No, YOU shut up we got to get out of here.

159
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:30,251
All aboard the party-ship!

160
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:38,230
There's no room for two 
captain's butt's in this chair.

161
00:14:38,365 --> 00:14:42,722
-There would be if you'd taken a spin class
instead of just lounging around in a coma!

162
00:14:54,803 --> 00:14:59,333
This is crazy. It's like I'm looking
at an exact robot duplicate of myself.

163
00:14:59,368 --> 00:15:01,233
That is what you're looking at.
 

164
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:04,152
Oh.How could you do this Fry?

165
00:15:04,187 --> 00:15:06,396
Uh.. Coma.. Sad..

166
00:15:06,517 --> 00:15:09,072
I have to go. This is just too freaky.

167
00:15:10,099 --> 00:15:12,907
Please don't get upset, Leela.
She's nothing like you.

168
00:15:13,331 --> 00:15:15,708
I have to go. This is just too freaky.

169
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:23,719
I need chearing up Bender.

170
00:15:23,863 --> 00:15:26,821
I don't know, you want to 
go out and party tonight?

171
00:15:27,313 --> 00:15:31,563
I hate partying! If only I didn't have
so much cronk in my donkydonk.

172
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,742
Why does everything I date run away?

173
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:41,550
I love Leela, always and forever,
and if I loved robot-Leela too,

174
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:45,486
that's only because she had
so much of the real Leela in her

175
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,542
I thought she loved me too,
but obviously I was wrong as usual.

176
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:52,055
Wrong again.

177
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:53,251
You were right.

178
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,933
Leela? Leela-Leela?
Leela-Leela.

179
00:15:57,395 --> 00:16:01,850
I've been thinking Fry. If I lost you,
I don't think I could stand it either.

180
00:16:02,032 --> 00:16:04,324
I'd propably build 
a copy of you too.

181
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:09,110
As long as robo-Leela's not
a jealous type like me, things will

182
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,412
I'LL KILL YOU YOU SLUTCLOPS!

183
00:16:12,925 --> 00:16:15,514
He's mine!
Back off, missy!

184
00:16:22,743 --> 00:16:24,177
Somebody do something!

185
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:25,772
Here, take this!

186
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:27,592
A gun? Do I really need to..

187
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:32,277
-Shoot her! She's the robot!
-No! Shoot her! She's the human!

188
00:16:32,478 --> 00:16:35,556
But how do I know who's the human
and who's the robot?

189
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:37,907
We just told you!
-Yea you idiot!

190
00:16:37,973 --> 00:16:42,631
Ok. Fine. If you're gonna be like that,
I'm not shooting anyone.

191
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:47,666
Right between the lungs.
Man that was close.

192
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:56,368
I'm a robot too!

193
00:16:56,403 --> 00:17:00,121
Aha! That explains this growth on your driveshaft!

194
00:17:00,156 --> 00:17:02,730
But how is this possible?
-Who knows.

195
00:17:03,091 --> 00:17:08,786
Oh, I do. Allow me to explain what really
happened the day the ship crashed.

196
00:17:16,362 --> 00:17:21,321
I'll protect you Leela. My love is stronger than
the vast majority of explosions.

197
00:17:24,856 --> 00:17:28,449
Fry did infact save Leela, though
at a terrible cost to himself.

198
00:17:29,194 --> 00:17:35,053
I tossed him into the stem cells, but
he just bubbled away like flem on a hot sidewalk.

199
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:40,499
Leela was so distraught, she went all 
Blade Runner and built a duplicate.

200
00:17:40,837 --> 00:17:46,036
Then uploaded Fry's personality from the
urinal surveillance tapes.

201
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:47,678
I sure love Leela.

202
00:17:50,105 --> 00:17:57,066
Alas, in recreating Fry's adorable jelly-belly
she had overstuffed him with copperwadding.

203
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:05,600
The innevitable static discharge electrocuted Leela
And destroyed both of their short-term memories.

204
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:09,285
So that's why I'm so amazed 
by these things I already knew.

205
00:18:09,678 --> 00:18:12,671
What could I do? I hung up Leela
with the other bonebags

206
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,691
and went to procure the final ingredient
for my stem cell brew.

207
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:23,883
Professor, my Fry-fro's all frizzy.

208
00:18:24,453 --> 00:18:28,453
My god, I can't believe I'll never see
that particular Fry again.

209
00:18:32,957 --> 00:18:34,202
Hey where's my shoes?

210
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:37,429
Fry?

211
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:39,112
Oh I'm sorry. I didn't realise
 I was already here.

212
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:43,074
Wait, what's with all the Leelas?
-Trust me, don't ask.

213
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:47,151
Ok dork. Listen, I'm gonna hit the urinal,
maybe talk about myself a little bit..

214
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:50,015
Hang on. It's time to sort things out.

215
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:56,495
The truth is, I love Fry. That Fry.
-And I love Leela. Any Leela.

216
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,227
We're robots and we're in love.
Let's ditch these meatjackets.

217
00:19:03,612 --> 00:19:08,452
Whoa, cool!
Hasta la vista, weener.

218
00:19:09,534 --> 00:19:11,923
We'll be back. For our stuff.

219
00:19:15,285 --> 00:19:16,980
Why did their voices change?

220
00:19:17,162 --> 00:19:20,704
That's the one thing 
we'll never truly understand.

221
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:26,271
Uh, this is a bit awkward. Or is it?
-I'm not sure.

222
00:19:26,306 --> 00:19:28,817
I lost track around the second robot.

223
00:19:28,852 --> 00:19:32,973
Well, you know how I feel.
I waited for you for a thousand years,

224
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:34,789
I can wait a little longer.

225
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:38,262
What a load a mush! I've had it.

226
00:19:41,578 --> 00:19:46,057
He's gonna blow!
-Party, Bender. Party for your life!

227
00:19:46,145 --> 00:19:47,692
No chance high-pants!

228
00:19:48,026 --> 00:19:52,529
 I'd rather die and kill all of you 
than party for one more millisecond!

229
00:19:55,436 --> 00:19:57,949
The cyclops-eater!

230
00:20:11,562 --> 00:20:14,252
Hold on, man! It ain't like that!

231
00:20:26,303 --> 00:20:28,405
Jeesh, what does it take to kill me?

232
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:36,600
Bender, you blew out your excess capacity!
You're cured!

233
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:43,516
Sweet mercy! My hellish nightmare is over!
I never have to party again.

234
00:20:43,728 --> 00:20:45,099
Well, that's that then.

235
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,158
We're back everyone!
-PARTY!! AH!
