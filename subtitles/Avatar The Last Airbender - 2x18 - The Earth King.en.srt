1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Water,

2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,447
Earth,

3
00:00:04,448 --> 00:00:06,197
Fire,

4
00:00:06,198 --> 00:00:08,602
Air

5
00:00:08,603 --> 00:00:13,133
Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.

6
00:00:13,134 --> 00:00:17,259
Then, everything changed
when the fire nation attacked.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,202
Only the avatar, master of all
four elements, could stop them.

8
00:00:22,203 --> 00:00:24,862
But when the world
needed him most, he vanished.

9
00:00:24,863 --> 00:00:29,319
100 years passed, and my brother and i
discovered the new avatar,

10
00:00:29,354 --> 00:00:30,876
an airbender named aang

11
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:33,531
And although his
airbending skills are great

12
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:36,259
He has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,278
But i believe aang
can save the world.

Man: previously on "avatar. "

16
00:00:48,479 --> 00:01:24,063
["Previously on Avatar" sequence includes clips from Appa's Lost Days, City of Walls and Secrets, and Lake Laogai. ]

17
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:37,264
I missed you more than you'll ever know, buddy.

18
00:01:42,611 --> 00:01:46,572
Look, we escaped from the Dai Li, we got Appa back, I'm telling you,

19
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,774
we should go to the Earth King now and tell him our plan. We're on a roll.

20
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:53,334
One good hour after weeks of trouble isn't much of a roll.

21
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:54,780
We can build on it.

22
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,726
If we want to invade the Fire Nation when the eclipse happens, we need the Earth King's support.

23
00:01:58,727 --> 00:02:01,044
What makes you think we'll get it?

24
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:05,751
I don't know if you've noticed, but things don't usually go that smoothly for our little gang.

25
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:09,629
I know, but I've got a good feeling about this. This time will be different.

26
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,238
Sokka, Long Feng is control of the city.

27
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,854
His conspiracy with the Dai Li is too powerful.

28
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:18,191
I think we should just keep flying and leave this horrible place behind us.

29
00:02:18,192 --> 00:02:22,160
I'm with sweetness. I've seen enough of Ba Sing Se,

30
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:24,024
and I can't even see!

31
00:02:25,126 --> 00:02:31,115
But now that we have Appa back, there is nothing stopping us from telling the Earth king the truth about the conspiracy and the war.

32
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:32,904
See, Aang's with me.

33
00:02:32,905 --> 00:02:37,337
It's the whole reason we came here in the first place, we have to try.

34
00:02:37,338 --> 00:02:42,517
Well, I guess if the Earth King knew the truth, things could change.

35
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:49,084
I don't trust the new positive Sokka.
Long Feng brainwashed you, didn't he!

36
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,902
That's probably the Dai Li searching
for us. So?

37
00:02:56,903 --> 00:02:59,449
Let's fly!

38
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:08,444
Can we please buy a new saddle?
Riding bareback is terrifying!

39
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:13,976
There it is. That whole thing is the palace.

40
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:16,154
The Earth King's chambers should be in the center.

41
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:19,954
We have to be careful. Long Feng's probably warned the King that we're coming.

42
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:24,260
Why would you assume that? If you ask me, I think we're just gonna sail right in?.Ahhh!

43
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:26,372
What was that?!

44
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:30,127
Surface to air rocks! More incoming! Ahhh!

45
00:04:23,794 --> 00:04:24,851
Sorry!

46
00:04:33,614 --> 00:04:36,829
Sorry! We just need to get through to see the Earth King.

47
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:32,638
Seriously, we're actually on your guys' side. Sorry.

48
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:43,848
In there.

49
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,689
Toph, which way to the Earth King?

50
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,920
How should I know? I'm still voting that we leave Ba Sing Se.

51
00:06:06,686 --> 00:06:08,961
Burglar!

52
00:06:08,962 --> 00:06:11,111
Sorry, wrong door.

53
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:21,625
You did the right thing, letting the Avatar's bison go free.

54
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:23,509
I don't feel right.

55
00:06:31,686 --> 00:06:33,117
Zuko!

56
00:06:40,438 --> 00:06:44,004
Now that's an impressive door. It's gotta go somewhere.

57
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:57,131
A little warning next time!

58
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:07,614
We need to talk to you!

59
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:10,320
They're here to overthrow you.

60
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:13,304
No, we're on your side. We're here to help.

61
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:14,628
You have to trust us.

62
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:19,484
You invade my palace, lay waste to all my guards, break down my fancy door,

63
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:22,207
and you expect me to trust you?

64
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,610
He has a good point.

65
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:28,150
If you're own my side, then drop your weapons and stand down.

66
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:37,509
See, we're friends, your Earthiness.

67
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:53,078
Detain the assailants.

68
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:58,657
But we dropped our weapons. We're your allies.

69
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:03,108
Make sure the Avatar and his friends never see daylight again.

70
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:06,711
The Avatar? You're the Avatar?

71
00:08:06,712 --> 00:08:08,136
Uh, no, him.

72
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:09,478
Over here.

73
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,717
What does it matter Your Highness? They're enemies of the state.

74
00:08:13,718 --> 00:08:15,748
Perhaps you're right.

75
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:24,329
Though Bosco seems to like him.
I'll hear what he has to say.

76
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:31,613
Well, sir, there is a war going on right now. For the past 100 years, in fact.

77
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:33,723
The Dai Li's kept it secret from you.

78
00:08:33,724 --> 00:08:37,475
It's a conspiracy to control the city, and to control you.

79
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,469
A secret war? That's crazy!

80
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,285
Completely!

81
00:08:42,286 --> 00:08:46,710
Long Feng didn't want us to tell you, so he stole our Sky Bison to blackmail us.

82
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:50,527
And blackmail is the least of his crimes, he brain washed our friend!

83
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:54,792
All lies. I've never even seen a Sky Bison Your Majesty.

84
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:56,893
Frankly, I thought they were extinct.

85
00:08:56,894 --> 00:09:01,302
Your claim is difficult to believe, even from an Avatar.

86
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:06,593
These hooligans are part of an anarchist cell that my agents have been tracking for weeks.

87
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:11,711
If you listen to them, you're playing right into your own destruction.

88
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:15,692
I have to trust my advisor.

89
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:22,234
Wait, I can prove he's lying.

90
00:09:22,235 --> 00:09:27,157
Long Feng said he's never seen a Sky Bison, ask him to lift his robe.

91
00:09:27,158 --> 00:09:29,833
What? I am not disrobing!

92
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:38,265
Right there! Appa bit him.

93
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:40,710
Never met a Sky Bison, huh?

94
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:46,334
That happens to be a large birthmark. Thanks for showing everyone.

95
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,960
Well, I suppose there's no way to prove where those marks came from.

96
00:09:49,961 --> 00:09:51,130
Of course there is!

97
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:59,004
Yup, that pretty much proves it.

98
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:02,565
Yeah! Woo!

99
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:05,506
But it doesn't prove this crazy conspiracy theory.

100
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:07,313
Awww.

101
00:10:07,314 --> 00:10:10,219
Though, I suppose this matter is worth looking into.

102
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,062
Uh, ok, we'll take it. Yeah.

103
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:27,441
You're burning up. You have an intense fever.

104
00:10:27,442 --> 00:10:29,946
This will help cool you down.

105
00:10:29,947 --> 00:10:31,433
So thirsty.

106
00:10:34,196 --> 00:10:40,119
Here's some clean water to drink.
Stay under the blankets, and sweat this out.

107
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:06,795
So, this is what a train is like? I didn't realize it would be this... public.

108
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:10,295
So you've never been outside the upper ring before?

109
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:14,722
I've never been outside of the palace.
Now that's the way to travel.

110
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:19,983
So, may I ask where we're going?

111
00:11:19,984 --> 00:11:22,974
Underneath Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness.

112
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:24,935
To the Dai Li's secret headquarters.

113
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:28,702
You're about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place.

114
00:11:39,883 --> 00:11:40,921
It's gone!

115
00:11:40,922 --> 00:11:46,744
Oh, don't tell me?
That's ok, still got my positive attitude.

116
00:11:46,745 --> 00:11:50,001
The Dai Li must have known we were coming and destroyed the evidence.

117
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:53,775
Hmm. That seems awfully convenient.

118
00:11:53,776 --> 00:11:58,083
Hey, if anything, this proves the conspiracy exists even more.

119
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:01,580
Long Feng was right, this was a waste of time.

120
00:12:01,581 --> 00:12:05,376
If you'll excuse me, I'm going back to the palace.

121
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:09,299
The wall! They'll never be able to cover that up in time!

122
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,765
Oh yeah.

123
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:17,403
If you come with us to the outer wall, we can prove to you that the secret war is real!

124
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,482
No Earth King has ever been to the outer wall.

125
00:12:20,483 --> 00:12:23,540
I don't have anymore time for this nonsense.

126
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:28,686
If you come with us, this time you can ride on Appa.

127
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:32,859
Ahhhh!

128
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,408
First time flying?

129
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:38,301
Its both thrilling and terrifying.

130
00:12:38,302 --> 00:12:40,030
Yeah, I hate it too.

131
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:42,616
I have to be honest with you.

132
00:12:42,617 --> 00:12:47,615
Part of me really hopes that what you are telling me about this war... isn't true.

133
00:12:47,616 --> 00:12:49,636
I wish it wasn't.

134
00:13:10,235 --> 00:13:14,557
It's getting late. Are you planning to retire soon, my Lord?

135
00:13:14,558 --> 00:13:16,457
I'm not tired.

136
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:24,420
Relax, Fire Lord Zuko. Just let go, give into it. Shut your eyes for awhile.

137
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:29,724
No, Fire Lord Zuko! Do not listen to the Blue Dragon.

138
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:34,930
You should get out of here right now. Go! Before it's too late!

139
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:40,439
Sleep now, Fire Lord Zuko.

140
00:13:51,651 --> 00:13:55,682
Sleep, just Like MOTHER!

141
00:13:55,683 --> 00:13:59,965
Zuko, help me!

142
00:14:07,861 --> 00:14:09,488
It's still there!

143
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:12,379
What is that?

144
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:17,779
It's a drill. A giant drill made by the Fire Nation, to break through your walls.

145
00:14:20,482 --> 00:14:24,967
I can't believe I never knew.

146
00:14:24,968 --> 00:14:29,512
I can explain this, Your Majesty.

147
00:14:29,513 --> 00:14:32,938
This is nothing more than... a construction project.

148
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:39,694
Really? Then perhaps you can explain why there's a Fire Nation insignia on your construction project.

149
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:46,156
Well, it's imported of course. You know you can't trust domestic machinery.

150
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:52,924
Surely you don't believe these children, instead of your most loyal attendant?!

151
00:14:59,423 --> 00:15:02,290
Dai Li, arrest Long Feng.

152
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:05,886
I want him to stand trial for crimes against the Earth Kingdom.

153
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:19,876
You can't arrest me. You all need me more than you know!

154
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:24,760
Looks like Long Feng is "long gone"! Ha... Oh,

155
00:15:24,795 --> 00:15:27,763
yeah, I've been waitin' to use that one.

156
00:15:31,745 --> 00:15:35,239
I want to thank you, young heroes for opening my eyes.

157
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,931
All this time, what I thought was a great metropolis,

158
00:15:37,932 --> 00:15:43,689
was merely a city of fools, and that makes me the king fool.

159
00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:48,480
We're at war, with the Fire Nation.

160
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,793
That's why we came to Ba Sing Se, Your Highness.

161
00:15:50,794 --> 00:15:53,408
Because we think you can help us end the war.

162
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:57,182
We don't have much time. There's a comet coming this summer.

163
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:02,341
Its energy will give the fire benders unbelievable strength. They'll be unstoppable.

164
00:16:02,342 --> 00:16:06,693
But there is hope. Before the comet comes, we have a window of opportunity.

165
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:08,627
A solar eclipse is coming.

166
00:16:08,628 --> 00:16:13,832
The sun will be entirely blocked out by the moon, and the fire benders will be helpless.

167
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,689
What are you suggesting, Sokka?

168
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:21,085
That's the day we need to invade the Fire Nation. The Day of Black Sun.

169
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:26,347
I don't know. That would require moving troops out of Ba Sing Se.

170
00:16:26,348 --> 00:16:28,621
We'd be completely vulnerable.

171
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:34,497
You're already vulnerable. The Fire Nation won't stop until Ba Sing Se falls.

172
00:16:34,498 --> 00:16:39,053
You can either sit back and wait for that to happen, or take the offensive,

173
00:16:39,054 --> 00:16:41,535
and give yourself a fighting chance.

174
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:48,099
Very well. You have my support.

175
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,163
Woo! Alright! Good work team!

176
00:16:52,164 --> 00:16:57,841
Your Majesty. I apologize for the interruption.

177
00:16:58,926 --> 00:17:02,463
This is General How, He's the leader of The Council of Five.

178
00:17:02,464 --> 00:17:04,349
My highest- ranking generals.

179
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:10,748
We searched Long Feng's office. I think we found something that will interest everybody.

180
00:17:10,749 --> 00:17:17,792
There are secret files on everyone in Ba Sing Se. Including you kids.

181
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:19,297
Secret files?

182
00:17:19,298 --> 00:17:21,190
Toph Bei Fong.

183
00:17:23,616 --> 00:17:29,507
It's a letter from your mom. You mom's here in the city, and she wants to see you.

184
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:34,504
Long Feng intercepted our letters from home? That's just sad.

185
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:35,473
Aang.

186
00:17:35,474 --> 00:17:40,365
This scroll was attached to the horn of your bison when the Dai Li captured it.

187
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:42,572
It's from the Eastern Air Temple.

188
00:17:42,573 --> 00:17:47,577
Is there a letter for me and Sokka by any chance?

189
00:17:47,578 --> 00:17:50,143
I'm afraid not.

190
00:17:50,144 --> 00:17:52,867
Oh.

191
00:17:52,868 --> 00:17:56,404
But there is an intelligence report that might interest you.

192
00:17:56,405 --> 00:17:59,038
A small fleet of water tribe ships?

193
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,237
What? That could be Dad.

194
00:18:01,238 --> 00:18:06,224
Protecting the mouth of Chameleon Bay, led by Hakoda. It is Dad!

195
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:12,813
You should know this is not a natural sickness.

196
00:18:12,814 --> 00:18:16,076
But that shouldn't stop you from enjoying tea.

197
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:18,361
What, what's happening?

198
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:23,342
You're critical decision, what you did beneath that lake...

199
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:26,798
it was in such conflict with your image of yourself,

200
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:32,180
that you are now at war within your own mind and body.

201
00:18:32,181 --> 00:18:33,655
What's that mean?

202
00:18:37,468 --> 00:18:40,549
You're going through a metamorphosis, my nephew.

203
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:45,987
It will not be a pleasant experience, but when you come out of it,

204
00:18:45,988 --> 00:18:50,190
you will be the beautiful Prince you were always meant to be.

205
00:18:51,975 --> 00:18:56,009
I can't believe it. There's a man living at the Eastern Air Temple.

206
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,379
He says he's a Guru.

207
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,418
What's a Guru? Some kind of poisonous blowfish?

208
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,744
No, a spiritual expert.

209
00:19:02,745 --> 00:19:05,809
He wants to help me take the next step in the Avatar journey.

210
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,576
He says he can teach me to control the Avatar State.

211
00:19:08,577 --> 00:19:11,516
And I can't believe we know where our Dad is now.

212
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:14,669
I know what you mean. My Mom's in the city,

213
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,212
and from her letter it sounds like she finally understands me.

214
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:21,835
This is all such big news. Where do we even start?

215
00:19:21,836 --> 00:19:25,512
I hate to say it, but... we have to split up.

216
00:19:25,513 --> 00:19:29,545
Split up? We just found Appa and got the family back together.

217
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:31,734
Now you want us to separate?

218
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:34,661
You have to meet this Guru, Aang.

219
00:19:34,662 --> 00:19:37,661
If we're gonna invade the Fire Nation, you need to be ready.

220
00:19:37,662 --> 00:19:41,727
Well, if I'm going to the Eastern Air Temple.

221
00:19:41,728 --> 00:19:44,879
Appa and I can drop you at Chameleon Bay to see your Dad.

222
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,411
Someone has to stay here with the Earth King and help him plan for the invasion.

223
00:19:48,412 --> 00:19:49,942
I guess that's me

224
00:19:49,943 --> 00:19:52,961
No Sokka, I know how badly you want to help Dad.

225
00:19:52,962 --> 00:19:55,721
You go to Chameleon Bay, I'll stay here with the king.

226
00:19:55,722 --> 00:20:02,177
You are.. the nicest.. sister.. ever.

227
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:07,280
Easy there, big brother.
Though you're right, I am.

228
00:20:14,136 --> 00:20:17,313
Katara, I need to tell you something.

229
00:20:17,314 --> 00:20:20,416
I've been wanting to say it for a long time.

230
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:21,272
What is it Aang?

231
00:20:21,273 --> 00:20:23,741
Katara, I...

232
00:20:23,742 --> 00:20:27,858
Alright! Who's ready to get going on our little men-only man trip?

233
00:20:29,242 --> 00:20:32,549
Aang and Sokka, I wish you good journey.

234
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:37,272
Ba Sing Se owes you its thanks, and we look forward to your return.

235
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,107
Your Majesty.

236
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:42,522
There are three female warriors here to see you,

237
00:20:42,523 --> 00:20:44,204
they're from the island of Kyoshi.

238
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:45,575
That's Suki!

239
00:20:47,987 --> 00:20:49,169
You know these warriors?

240
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:54,413
Oh yeah. The Kyoshi warriors are a skilled group of fighters, trust worthy too.

241
00:20:54,414 --> 00:20:55,956
They're good friends of ours.

242
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,540
Then we shall welcome them as honored guests.

243
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,721
Wait, Aang.

244
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:11,277
I'm really gonna miss you guys.

245
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:12,790
Me too.
Yeah.

246
00:21:15,698 --> 00:21:20,744
Ahhh! Great! That's enough! Ok, we love each other.

247
00:21:20,745 --> 00:21:22,154
Seriously.

248
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,003
Ahhhh!

249
00:21:58,904 --> 00:22:03,089
You see Aang, a little positive thinking works wonders.

250
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,524
We got the King on our side, we got Long Feng arrested,

251
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:08,663
and when we get back, Suki's waiting for me.

252
00:22:08,664 --> 00:22:14,251
Yeah, girls are waiting for us. Thanks 'positive attitude'.

253
00:22:14,252 --> 00:22:18,866
Everything's gonna work out perfectly, from now on and forever.

254
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:32,975
Dinner. The Council of Five and the military are loyal to the Earth King,

255
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:37,686
but the Dai Li remains loyal to you, Long Feng, sir.

256
00:22:51,516 --> 00:22:56,946
Hello? Mom? Anyone home?

257
00:23:02,928 --> 00:23:06,199
Hey! Who do you think you're dealing with?!

258
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,361
One loud mouth little brat who strayed too far from home.

259
00:23:21,351 --> 00:23:23,065
In our hour of need,

260
00:23:23,066 --> 00:23:26,521
it is with the highest honor that I welcome our esteemed allies,

261
00:23:26,522 --> 00:23:28,098
the Kyoshi warriors.

262
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:32,608
We are the Earth King's humble servants.
