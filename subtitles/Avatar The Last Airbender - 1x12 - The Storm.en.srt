<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:13,496
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:17,575
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:21,888
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:25,048
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:29,210
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:31,050
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:36,989
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,612
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

Book One: Water
Chapter Twelve: The Storm

15
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:14,147
We need you, Aang.

16
00:01:14,217 --> 00:01:17,051
I need you too.

17
00:01:21,758 --> 00:01:24,381
Be careful guys!

18
00:01:24,403 --> 00:01:26,797
Guys?

19
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:28,017
Gyatso?

20
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:30,704
Why did you disappear?

21
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:33,999
I didn't mean to.

22
00:01:37,863 --> 00:01:41,847
We need you, Aang.

23
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:52,643
We need you, Aang. We need you.

24
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:56,208
Huh? Uh... what's going on? Did we get captured again?

25
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,774
It's nothing, I just had a bad dream. Go back to sleep.

26
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,876
Don't have to tell me twice.

27
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:03,204
Are you all right, Aang?

28
00:02:03,285 --> 00:02:04,319
I'm okay.

29
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:08,089
You seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately, you wanna tell me about it?

30
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:09,988
I think I just need some rest.

31
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:13,430
You guys want to hear about my dream?

32
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:17,452
That's ok, I didn't wanna talk about it anyway.

33
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:26,694
Look at those clear skies, buddy! Should be some smooth flying.

34
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:31,126
Well, we better smoothly fly ourselves to a market, cause we're out of food.

35
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:34,630
Guys, wait, this was in my dream, we shouldn't go to the market.

36
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,331
What happened in your dream?

37
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:39,256
Food eats people!

38
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:45,551
Also, Momo could talk. You said some very unkind things.

39
00:02:50,726 --> 00:02:54,161
There is a storm coming. A big one.

40
00:02:54,247 --> 00:02:55,632
You're out of your mind, Uncle.

41
00:02:55,705 --> 00:02:58,644
The weather's perfect. There is not a cloud in sight.

42
00:02:58,731 --> 00:03:01,683
The storm is approaching from the north.

43
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:05,716
I suggest we alter our course and head southwest.

44
00:03:05,797 --> 00:03:09,611
We know the Avatar is traveling northward, so we will do the same.

45
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:12,928
Prince Zuko, consider the safety of the crew.

46
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:16,967
The safety of the crew doesn't matter!

47
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:25,778
Finding the Avatar is far more important than any individual's safety.

48
00:03:27,196 --> 00:03:32,041
He doesn't mean that, he's just all worked up.

49
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,415
Ah, it's good! It's perfect, I'm telling you!

50
00:03:38,503 --> 00:03:41,027
I don't know if I like the sound of that swishing.

51
00:03:41,124 --> 00:03:46,371
Swishing means it's ripe! It's the ripe juices swishing around, eh?

52
00:03:46,447 --> 00:03:49,406
I think it's true, Katara, swishing means it's ripe.

53
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:53,626
I just realized we're out of money anyway.

54
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,397
Out of food and out of money, now what are we supposed to do?

55
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:03,435
You could get a job, smart guy.

56
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:05,037
We shouldn't go out there!

57
00:04:05,105 --> 00:04:08,897
Please, the fish can wait. There's going to be a terrible storm.

58
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:11,602
Ahh, you're crazy! It's a nice day.

59
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:15,820
No clouds, no wind, no nothing, so quit you're naggin' woman.

60
00:04:15,885 --> 00:04:18,581
Maybe we should find some shelter?

61
00:04:18,663 --> 00:04:21,063
Are you kidding? Shelter from what?

62
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:25,091
My joints say there's going to be a storm! A bad one.

63
00:04:25,158 --> 00:04:28,226
Well, it's your joints against my brain.

64
00:04:28,298 --> 00:04:31,995
Then I hope your brain can find someone else to haul that fish, cause I ain't comin!

65
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:36,840
Then I'll find a new fish hauler and pay him double what you get! How do you like that?

66
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,826
I'll go!

67
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:40,517
You're hired!

68
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:43,993
What? You said... get a job' and he's paying double.

69
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,350
Double? Who told ya that nonsense?

70
00:04:52,147 --> 00:04:56,017
Uh! Looks like your uncle was right about the storm after all.

71
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,088
Lucky guess.

72
00:04:57,175 --> 00:05:03,259
Lieutenant, you'd better learn some respect, or I will teach it to you.

73
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:09,955
What do you know about respect? The way you talk to everyone around here,...

74
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,907
...from your hard working crew to your esteemed uncle...

75
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:19,149
...shows you know nothing about respect. You don't care about anyone but yourself!

76
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:26,250
Then again, what should I expect from a spoiled prince?

77
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:30,127
Easy now.

78
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:37,950
Enough! We are all a bit tired from being at sea so long.

79
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:46,033
I'm sure after a bowl of noodles everyone will feel much better.

80
00:05:46,109 --> 00:05:51,291
I don't need your help keeping order on my ship.

81
00:05:57,283 --> 00:06:01,108
Sokka, maybe this isn't such a good idea. Look at the sky.

82
00:06:01,172 --> 00:06:06,135
I said I was gonna do this job. I can't back out just because of some bad weather.

83
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:10,439
The boy with the tattoos has some sense. You should listen to him!

84
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:14,806
Boy with tattoos? Airbender tattoos...

85
00:06:14,885 --> 00:06:19,110
...well I'll be a hogmonkey's uncle! You're the Avatar, ain't ya?

86
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,282
That's right.

87
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:26,158
Well don't be so smiley about it. The Avatar disappeared for a hundred years.

88
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,413
You turned your back on the world!

89
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:32,329
Don't yell at him! Aang would never turn his back on anyone!

90
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:34,497
Oh? He wouldn't, uh?

91
00:06:34,576 --> 00:06:39,907
Then I guess I must have imagined the last hundred years of war and suffering.

92
00:06:39,991 --> 00:06:42,284
Aang is the bravest person I know!

93
00:06:42,372 --> 00:06:46,431
He has done nothing but help people and save lives since I met him.

94
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:54,255
It's not his fault he disappeared, right Aang? Aang? What's wrong?

95
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:56,239
That's right! Keep flyin!

96
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:00,528
You're a horrible old man!

97
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:05,040
Appa, yip! Yip!

98
00:07:05,131 --> 00:07:07,615
Hey, they left without saying goodbye!

99
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:09,844
You're friends ain't too polite, are they?

100
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:11,753
I know! This one time I was...

101
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:15,455
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, get below deck.

102
00:07:33,377 --> 00:07:34,974
I'm sorry for running away.

103
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:38,435
It's ok. That fisherman was way out of line.

104
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:40,448
Actually, he wasn't.

105
00:07:40,505 --> 00:07:43,145
What do you mean?

106
00:07:43,218 --> 00:07:44,726
I don't wanna talk about it.

107
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,721
It has to do with your dream, doesn't it?

108
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:49,304
Talk to me.

109
00:07:49,398 --> 00:07:53,486
Well, it's kind of a long story.

110
00:07:57,522 --> 00:08:01,649
I'm gonna try to get a little fire going.

111
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:08,130
I'll never forget the day the monks told me I was the Avatar.

112
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:11,706
I was playing with some other kids just outside the south wall.

113
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:14,494
I was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter...

114
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:19,432
First, you form a ball. Then you gotta get on quick.

115
00:08:25,212 --> 00:08:27,708
Okay! Here goes!

116
00:08:27,785 --> 00:08:30,286
Quick, get on!

117
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:35,540
You kinda have to balance on it like it's a top.

118
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:37,332
Man, that's hard.

119
00:08:37,428 --> 00:08:39,092
Where'd ya learn that trick, Aang?

120
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,556
I made it up.

121
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:48,581
Aang, come with us. We need to speak with you.

122
00:08:53,305 --> 00:08:54,949
How do you know it's me?

123
00:08:55,029 --> 00:09:03,557
We have known you were the Avatar for some time. Do you remember these?

124
00:09:05,135 --> 00:09:08,052
Those were some of my favorite toys when I was little!

125
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:11,623
You chose them from among thousands of toys, Aang.

126
00:09:11,706 --> 00:09:15,400
The toys you picked were the four Avatar relics.

127
00:09:15,496 --> 00:09:20,810
These items belonged to Avatars past. Your own past lives.

128
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:23,532
I just chose them because they seemed fun.

129
00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:26,532
You chose them because they were familiar.

130
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:31,140
Normally we would have told you of your identity when you turned to sixteen,...

131
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:37,280
...but there are troubling signs, storm clouds are gathering.

132
00:09:37,374 --> 00:09:40,804
I fear that war may be upon us, young Avatar.

133
00:09:40,895 --> 00:09:44,418
We need you, Aang.

134
00:09:50,412 --> 00:09:54,503
I'm sick of taking his orders and I'm tired of chasing his Avatar!

135
00:09:54,592 --> 00:09:57,002
I mean who does Zuko think he is?

136
00:09:57,104 --> 00:09:58,976
Do you really want to know?

137
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:00,831
General Iroh! We were just...

138
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,061
It's ok. May I join you?

139
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,650
Of course, Sir!

140
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:13,839
Try to understand, my nephew is a complicated young man.

141
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,299
He has been through much...

142
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,820
Let me in!

143
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:24,835
Prince Zuko, what's wrong?

144
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:28,031
I want to go into the war chamber, but the guard won't let me pass!

145
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:33,930
You're not missing anything, trust me. These meetings are dreadfully boring.

146
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:35,882
If I'm gonna rule this nation one day,...

147
00:10:35,963 --> 00:10:39,335
...don't you think I need to start learning as much as I can?

148
00:10:39,403 --> 00:10:43,360
Very well. But you must promise not to speak.

149
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,304
These old folks are a bit sensitive, you know.

150
00:10:46,382 --> 00:10:48,897
Thank you uncle!

151
00:10:54,538 --> 00:10:57,864
The Earth Kingdom defenses are concentrated here.

152
00:10:57,955 --> 00:11:02,623
A dangerous battalion of their strongest earthbenders and fiercest warriors,...

153
00:11:02,706 --> 00:11:05,783
...so I am recommending the 41st division.

154
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:08,871
But the 41st is entirely new recruits.

155
00:11:08,954 --> 00:11:12,993
How do you expect them to defeat a powerful Earth Kingdom battalion?

156
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:19,359
I don't. They'll be used as a distraction while we mount an attack from the rear.

157
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:23,085
What better to use as bait then fresh meat?

158
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:25,664
You can't sacrifice an entire division like that!

159
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:32,288
Those soldiers love and defend our nation! How can you betray them?

160
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:37,218
Zuko was right, you see, but it was not his place to speak out,...

161
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,283
...and there were... dire consequences.

162
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:47,921
So you were upset that you were the Avatar? Why wouldn't you be excited about it?

163
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:50,859
Well, I didn't know how to feel about it.

164
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:55,591
All I knew is that after I found out, everything began changing...

165
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,634
Hey, not bad! You guys have been practicing!

166
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:03,006
Not only that, we made up a game you can play with the air scooters!

167
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:05,284
Great!

168
00:12:09,044 --> 00:12:10,292
What's going on?

169
00:12:10,378 --> 00:12:11,559
Now that you're the Avatar,...

170
00:12:11,662 --> 00:12:15,592
...it's kind of an unfair advantage for whichever team you're on.

171
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:21,555
But I'm still the same... nothing's changed. So, what, I can't play?

172
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:23,487
That's the only fair way.

173
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:26,151
Oh, ok.

174
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:28,984
Sorry, Aang.

175
00:12:29,063 --> 00:12:34,659
Okay, now who wants to have Jinju on their team?

176
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:44,585
Very interesting move, young one.

177
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:47,237
What do you mean?

178
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:53,333
Hey!

179
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:59,778
You're playing games with him? The Avatar should be training.

180
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,603
Aang has already trained enough for today.

181
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:08,161
Time is short. Come with me. I must test you on some high level techniques.

182
00:13:08,252 --> 00:13:10,569
No, as long as I am his guardian,...

183
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:18,544
...I will decide when he trains and when he gets his butt kicked at Pai Sho.

184
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:31,415
After Zuko's outburst in the meeting, the Fire Lord became very angry with him.

185
00:13:31,473 --> 00:13:36,514
He said that Prince Zuko's challenge of the general was an act of complete...

186
00:13:36,587 --> 00:13:42,317
...disrespect, and there was only one way to resolve this...

187
00:13:42,411 --> 00:13:45,140
Agni kai. A fire duel.

188
00:13:45,212 --> 00:13:46,790
That's right.

189
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:53,532
Zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid.

190
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:58,630
But Zuko misunderstood. When he turned to face his opponent,...

191
00:13:58,697 --> 00:14:02,389
...he was surprised to see it was not the General.

192
00:14:02,477 --> 00:14:06,040
Zuko had spoken out against a general's plan,...

193
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:09,225
...but by doing so in the Fire Lord's war room,...

194
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,149
...it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected.

195
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:20,295
Zuko would have to duel his own father.

196
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:24,921
Then, just when I was starting to feel better, something worse happened.

197
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:31,079
Aang needs to have freedom and fun. He needs to grow up as a normal boy.

198
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:34,794
Humph! You cannot keep protecting him from his destiny.

199
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:37,470
Gyatso, I know you mean well,...

200
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:41,335
...but you are letting your affection for the boy cloud your judgment.

201
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:45,319
All I want is what is best for him.

202
00:14:45,424 --> 00:14:54,173
But what we need is what's best for the world. You and Aang must be separated.

203
00:14:54,271 --> 00:15:01,460
The Avatar will be sent away to the Eastern Air Temple to complete his training.

204
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:12,631
That's awful, Aang. I don't know what to say.

205
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:14,136
How could they do that to me!

206
00:15:14,207 --> 00:15:17,746
They wanted to take away everything I knew and everyone I loved!

207
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:20,846
Whoa! Hot cinders!

208
00:15:20,955 --> 00:15:23,165
I'm sorry I got so mad.

209
00:15:23,245 --> 00:15:26,464
You have a right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that.

210
00:15:26,538 --> 00:15:31,001
Well, that's not exactly what happened...

211
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:40,562
I was afraid and confused. I didn't know what to do.

212
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:53,176
Aang, I'm not going to let them take you away from me. Aang?

213
00:15:58,622 --> 00:16:02,046
I never saw Gyatso again.

214
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:23,310
Next thing I knew, I was waking up in your arms after you found me in the iceberg.

215
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:25,795
You ran away.

216
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:28,298
And then the Fire Nation attacked our temple.

217
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,773
My people needed me and I wasn't there to help.

218
00:16:30,848 --> 00:16:31,761
You don't know what would've...

219
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:34,484
The world needed me and I wasn't there to help.

220
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:35,345
Aang...

221
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:38,776
The fisherman was right! I did turn my back on the world.

222
00:16:38,852 --> 00:16:40,634
You're being too hard on yourself.

223
00:16:40,705 --> 00:16:44,714
Even if you did run away, I think it was meant to be.

224
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,313
If you had stayed you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders.

225
00:16:48,393 --> 00:16:49,532
You don't know that.

226
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:59,548
I know it's meant to be this way. The world needs you now. You give people hope.

227
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:07,841
When Prince Zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him,...

228
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:11,144
...he begged for mercy...

229
00:17:11,223 --> 00:17:14,789
Please, father, I only had the fire nation's best interest at heart!

230
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:16,715
I'm sorry I spoke out of turn!

231
00:17:16,806 --> 00:17:20,034
You will fight for your honor.

232
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:23,676
I meant you no disrespect. I am your loyal son.

233
00:17:23,764 --> 00:17:26,750
Rise and fight, Prince Zuko!

234
00:17:26,873 --> 00:17:28,534
I won't fight you.

235
00:17:28,636 --> 00:17:36,494
You will learn respect, and suffering will be your teacher.

236
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:39,413
I looked away.

237
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:48,489
I always thought that Prince Zuko was in a training accident...

238
00:17:48,573 --> 00:17:51,241
It was no accident.

239
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:57,192
After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight,...

240
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,771
...Zuko had shown shameful weakness.

241
00:18:00,855 --> 00:18:06,506
As punishment he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar.

242
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:10,372
Only then could he return with his honor.

243
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:13,403
So that's why he's so obsessed.

244
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,492
Capturing the Avatar is the only chance he has of things returning to normal.

245
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:21,266
Things will never return to normal.

246
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:28,747
But the important thing is, the Avatar gives Zuko hope.

247
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:46,068
Help! Oh, please help!

248
00:18:46,132 --> 00:18:47,847
It's ok, you're safe.

249
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,594
But, my husband isn't.

250
00:18:49,656 --> 00:18:52,131
What do you mean? Where's Sokka?

251
00:18:52,195 --> 00:18:55,235
They haven't returned. They should've been back by now,...

252
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:59,691
...and this storm is becoming a typhoon. They're caught out at sea.

253
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:01,207
I'm going to find them.

254
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:02,413
I'm going with you.

255
00:19:02,511 --> 00:19:04,967
I'm staying here!

256
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:10,160
We'll be back soon, I promise.

257
00:19:15,497 --> 00:19:16,536
Where were we hit?

258
00:19:16,618 --> 00:19:17,807
I don't know!

259
00:19:17,892 --> 00:19:19,907
Look!

260
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:23,039
The helmsman!

261
00:19:49,894 --> 00:19:52,616
Where are they?

262
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:56,821
Come on, Appa!

263
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,874
The boat! It's there!

264
00:20:11,631 --> 00:20:12,900
The Avatar!

265
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,814
What do you want to do, Sir?

266
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:19,536
Let him go. We need to get this ship to safety.

267
00:20:19,612 --> 00:20:25,890
Then we must head directly into the eye of the storm.

268
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,986
I'm too young to die!

269
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:37,872
I'm not, but I still don't wanna!

270
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:54,269
Hang on to the rope!

271
00:21:45,412 --> 00:21:47,930
Uncle, I am sorry.

272
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,219
Your apology is accepted.

273
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:15,667
Oh, you're alive! You owe this boy an apology.

274
00:22:15,763 --> 00:22:17,552
He doesn't have to apologize.

275
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:23,271
Mmm, uh, what if instead of an apology I give him a free fish and we call it even?

276
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,161
Actually, I don't eat meat.

277
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:26,724
Fish ain't meat.

278
00:22:26,802 --> 00:22:31,229
Seriously, you're still gonna pay me, right?

279
00:22:31,313 --> 00:22:35,403
Katara, I think you were right before. I'm done dwelling on the past.

280
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,281
Really?

281
00:22:36,345 --> 00:22:40,367
I can't make guesses about how things would have turned out if I hadn't run away.

282
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:42,615
I'm here now and I'm going to make the most of it.

283
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:45,422
I don't think you're gonna have those nightmares anymore.

284
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:50,405
Uh, if you weren't here now, well, I guess I wouldn't be either.

285
00:22:50,493 --> 00:22:55,011
Thank you for saving my life, Avatar.

286
00:22:55,117 --> 00:23:00,180
Do you hear that? It's stopped raining.

287
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,388
Appa!

288
00:23:09,553 --> 00:23:10,811
