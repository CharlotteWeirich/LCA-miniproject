311
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:47,067
MeIllvar's got a spaceship!

312
00:18:47,229 --> 00:18:51,859
Yes! ln mint condition, and you
made me take it out of the package!

313
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:00,179
The Nimbus! We're saved!

314
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:03,307
You're under arrest!
Prepare to be boarded.

315
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,907
So I boarded you, huh?
What happened next?

316
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:08,821
You started this stupid court-martial!

317
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:11,378
If you don't mind,
we're still fighting MeIllvar.

318
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:24,541
One more hit and we're done for!

319
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:27,542
Let's take him out with us.
Do you have a self-destruct code?

320
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:31,827
Like destruct sequence 1 -A, 2-B, 3--

321
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:34,981
Thanks a lot, Takei.
Now everybody knows!

322
00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:41,258
If I can 't have the original cast of
Star Trek, no one will. Prepare to die!

323
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:44,148
Wait! lf they mean that much to you,
why would you kill them?

324
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,584
Because l.... I....

325
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:48,947
I don 't know
what I'd do without them.

326
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:52,146
MeIllvar, you can't let
a TV show be your whole life.

327
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:53,662
You can do anything you want.

328
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:57,026
Look at Walter Koenig.
After Star Trek, he became an actor.

329
00:19:57,189 --> 00:19:59,828
Not just an actor,
but a well-rounded person. . .

330
00:19:59,989 --> 00:20:02,787
. . .with my own friends
and credit cards and keys.

331
00:20:02,949 --> 00:20:06,339
Well, I guess I could move out
of my parent's basement...

332
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:07,942
...maybe get a temp job.

333
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:09,906
Whoa. Whoa! One step at a time.

334
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:14,460
I thank you, Fry. You know,
you and I are of a kind.

335
00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:18,304
In a different reality,
I could have called you "friend. "

336
00:20:18,469 --> 00:20:21,142
Episode 1 0: "Balance of Terror. "

337
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:23,345
More like episode nine, loser!

338
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:26,182
In your face! Victory is mine!

[MELLLVAR LAUGHING]

340
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:33,660
I wonder, my friends, was he really
such an evil energy gas?

341
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:35,740
He did give us eternal youth.

342
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:37,547
24-hour Laundromat.

343
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:41,702
A full assortment of rum,
both spiced and regular.

344
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:43,985
Truly, it was a paradise.

345
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:47,983
And all you had to put up with was
one really annoying Star Trek fan.

Let's get the hell out of here.
