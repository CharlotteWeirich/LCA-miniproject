1
00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:09,244  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:495 Y2:516
A Pharaoh to Remember

2
00:00:32,173 --> 00:00:36,086  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>Up next, daring daylight robbery</i>
<i>at a municipal swimming pool.</i>

3
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:38,244  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:061 Y2:087
This is it! Turn me up!

4
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:42,967  X1:169 X2:554 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>Today, a foul-mouthed bandit</i>
<i>robbed the municipal pool...</i>

5
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:46,364  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:061 Y2:121
<i>... taking the contents</i>
<i>of over three lockers.</i>

6
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:48,808  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:495 Y2:516
More like three lockers and a sink.

7
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:52,409  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:061 Y2:121
- You had something to do with this?
- Of course not!

8
00:00:52,573 --> 00:00:55,690  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:451 Y2:516
Holy Spitz!
He's sporting skintight Speedos.

9
00:00:55,853 --> 00:00:59,846  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:450 Y2:516
- They don't leave much to be imagined.
- On a robot, they do.

10
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:02,004  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:061 Y2:082
<i>One human saw the robber...</i>

11
00:01:02,173 --> 00:01:03,891  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:490 Y2:516
Here we go. Here we go.

12
00:01:04,053 --> 00:01:06,692  X1:227 X2:487 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>... describing him as</i>
<i>a nasty, muscular...</i>

13
00:01:06,853 --> 00:01:08,605  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:490 Y2:516
Make me famous, bighead!

14
00:01:08,773 --> 00:01:10,445  X1:189 X2:524 Y1:495 Y2:516
<i>... Caucasian human male.</i>

15
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:11,932  X1:317 X2:399 Y1:495 Y2:516
What?

16
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:16,051  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:061 Y2:126
What am I going to watch
and drink all day?

17
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:17,726  X1:236 X2:478 Y1:061 Y2:087
This is an outrage!

18
00:01:17,893 --> 00:01:21,852  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:061 Y2:126
Why pull the biggest pool caper
if nobody knows you did it?

19
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:26,086  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Well, there's the material rewards.
- You mean this junk?

20
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:32,045  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:451 Y2:516
All I ever wanted was for people
to remember my name.

21
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:33,282  X1:284 X2:432 Y1:494 Y2:516
It's Bender.

22
00:01:33,453 --> 00:01:39,164  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:061 Y2:126
Why bother remembering anything?
You'll forget it five seconds later.

23
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,766  X1:271 X2:444 Y1:494 Y2:516
It's so unfair.

24
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:44,562  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:451 Y2:516
A debonair robot with a zesty,
in-your-face outlook...

25
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:49,363  X1:130 X2:590 Y1:061 Y2:126
...doomed to obscurity like the rest
of you, especially Leela.

26
00:01:50,453 --> 00:01:54,002  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:061 Y2:121
If I died tomorrow,
no one would even notice.

27
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:02,687  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:061 Y2:122
Boy, I've never seen him so down,
or ever before.

28
00:02:03,413 --> 00:02:06,325  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:490 Y2:516
How does a nobody like me get famous?

29
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:07,972  X1:310 X2:405 Y1:495 Y2:516
I know!

30
00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:13,489  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm stuck, but I haven't given up
hope! Call a soft-news journalist!

31
00:02:13,653 --> 00:02:16,770  X1:241 X2:475 Y1:450 Y2:516
- You're not stuck.
- Shut up!

32
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:27,851  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:456 Y2:516
Hey, everybody, do The Bender!
This move's called The Bender!

33
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:32,052  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:455 Y2:516
This circle's about free expression
not fascist moves!

34
00:02:38,853 --> 00:02:41,686  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:495 Y2:516
A blank wall! Fame is mine!

35
00:02:58,453 --> 00:03:02,128  X1:165 X2:549 Y1:061 Y2:126
No one will forget how I live
or my attitude regarding butt.

36
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:08,772  X1:147 X2:567 Y1:450 Y2:516
All right, ladies. Let's flush
these artist lofts straight to hell!

37
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:14,328  X1:337 X2:379 Y1:495 Y2:516
No!

38
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:31,802  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:494 Y2:516
I'm the first one to work. A new low.

39
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:33,247  X1:300 X2:414 Y1:490 Y2:516
Surprise!

40
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,005  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:490 Y2:516
Happy funeral, Bender!

41
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:37,842  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:490 Y2:516
A surprise funeral, for me?

42
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:40,811  X1:093 X2:621 Y1:489 Y2:516
To show you that you'll be remembered.

43
00:03:40,973 --> 00:03:45,171  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:451 Y2:516
Now, if the deceased will kindly
take his place of honor.

44
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:48,248  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:490 Y2:516
Cushiony! And a minibar!

45
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:58,164  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:456 Y2:516
Dearly beloved, we are here
to remember Bender...

46
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:04,010  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:451 Y2:516
...crushed by a runaway semi
driven by the Incredible Hulk.

47
00:04:04,173 --> 00:04:06,892  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:456 Y2:516
Aw, you knew my favorite
cause of death.

48
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:10,932  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:516
Let's remember the best things
about Bender, in our own way.

49
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:12,412  X1:292 X2:426 Y1:495 Y2:516
Professor?

50
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:20,170  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:451 Y2:516
Your standard bending unit
is made of an iron-osmium alloy.

51
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:25,532  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:451 Y2:516
But Bender was different. Bender
had a.04-percent nickel impurity.

52
00:04:26,293 --> 00:04:28,045  X1:209 X2:507 Y1:494 Y2:516
It's what made me me!

53
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:33,609  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:451 Y2:516
If you needed a package brought
into the country without x-raying...

54
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,412  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:451 Y2:516
...Bender always had
a free body cavity.

55
00:04:36,573 --> 00:04:40,486  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:450 Y2:516
- The professor's was better.
- You're supposed to be dead.

56
00:04:40,653 --> 00:04:43,451  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:451 Y2:516
Say how great I am.
And where's the crying?

57
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:46,764  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:451 Y2:516
You people look like
you're waiting for the bus.

58
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,402  X1:281 X2:436 Y1:490 Y2:516
Who-y-boy?

59
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:05,201  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:516
You're at my funeral, singing about
some dead stiff named Danny-boy?

60
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:07,728  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:490 Y2:516
You really are a massive bonehead!

61
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:10,123  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:455 Y2:516
- I'm expressing sorrow.
- Get lost!

62
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:13,808  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'd say, "Don't quit your day job,"
but you're bad at it too!

63
00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:16,885  X1:210 X2:505 Y1:455 Y2:516
- We're trying our best.
- Your best is an idiot.

64
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:20,602  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:451 Y2:516
Pick it up, people.
So far, it's been crap after crap.

65
00:05:20,773 --> 00:05:23,924  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:493 Y2:516
I croaked. Now, show me some love.

66
00:05:25,373 --> 00:05:30,163  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Bender was a truly special...
- Louder and sadder!

67
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,609  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Bender was a truly special...
- Next!

68
00:05:35,893 --> 00:05:38,248  X1:281 X2:436 Y1:454 Y2:516
- Dear Lord...
- Oh, next!

69
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:47,041  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:450 Y2:516
Surely there's someone here
who knows how great I was.

70
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:49,364  X1:217 X2:498 Y1:493 Y2:516
Yes, there is, Bender.

71
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:52,889  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:451 Y2:516
Bender was a lot of things
to a lot of people.

72
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:57,171  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:451 Y2:516
Looking back, the number-one thing
I can say about him is this:

73
00:05:57,453 --> 00:06:00,172  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:490 Y2:516
Bender was my friend.

74
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,324  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:494 Y2:516
What?! That's it?

75
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:06,771  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:455 Y2:516
Who are you? You're nobody!
This is the worst funeral ever!

76
00:06:08,293 --> 00:06:12,650  X1:132 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:516
I hope you're happy! You've
convinced me life is worth living...

77
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:17,045  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:451 Y2:516
...by showing how bad
my funeral will suck!

78
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:20,927  X1:219 X2:498 Y1:456 Y2:516
I know whose funeral
we'll attend next.

79
00:06:21,093 --> 00:06:22,811  X1:298 X2:417 Y1:490 Y2:516
Oh, stop.

80
00:06:27,573 --> 00:06:29,086  X1:250 X2:465 Y1:490 Y2:516
News, everyone!

81
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:34,486  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:455 Y2:516
Today you're going to O'Cyris Four to
deliver this enormous sandstone block.

82
00:06:34,653 --> 00:06:37,850  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:456 Y2:516
I thought something
looked different in here.

83
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:54,972  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:451 Y2:516
Hi. We have a giant stone to deliver.
Sign here.

84
00:06:57,413 --> 00:07:00,723  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:456 Y2:516
Nice! Much like the 1 0 million
identical stones...

85
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:05,364  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:451 Y2:516
...already used in the future tomb
of our great Pharaoh Hermenthotip.

86
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:07,410  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:489 Y2:516
Impressive. Who'll build it?

87
00:07:07,573 --> 00:07:08,767  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:451 Y2:516
- You.
- Say again?

88
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:13,563  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:451 Y2:516
You are now slaves of the great
Pharaoh Hermenthotip. Guards!

89
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:20,242  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:450 Y2:516
Call it a hunch, but I've got
a bad feeling about this.

90
00:07:32,813 --> 00:07:37,045  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
The bad thing about being a slave is,
they don't pay you or let you go.

91
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:39,568  X1:222 X2:493 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's the only thing
about being a slave.

92
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:43,965  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:451 Y2:516
Attention! You are now possessions
of Pharaoh Hermenthotip...

93
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:48,046  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:456 Y2:516
...bringer of the good aspects
of the annual floods!

94
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:51,330  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:451 Y2:516
This place is like
the ancient Egypt of my day!

95
00:07:51,493 --> 00:07:53,211  X1:206 X2:508 Y1:495 Y2:516
That is no coincidence.

96
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:56,809  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:451 Y2:516
Our people visited your Egypt
thousands of years ago.

97
00:07:56,973 --> 00:08:00,602  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:451 Y2:516
Insane theories: one.
Regular theories: a billion!

98
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:05,369  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:451 Y2:516
We learned much from the Egyptians.
Pyramid building, space travel...

99
00:08:05,573 --> 00:08:10,328  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:456 Y2:516
...and how to prepare our dead
so as to scare Abbott and Costello.

100
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:13,208  X1:263 X2:452 Y1:495 Y2:516
Also Wolfman.

101
00:08:14,773 --> 00:08:18,448  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:451 Y2:516
Look at these swanky tombs!
These people know how to die.

102
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:23,129  X1:102 X2:612 Y1:451 Y2:516
They worked thousands of people to
death making these stupid monuments!

103
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:27,445  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:451 Y2:516
Spend your whole life building
a guy's toe, you'll remember him.

104
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:32,207  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:489 Y2:516
I think I'm gonna like it here.

105
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:36,605  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:061 Y2:126
I noticed your sign.
I thought I'd look into your program.

106
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:38,371  X1:161 X2:553 Y1:061 Y2:087
We make you starve to death.

107
00:08:41,013 --> 00:08:46,087  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:451 Y2:516
One, two, three, pull!
One, two, three, pull!

108
00:08:46,253 --> 00:08:47,891  X1:222 X2:493 Y1:490 Y2:516
Aw, bloody chunder!

109
00:08:48,053 --> 00:08:50,931  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:451 Y2:516
Pick it up, people!
We're enslaved to do a job!

110
00:08:51,093 --> 00:08:53,527  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:493 Y2:516
Master, do we have to count to three?

111
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:56,207  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:455 Y2:516
Couldn't we count to one?
Or one-half?

112
00:08:56,373 --> 00:08:59,888  X1:147 X2:567 Y1:451 Y2:516
Good idea, slave. One-half, pull!
One-half, pull!

113
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:01,281  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:489 Y2:516
Now we're slaving!

114
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,928  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:455 Y2:516
Pharaoh's counting on us!
Work faster! Like this:

115
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:25,252  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:489 Y2:516
That's motivating me?

116
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:29,929  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:450 Y2:516
Don't whip with your arms. The power
comes from your hips. Like this:

117
00:09:32,053 --> 00:09:34,613  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:451 Y2:516
Quit giving the slave drivers
pointers!

118
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:38,812  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Remember who your friends are!
- I'll tell you who I remember!

119
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:42,926  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:489 Y2:516
Enoughsis! Pullutut! What's-His-Name!

120
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:46,529  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:490 Y2:516
He was the greatest of all.

121
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:50,962  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:490 Y2:516
Pharaoh Hermenthotip approaches!

122
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:07,728  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:516
Hurry! Pharaoh's coming!
Get that nose in place! Come on!

123
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:30,681  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:451 Y2:516
Excellent work!
I'm very proud of all you slaves!

124
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:34,486  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>Viva</i> Hermenthotip!

125
00:10:34,653 --> 00:10:37,167  X1:092 X2:623 Y1:490 Y2:516
And now, I have a grand announcement.

126
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,643  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:451 Y2:516
In honor of your achievement,
you're all hereby...

127
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:43,892  X1:337 X2:379 Y1:495 Y2:516
No!

128
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:52,202  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:490 Y2:516
Tell the slaves they can all go...

129
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:55,171  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:451 Y2:516
Go faster? I told them,
but they're lazy.

130
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,131  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:489 Y2:516
No. I mean, they're all free.

131
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:02,172  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:454 Y2:516
- Freeloading off you? I agree.
- No, I...

132
00:11:06,973 --> 00:11:09,328  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:490 Y2:516
Pharaoh Hermenthotip is dead.

133
00:11:10,373 --> 00:11:12,967  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:489 Y2:516
He's whipping angels now.

134
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:26,443  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:456 Y2:516
We commend the body of Hermenthotip
to the abode of the damned.

135
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:28,729  X1:185 X2:529 Y1:490 Y2:516
The damned good-looking.

136
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:32,442  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:451 Y2:516
Pharaoh commanded me
to tell that joke at his funeral.

137
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:38,609  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'll always remember you,
Hermenthotip.

138
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:43,403  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:451 Y2:516
To equip Pharaoh for his journey,
we bury him with his favorite things.

139
00:11:43,573 --> 00:11:45,609  X1:179 X2:535 Y1:495 Y2:516
Such as his heart and liver.

140
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:51,685  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:451 Y2:516
And the many goods he left
in his royal garage.

141
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:58,725  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:451 Y2:516
Also this bag of cats our culture
considers holy.

142
00:12:02,413 --> 00:12:07,533  X1:185 X2:537 Y1:456 Y2:516
<i>Pharaoh, my god-king,</i>
<i>You are cold and deceased</i>

143
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:11,083  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>I used to have him sing</i>

144
00:12:11,253 --> 00:12:13,926  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>P- P-P-Pharaoh and his pets</i>

145
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:20,005  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:456 Y2:516
<i>But the years went by</i>
<i>And Pharaoh died</i>

146
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:23,483  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:456 Y2:516
<i>Susie will have joined him</i>
<i>In the afterlife</i>

147
00:12:25,573 --> 00:12:31,091  X1:120 X2:594 Y1:451 Y2:516
Hermenthotip is gone. The time to
designate a new Pharaoh is at hand.

148
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:33,482  X1:320 X2:394 Y1:495 Y2:516
Wow!

149
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:37,771  X1:155 X2:559 Y1:451 Y2:516
At dawn, the high priest will
consult the Wall of Prophecy...

150
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:40,572  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:451 Y2:516
...to determine
Hermenthotip's successor.

151
00:12:42,373 --> 00:12:47,242  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:450 Y2:516
That ends the funeral. You don't have
to go home, but you can't stay here.

152
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,563  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:456 Y2:516
Can you believe it?
Pharaoh's dead!

153
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:57,124  X1:109 X2:605 Y1:451 Y2:516
Yes! Tonight we are slaves to no one!
Except the rhythm.

154
00:12:58,053 --> 00:13:00,328  X1:192 X2:522 Y1:490 Y2:516
Yeah! Play those bongos!

155
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:03,326  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:489 Y2:516
I'm gonna spin till I fall down!

156
00:13:20,453 --> 00:13:25,652  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:451 Y2:516
We interrupt this ancient prophecy
to bring you a late-breaking bulletin.

157
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:37,165  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:451 Y2:516
Great Wall of Prophecy! Reveal to us
God's will that we may blindly obey!

158
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,245  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:451 Y2:516
Free us from thought
and responsibility!

159
00:13:40,413 --> 00:13:43,689  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:456 Y2:516
- We shall read things off you!
- Then do them!

160
00:13:43,853 --> 00:13:46,765  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Your words guide us!
- We're dumb!

161
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:50,767  X1:149 X2:565 Y1:451 Y2:516
You know what else stinks
about being a slave? The hours.

162
00:13:50,973 --> 00:13:54,966  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:451 Y2:516
The prophecy is strange
and crudely drawn at best.

163
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:58,091  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:495 Y2:516
It indicates that we are here...

164
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:02,929  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:454 Y2:516
...and our next Pharaoh
is over there, near some tents.

165
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:07,564  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:451 Y2:516
Those are waves, jackass!
It's supposed to be a river!

166
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:11,410  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:454 Y2:516
- I know who the next Pharaoh is!
- Oh, lord.

167
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:16,727  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:451 Y2:516
We hear your voice, great Pharaoh!
Reveal yourself to us!

168
00:14:16,893 --> 00:14:22,172  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:451 Y2:516
Behold! I have emerged
from the place of spells and fairies!

169
00:14:23,173 --> 00:14:27,849  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:451 Y2:516
It is he, just as the Wall of Prophecy
prophesied!

170
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:31,601  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:490 Y2:516
Long live Pharaoh Bender!

171
00:14:31,773 --> 00:14:36,449  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Long live Pharaoh Bender!
- This society is a bunch of idiots.

172
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,971  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:489 Y2:516
People of O'Cyris Four!

173
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:47,969  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:451 Y2:516
Welcome a man who started as a slave,
but worked up to lord of all creation!

174
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:51,648  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:493 Y2:516
Our new Pharaoh, Bender!

175
00:15:00,293 --> 00:15:05,651  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516
Citizens of me! The cruelty of the old
Pharaoh is a thing of the past!

176
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:12,448  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:451 Y2:516
Let a whole new wave of cruelty
wash over this lazy land!

177
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:15,286  X1:245 X2:471 Y1:490 Y2:516
What did he say?

178
00:15:15,453 --> 00:15:20,573  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516
Hear the word of Pharaoh! Build unto
me a statue of ridiculous proportion!

179
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:23,042  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:490 Y2:516
One billion cubits in height...

180
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:26,928  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:451 Y2:516
...that I might be remembered
for all eternity!

181
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,572  X1:212 X2:502 Y1:490 Y2:516
And be quick about it.

182
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,568  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Lowly slave! Why are you not working?
- I am!

183
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:42,008  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:492 Y2:516
I meant, "Yourself to death?"

184
00:15:42,173 --> 00:15:44,448  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:493 Y2:516
Pharaoh, it hurts when I breathe.

185
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:47,923  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:451 Y2:516
Well then, what do you think
you should stop doing?

186
00:15:48,093 --> 00:15:49,970  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:490 Y2:516
Crawl, pigs!

187
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:53,646  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:490 Y2:516
The Pharaoh has spoken!

188
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:26,121  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:456 Y2:516
Your task is nearly completed.
Don't let down Pharaoh now!

189
00:16:33,173 --> 00:16:37,803  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:451 Y2:516
The great monument is finished,
oh, Pharaoh! And now the unveiling!

190
00:16:40,693 --> 00:16:43,287  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:495 Y2:516
<i>Remember me!</i>

191
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:46,172  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:495 Y2:516
<i>Remember me!</i>

192
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,244  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:495 Y2:516
<i>Remember me!</i>

193
00:16:48,413 --> 00:16:50,847  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:490 Y2:516
Does it please you, my lord?

194
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:53,369  X1:249 X2:466 Y1:489 Y2:516
It's a good start.

195
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:59,209  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:516
Yeah, it's definitely big. I just
wonder if it's too big, you know?

196
00:16:59,373 --> 00:17:02,843  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:456 Y2:516
Are people gonna be remembering me
or the statue?

197
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:05,846  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:451 Y2:516
We made it to your
exact specifications.

198
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:07,924  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:490 Y2:516
Too exact, if you ask me.

199
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:13,326  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:451 Y2:516
Tear it down and try again! But this
time, don't embarrass yourselves!

200
00:17:20,053 --> 00:17:23,204  X1:181 X2:533 Y1:451 Y2:516
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Pharaoh suddenly died.

201
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:32,364  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Good riddance.
- What about my servants?

202
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:34,291  X1:291 X2:425 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Oh, yeah.
- Right.

203
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:48,685  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:455 Y2:516
Bender, I really hope that's you,
because if it isn't...

204
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:50,487  X1:237 X2:479 Y1:494 Y2:516
...we're in trouble.

205
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,486  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:450 Y2:516
You jerk! Why'd you have
to drag us along?

206
00:17:53,653 --> 00:17:56,213  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:490 Y2:516
I wanted to watch you remember me.

207
00:17:59,253 --> 00:18:02,484  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:450 Y2:516
You thought you'd need
this junk in the afterlife?

208
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:04,086  X1:299 X2:417 Y1:495 Y2:516
Afterlife?

209
00:18:04,253 --> 00:18:07,723  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:451 Y2:516
If I had to go through another life,
I'd kill myself.

210
00:18:07,893 --> 00:18:10,407  X1:221 X2:494 Y1:451 Y2:516
Rot in peace.
Fry and I are leaving.

211
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:12,848  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:489 Y2:516
Sorry, but we're totally sealed in.

212
00:18:13,013 --> 00:18:16,926  X1:189 X2:525 Y1:451 Y2:516
Nothing can get in or out
except millions of snakes.

213
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:20,805  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:451 Y2:516
Have a pomegranate schnapps
from my distillery...

214
00:18:20,973 --> 00:18:24,522  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:454 Y2:516
...and start sharing fond
memories of me, Bender.

215
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:27,730  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:490 Y2:516
What proof is this? Some huge number?

216
00:18:29,613 --> 00:18:30,762  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:489 Y2:516
It's explosive!

217
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:35,165  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:451 Y2:516
We could ignite the distillery
and blow this place to rubble!

218
00:18:37,693 --> 00:18:40,491  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:489 Y2:516
Let's get a little kindling going.

219
00:18:43,213 --> 00:18:46,649  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:455 Y2:516
You can't blow up my monument!
I won't be remembered!

220
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:51,284  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:451 Y2:516
Oh, right. How selfish of me.
We'll just stay here forever.

221
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:55,287  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hey, Fry? Remember that robot, Bender?

222
00:18:55,453 --> 00:18:57,842  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:489 Y2:516
Bender? Doesn't ring a bell.

223
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:00,890  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Did you hear something?
- No.

224
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:03,692  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:450 Y2:516
I bet it wasn't someone
good at stealing.

225
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:06,970  X1:213 X2:501 Y1:455 Y2:516
Stop it! It's not right!
You've crossed a line!

226
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:09,931  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:456 Y2:516
- You know who I remember?
- Let it be me.

227
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:13,165  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:456 Y2:516
- That guy who used to bend things.
- Me? Please?

228
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,972  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Hermes!
- All right, all right!

229
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:19,762  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:451 Y2:516
If it means that much to you,
blow up my statue.

230
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:24,006  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:456 Y2:516
Oh, Bender! When did you come in?
Hold still.

231
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:35,163  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:494 Y2:516
Let's blow this tomb.

232
00:19:45,213 --> 00:19:48,683  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:451 Y2:516
Pharaoh Bender!
He once more walks among the living!

233
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:50,286  X1:259 X2:459 Y1:490 Y2:516
How we doing?

234
00:20:02,013 --> 00:20:04,208  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:495 Y2:516
<i>Remember me!</i>

235
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:07,482  X1:282 X2:433 Y1:495 Y2:516
I will. I will.

236
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:20,768  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:490 Y2:516
Please just leave me alone.

237
00:20:24,013 --> 00:20:26,971  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:456 Y2:516
I understand your desire
to be remembered...

238
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:30,091  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:455 Y2:516
...but you don't need
a statue for that.

239
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:31,925  X1:304 X2:413 Y1:455 Y2:516
- I don't?
- No.

240
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:35,722  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:451 Y2:516
You have your legacy as a brutal,
tyrannical dictator...

241
00:20:35,893 --> 00:20:38,487  X1:210 X2:505 Y1:451 Y2:516
...and that will
outlive any monument.

242
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:41,690  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:450 Y2:516
- You think they'll remember me?
- Absolutely.

243
00:20:41,853 --> 00:20:45,528  X1:120 X2:594 Y1:490 Y2:516
Well, in that case, one planet down.

244
00:20:45,693 --> 00:20:49,447  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:493 Y2:516
Helmsmen, set course for Earth!

245
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,372  X1:244 X2:472 Y1:455 Y2:516
- That's not Earth.
- Oh.
