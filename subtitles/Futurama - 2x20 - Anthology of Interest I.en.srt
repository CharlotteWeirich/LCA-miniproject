Anthology of lnterest 1

2
00:00:31,413 --> 00:00:32,687
Good news, everyone!

3
00:00:32,973 --> 00:00:37,603
My new invention lets you operate
equipment from great distances.

4
00:00:37,853 --> 00:00:40,367
I call it the "Fing-Longer. "

5
00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:41,932
Observe.

6
00:00:42,173 --> 00:00:45,210
And here we go.

7
00:00:45,453 --> 00:00:46,966
There!

8
00:00:48,213 --> 00:00:49,771
Pretty long, eh?

9
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:53,005
Yeah, really long!
But what's that?

10
00:00:53,293 --> 00:00:55,966
That's my What-lf Machine.

11
00:00:56,213 --> 00:01:01,412
Ask a "what-if" question and it
simulates what would happen.

12
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:03,923
-Does it really work?
-Of course!

13
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:05,964
It's just not very long.

14
00:01:06,213 --> 00:01:08,169
I got a question!

15
00:01:08,573 --> 00:01:14,170
As a robot among humans, I never feel
accepted at parties or nude beaches.

16
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:17,171
So I've always
secretly wondered. . . .

17
00:01:17,373 --> 00:01:20,729
What if I was 500 feet tall?

18
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:23,368
Let's watch, shall we?

19
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:37,485
My work here is done.

20
00:02:01,093 --> 00:02:04,324
I'm so lonely since I came
to the future.

21
00:02:04,573 --> 00:02:05,801
Will you be my friend?

22
00:02:15,573 --> 00:02:17,086
Who are you?

23
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:20,490
I'm a big robot!
And I want a big cereal.

24
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:23,770
You too? Will you be my friend?

25
00:02:24,453 --> 00:02:26,444
Put her there, pal!

26
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:28,322
No, your wallet.

27
00:02:28,573 --> 00:02:30,370
Three, two, one, zero!

28
00:03:19,813 --> 00:03:21,804
That calms the shakes.

29
00:03:28,053 --> 00:03:31,284
-Quit it!
-Stop! He's not your enemy!

30
00:03:31,493 --> 00:03:33,961
He's just a misunderstood--

31
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:52,206
Well, there goes the neighborhood.

32
00:03:52,453 --> 00:03:54,648
-And another one.
-We're jerked!

33
00:03:54,853 --> 00:03:59,802
-Nothing can stop a monster that big!
-Except an equally big monster.

34
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:03,688
We can try my experimental
enlarging ray.

35
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:05,764
We'll need a guinea pig.

36
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:14,286
What? Two meals in one week?

37
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:18,768
Gotcha!

38
00:04:19,013 --> 00:04:21,049
A guinea pig tricked me!

39
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:25,728
What?

40
00:04:28,173 --> 00:04:33,372
So now Zoidberg is big.
That's more like it!

41
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,724
Who's intimidating who now, big city?

42
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:39,567
Hello, Mr. Chase Manhattan Bank.

43
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:43,561
Deny my credit card
application, will you?

44
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,005
Ah, the Apollo Theater.

45
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:53,043
Boo me off-stage on open-mike night?
I'll show you!

46
00:04:55,893 --> 00:04:59,408
I called this city!
Quit touching my stuff!

47
00:04:59,653 --> 00:05:00,972
Tell it to the claw!

48
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:03,852
Bite my colossal metal ass!

49
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:42,165
Who wants lobster bisque?

50
00:05:48,053 --> 00:05:50,123
Want to make Shrinky Dinks?

51
00:05:58,573 --> 00:06:01,087
Who put this in here?

52
00:06:06,853 --> 00:06:09,572
No!

53
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:17,963
Are you people satisfied?
This gentle visitor is dying!

54
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:22,121
-We'll never even know why he came.
-I'll tell you. . .

55
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,608
. . .with my final breath.

56
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,689
I came here with a simple dream. . .

57
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:34,892
. . .a dream of killing all humans.

58
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:38,569
And this is how it must end?

59
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:44,007
Who's the real seven-billion-ton
robot monster here?

60
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:47,167
Not l.

61
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:51,765
Not l.

62
00:06:55,573 --> 00:06:57,450
Good night, sweet prince.

63
00:06:59,973 --> 00:07:02,168
Interesting stuff.

64
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:07,487
Stay tuned for more
Tales of lnterest!

65
00:07:10,853 --> 00:07:14,289
Well, Leela? Care to try
the What-lf Machine?

66
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:17,286
I don't know what to ask about.

67
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:19,524
Just pick something, woman!

68
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:22,964
Yeah, be more impulsive. Like this.

69
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,564
Go, man, go!

70
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:31,567
I can be impulsive.
It just takes me a while.

71
00:07:34,013 --> 00:07:35,969
All right, let's do it.

72
00:07:36,173 --> 00:07:39,961
What if I was a little more impulsive?

73
00:07:40,213 --> 00:07:41,566
Just a little.

74
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:44,046
Not too much.

75
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:48,805
Look what I bought on a wild impulse!

76
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:49,963
New boots!

77
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:53,962
They're like my old ones,
but with a crazy green stripe!

78
00:07:54,253 --> 00:07:56,972
Never know what I'm gonna do next.

79
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:04,843
Come here, Leela.
I have something important to say.

80
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:07,362
I'm old and I need an heir.

81
00:08:07,573 --> 00:08:09,882
Someone to spend my riches. . .

82
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:13,205
. . .and care for my
man-eating anteaters.

83
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:19,289
The others aren't levelheaded.
They're too impulsive.

84
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:24,243
Not like you. Not like predictable,
dull-as-dishwater Leela.

85
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:26,643
Hello? New boots?

86
00:08:26,853 --> 00:08:29,162
So I've made you my sole heir.

87
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:33,042
The day I die, you'll be a very
wealthy woman.

88
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:36,205
Oh, my, yes. Incredibly wealthy.

89
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:41,089
The day I die. Because you're
so un-impulsive.

90
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:49,610
You've killed me! You've killed me!

91
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:51,491
What have I done?

92
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:54,645
I just told you! You've killed me!

93
00:08:58,173 --> 00:09:00,562
Okay, try to be nonchalant.

94
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:07,731
All right, you're nonchalant.
Don't rub our noses in it.

95
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:10,208
Sweet anteater of Santa Anita!

96
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:12,603
The professor's been eaten!

97
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:13,809
What?

98
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:16,083
It's mighty suspicious.

99
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,370
I'll call the cops.
After I flush some things.

100
00:09:19,573 --> 00:09:21,689
Police? Nosy meddlers.

101
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:27,565
I happen to have mail-order degrees
in Murder-ology and Murder-onomy.

102
00:09:27,813 --> 00:09:29,724
Zoidberg is afoot!

103
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:32,208
Perhaps his files can help.

104
00:09:32,413 --> 00:09:34,608
"Citation for Public Nudity. "

105
00:09:34,853 --> 00:09:36,969
Another one.

106
00:09:37,213 --> 00:09:40,603
A new will, naming. . . .

107
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:44,448
-You! As his sole heir!
-What does that prove?

108
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:48,129
It's a video will.
It shows you killing him.

109
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:56,683
All right, anteater number one.
Who did it?

110
00:09:56,933 --> 00:09:58,969
Was it anteater number two?

111
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:02,970
Don't stick your tongue out at me!
I need a name!

112
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,969
What? How do you spell that?

113
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:10,004
What are you hacking off?
My torso?

114
00:10:10,253 --> 00:10:13,006
It is! My precious torso!

115
00:10:13,253 --> 00:10:16,529
Hermes, quiet! I'm deducing things!

116
00:10:19,173 --> 00:10:21,812
-Got disposal trouble?
-No!

117
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:25,602
Shocking about the professor.
And now Hermes is missing.

118
00:10:25,853 --> 00:10:27,889
Well, doesn't affect me.

119
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:29,566
Hey, what's this?

120
00:10:29,773 --> 00:10:31,889
Hermes' dreadlocks? And his arm?

121
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,248
I'm shocked!

122
00:10:34,413 --> 00:10:37,610
Food in the disposal.
Hair and flesh go in the trash!

123
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:39,411
I couldn't stop.

124
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:42,690
Wait. Don't you care
that I killed him?

125
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:45,361
Ain't nothing wrong with murder. . .

126
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:47,843
. . .as long as I can wet my beak.

127
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:49,168
Blackmail?

128
00:10:49,373 --> 00:10:54,322
I prefer the word extortion.
The "x" makes it sound cool.

129
00:10:57,493 --> 00:11:00,007
Please, I'm made of metal. You--

130
00:11:00,253 --> 00:11:02,130
Wait, not the microwave!

131
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:12,602
Okay, that's it.

132
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:17,967
No more killing.
Next time, just have a stick of gum.

133
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:20,491
Now, to hide the body.

134
00:11:22,053 --> 00:11:23,406
Honk, honk!

135
00:11:23,613 --> 00:11:26,605
Sporty go-cart, Leela!
So hip and sexy!

136
00:11:26,813 --> 00:11:27,882
So unlike you.

137
00:11:29,013 --> 00:11:30,332
Got any gum?

138
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:31,761
No.

139
00:11:43,893 --> 00:11:45,121
Everyone's here.

140
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,164
-Who are you?
-Scruffy, the janitor.

141
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,888
-I've never seen you before.
-I've never seen you neither.

142
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:52,082
Quiet, please.

143
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:57,208
I've called you all here to watch me
gradually solve the crime.

144
00:11:57,453 --> 00:12:00,251
One of you is a big murderer!

145
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:07,086
The killer left one fatal clue.

146
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,893
The boot print on this lab coat.

147
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:13,570
Couldn't be me. I never wear boots.

148
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:15,049
See?

149
00:12:15,253 --> 00:12:17,289
What smells like boot feet?

150
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:19,844
This is preposterous!

151
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:22,567
Obviously, the murderer is--

152
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:28,812
My next clue came at 4: 1 5,
when the clock stopped.

153
00:12:29,053 --> 00:12:31,931
Two hours later, at 4: 1 5. . .

154
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:37,048
. . .I discovered the murdered body
of Amy's dead, deceased corpse.

155
00:12:38,213 --> 00:12:40,363
I know who killed them people.

156
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:43,565
In Scruffy's opinion, it were--

157
00:12:46,053 --> 00:12:47,930
It's as I suspected.

158
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:49,925
The crime is unsolvable.

159
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:02,407
A letter from my friend Bender.

160
00:13:02,653 --> 00:13:06,965
"Dear Doctor Jerk-berg, if
you're reading this, I'm dead.

161
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:09,169
The murderer was. . . . "

162
00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:13,569
My God! It can't be!

163
00:13:13,813 --> 00:13:15,132
The murderer, it was--

164
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:18,689
I'm bored. You're boring.

165
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:20,161
What's on TV?

166
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:23,371
Could you get the lights
on your way out?

167
00:13:25,173 --> 00:13:26,322
What's that?

168
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:28,125
Lobster. You want some?

169
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,129
Sure.

170
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:33,849
-I think I figured out those deaths.
-Really?

171
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:36,851
Are we near an lndian graveyard?

172
00:13:37,093 --> 00:13:38,731
-No.
-No?

173
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:42,171
Then it was you!

174
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:44,052
What's come over me?

175
00:13:44,253 --> 00:13:48,326
I killed one person on impulse.
Then another. And another.

176
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:50,285
That covers three.

177
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:53,371
Now, to make sure you won't talk. . .

178
00:13:53,573 --> 00:13:57,964
. . .I'm gonna have to do
something really impulsive!

179
00:14:01,493 --> 00:14:05,088
So, what do you think of the
impulsive new me?

180
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,288
I like it.

181
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:10,572
Good. Now let me just get the lights.

182
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,362
I really like it.

183
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:23,566
Who else has a question for
the machine? Scruffy? Fry?

184
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:24,848
I have one.

185
00:14:25,173 --> 00:14:28,404
-What if Bender was giant?
-We already saw that.

186
00:14:28,653 --> 00:14:30,723
I know. I want to see it again.

187
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:33,322
No, ask something less stupid.

188
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:34,852
Oh, how about this?

189
00:14:35,053 --> 00:14:38,170
What if I never came to the future?

190
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:42,571
There, now that question
is somewhat less stupid.

191
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:46,482
What would happen if Fry never came
to the future?

192
00:14:56,973 --> 00:14:59,726
Hello? Pizza delivery for. . .

193
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,366
. . . "I.C. Wiener. "

194
00:15:01,573 --> 00:15:02,608
Oh, crud.

195
00:15:06,053 --> 00:15:09,363
Here's to another lousy millennium.

196
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:21,567
You're going back in the toilet!

197
00:15:26,413 --> 00:15:27,368
What is it?

198
00:15:27,613 --> 00:15:30,844
A rip in the very fabric
of space-time.

199
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:33,567
Hey, look! An ugly, scared guy!

200
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:41,201
Is one of you l.C. Wiener?

201
00:15:41,413 --> 00:15:44,007
If that's his pizza, then I am.

202
00:15:51,253 --> 00:15:53,562
You believe me about the monsters,
right?

203
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:58,369
There's only three monsters, kid.
Dracula, Blacula and Son of Kong.

204
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:01,963
Now quit picking your nose
and knead that dough!

205
00:16:04,853 --> 00:16:07,321
The usual, Professor Hawking?

206
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,763
No, I'd like something good.

207
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:13,122
Hawking, you're all right!

208
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,689
Stephen Hawking!
Didn't you invent gravity?

209
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:18,366
Sure. Why not?

210
00:16:18,573 --> 00:16:23,567
Has anyone ever seen a hole
in space with monsters in it?

211
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:26,810
If I'm the first,
I'll call it a "Fry Hole. "

212
00:16:27,013 --> 00:16:29,288
There is no need to worry.

213
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:31,888
I must go. There is much to do.

214
00:16:34,773 --> 00:16:36,525
Hawking, your pizza!

215
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:38,724
Toss it in the garbage.

216
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,005
There he is. Seize him.

217
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:46,766
Who said that?

218
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:53,968
Who are you?

219
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:57,609
I'm AI Gore.
These are my V.P. Action Rangers.

220
00:16:57,853 --> 00:17:02,802
Our sole duty is to prevent disruption
in the space-time continuum.

221
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:06,130
Isn't your sole duty
to break ties in the Senate?

222
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:10,212
That, and protect
the space-time continuum.

223
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:12,889
You want to see my Fry Hole?

224
00:17:13,093 --> 00:17:17,564
Oh, yes. But first, meet the team.
You know Stephen Hawking.

225
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:21,163
Nichelle Nichols,
a.k.a. Commander Uhura.

226
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,683
Incoming transmission from MCl.

227
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:26,565
It sounds like low rates.

228
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,007
I'm in the tub!

229
00:17:28,253 --> 00:17:32,565
This is Gary Gygax,
inventor of Dungeons & Dragons.

230
00:17:32,773 --> 00:17:36,129
Greetings!
It's a pleasure to meet you!

231
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:40,690
And our intern, Deep Blue,
the chess-playing computer.

232
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:42,651
Bishop to knight 4.

233
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:47,404
Not every mission can be solved
by chess, Deep Blue.

234
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:48,728
Where am l?

235
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:52,164
You're in a terrestrial
transport module.

236
00:17:52,373 --> 00:17:53,488
A school bus!

237
00:17:55,613 --> 00:17:56,682
What's going on?

238
00:17:56,893 --> 00:17:59,453
It's about that rip in space-time.

239
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:01,450
I call it a "Hawking Hole. "

240
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:03,291
Hey, I saw it first!

241
00:18:03,493 --> 00:18:06,769
Who will The Journal
of Quantum Physics believe?

242
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:11,569
Apparently, something was
supposed to happen but didn't. . .

243
00:18:11,773 --> 00:18:13,843
. . .due to quantum flux.

244
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:16,567
So we had to beat you with rackets.

245
00:18:16,773 --> 00:18:19,082
If that event doesn't occur. . .

246
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,086
. . .the universe will be destroyed.

247
00:18:23,173 --> 00:18:26,370
As an environmentalist,
I'm against that.

248
00:18:31,573 --> 00:18:34,724
So then I almost fell
into this thingy.

249
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:36,764
I call it a "Hawking Chamber. "

250
00:18:36,973 --> 00:18:39,885
But I missed and wanged my head.

251
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:43,762
Well, obviously that wang
should have killed you.

252
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:46,407
-What?
-Let's finish the job!

253
00:18:46,653 --> 00:18:49,645
No, wait! There must be a peaceful--

254
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:51,771
-Hold him down.
-Check.

255
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:04,363
Something's wrong!
Murder isn't working.

256
00:19:04,573 --> 00:19:07,770
Let's try something else.
We should. . . .

257
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,288
Put the dice away.

258
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:12,171
I'm getting an idea!

259
00:19:12,413 --> 00:19:14,973
What if he was meant to be frozen?

260
00:19:15,173 --> 00:19:18,290
Yes, shove him in the tube.
It was my idea.

261
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:22,766
There he is again! He brought nerds!

262
00:19:22,973 --> 00:19:24,486
Take this!

263
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:29,686
Hurry, get in before
the universe collapses!

264
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:35,683
I'll need a weapon
to fight drunken robots!

265
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:38,128
Here, take my plus-one mace!

266
00:19:39,373 --> 00:19:41,409
Okay. Here I go.

267
00:19:44,653 --> 00:19:47,213
You fool! You foolish fool!

268
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,045
What could go wrong?

269
00:20:06,453 --> 00:20:09,365
Great. The universe was destroyed.

270
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:11,370
Then where are we now?

271
00:20:11,613 --> 00:20:16,289
I can darn well tell you where
we're not. The universe.

272
00:20:17,253 --> 00:20:21,963
Eternity with nerds. It's a Star Trek
convention all over again!

273
00:20:22,173 --> 00:20:25,643
Anyone want to play
Dungeons & Dragons?

274
00:20:25,853 --> 00:20:27,764
-Yeah.
-Sure.

275
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:30,203
I'm a 1 0th-level vice president.

276
00:20:31,653 --> 00:20:35,612
That was preposterous.
Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria.

277
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:39,163
This thing isn't worth
the gold it's made of.

278
00:20:39,493 --> 00:20:43,566
Anyway, the Fing-Longer
seems to be a success.

279
00:20:43,773 --> 00:20:46,082
-Way to go!
-Right on, professor.

280
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:52,645
So that's how it would be if I'd
invented the Fing-Longer.

281
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:55,931
A man can dream though.

282
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:59,206
A man can dream.
