mtv networks

2
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:02,801
katara: water...

3
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:04,703
earth...

4
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:06,805
fire...

5
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:09,241
air.

6
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,476
long ago...

7
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,511
the four natio lived
together in harmony.

8
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:17,516
then everything change
when the fire nation attacked.

9
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:21,720
only the avatar, master of all
four elements could stophem.

10
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,555
but when the world
needed him most

11
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:25,524
he vanished.

12
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:29,294
100 years passed, and myrother
and i discovered the new avatar

13
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,130
an airbender named aang.

14
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,465
and although his airbending
skills were great

15
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:36,702
he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.

16
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:41,006
but i believe aang
can save the world.

17
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,548
man: previously on "avatar... "

18
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,417
aang: blending in is better
than hiding out.

19
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:55,888
if we get fire nation disguises, we'll be
just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave.

20
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,656
you have no right
to judge me, uncle.

21
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:02,294
i did what i had to do in ba sing se,
and you wer a fool for not joining me.

22
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,367
i see you favor
the white lotus gambit.

23
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,803
not many still cling
to the ancient ways.

24
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,740
those who do can always
find a friend.

25
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:27,820
katara: wow, this is amazing
to watch.

26
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,723
kind of makes you realize
how insignificant we are.

27
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:34,793
eh, u've seen nothing once,
you've seen it 1,000 times.

28
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,830
sokka: oh, man.

29
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,965
you've never not seen
anything like this.

30
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:57,816
katara: the fire is gonna
destroy that town.

31
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,218
aangnot if we can stop it.

32
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,722
there's a creek over here.

33
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,624
i'll bend the water
on to the fire.

34
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:08,761
toph, let's make a trench to keep
the fire from coming any closer.

35
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,363
what should i do?

36
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,166
keep an eye on momo.

37
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,770
so what, i'm just
a ler-sitter?

38
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:18,837
there, there.

39
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:19,772
feel better?

40
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:59,044
sokka, stand clear.

41
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:01,146
right, stand clear.

42
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:01,847
got it.

43
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,958
good work, everybody.

44
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,246
man: look at you.

45
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,082
you're just a fat,
disgusting old man.

46
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,518
you do nothing, you say nothing.

47
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:43,222
you just eat and roll around
in your own filth like a pig.

48
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,656
you're a disgrace.

49
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:04,109
these people have no idea how close
they were to getting toasted last night.

50
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,545
yeah, the worst thing
about being in disguise

51
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,081
is we don't get
the hero worship anymore.

52
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,783
i miss the love.

53
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:13,686
boo-hoo, poor heroes.

54
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,287
what's your oblem?

55
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,556
you haven't even touched
your smoked sea slug.

56
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,592
it's just, all you guys can do
this awesome bending stuff

57
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:25,097
like putting out forest fires, and flying
around, and making other stuff fly around.

58
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,900
i can't fly around, ok?

59
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,302
i can't do anything.

60
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,104
that's not true.

61
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,239
no one can read a map ke you.

62
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,874
i can't read at all.

63
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,711
yeah, and who keeps us laughing
with sarcastic comments all the time?

64
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,680
i mean,
lo at katara's hair, right?

65
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,848
what's up with that?

66
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:43,716
what?

67
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,250
what's wrong with my hair?

68
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,052
nothing, i was just trying to...

69
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:50,089
sokka: look, i appreciat
the effort, but the fact is

70
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:55,160
each of you is so amazing
and so special, and i'm not.

71
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,797
i'm just the guy
in the group who's regular.

72
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:06,638
i'm sorry you're feeling so down, but i
hope yoknow none of us see you that way.

73
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,943
i know something that's gonna
ma you feel better.

74
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,711
you do?

75
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,014
shopping.

76
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:18,951
maybe a little something
to rnvigorate my battling.

77
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,986
hey, how about these?

78
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,222
hi-ya!

79
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,757
"smack-a-dacka-doo!"

80
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,195
aang: what do you think?

81
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:34,299
pretty slick, huh?

82
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,835
all i need to complete
the outfit is a wind sword.

83
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,137
what's a wind sword?

84
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:39,605
it's where i get a sword handle

85
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,975
and then i just swing this around
and bend air out like a blade.

86
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,414
yeah, nice.

87
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,818
i'll jt ick to what i got.

88
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,411
ooh.

89
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,047
that's what sokka's
talking about.

90
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,215
man: you have a good eye.

91
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,284
that's an original from piandao

92
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,320
the greate sword master and
sword mar in fire nation history.

93
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,290
he lives in the big castle
up the road from here.

94
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,292
that's it.

95
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,394
that's what you needed
all along, sokka.

96
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,095
a sword?

97
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,262
not the sword.

98
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,131
a master.

99
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,266
we've all had masters
to help us get better.

100
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,202
you should see if you
can study with piandao.

101
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:44,803
that's a great idea.

102
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,573
i could've never gotten to where
i am without master pakku.

103
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,274
everyone needs a teacher.

104
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,477
i learned from badger moles.

105
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,846
they don't talk,
but they're still od teachers.

106
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:57,116
it would be nice to be
a master swordfighter.

107
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,352
all right, i'll talk to him.

108
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,681
can i help you?

109
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,516
i've come to train
with the master.

110
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,886
you should know the master
turns almost everyone away.

111
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,488
what did you bring him
to prove your worth?

112
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,792
well, uh...

113
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:40,993
right.

114
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,728
let's get this over with.

115
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:58,377
master, my name is sokka, and i wish to
be instructed in the way of the sword.

116
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,045
piandao: sokka.

117
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,847
that's an unusual name.

118
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,349
oh, uh, really?

119
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,684
uh, where i come from,
the fire nation colonies

120
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:09,488
it's a pretty normal name,
for fire nation colonials.

121
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,256
piandao: let me guess.

122
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,959
you've come hundreds of miles
from your little village

123
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,628
where you're the best
swordsman in town

124
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,065
and you think you deserve
to learn from the master.

125
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,534
well, actually, i've been
all over the world.

126
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,937
piandao: yep, here we go.

127
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,008
i have a lot to learn.

128
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:33,078
you're not doing a very good job
of selling yourself.

129
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,680
i know.

130
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,516
your butler told me that when i
met you, i would have to prove worth

131
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,452
but the truth is,
i don't know if i am worthy.

132
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,255
hm, i see.

133
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:48,761
wellthen, let's find out
together how worthy you are.

134
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,664
i will train you.

135
00:08:55,802 --> 00:09:01,507
rself.

136
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,243
you must think of it as
another part of your own body.

137
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,813
like a second head.

138
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:12,951
well, more like
an extra-long, really sharp arm.

139
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,789
the sword is a simple tool,
but in the hands of a master

140
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:22,661
it becomes the most versatile of weapons,
and just as the imagination is limitless

141
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,764
so too are the possibilities
of the sword.

142
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,169
aang: what should we do today?

143
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,437
i'm tapped out.

144
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,539
i already picked my toes, twice.

145
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,374
twice?

146
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:40,646
the first time was for cleaning, but the second
time's just for the sweet picking sensation.

147
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,414
sokka's been in charge
of the schedule.

148
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,083
i'm not sure
what we should be doing.

149
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:47,286
plus, it's so hot today.

150
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,987
how hot is it?

151
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:49,822
i don't know.

152
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,090
real hot?

153
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:56,995
it's so hot, it's so hot,
momo is shedding like appa.

154
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,233
huh, huh?

155
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,969
i guess the jokes
don't run in the family.

156
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,438
katara: oh, everyone's a critic.

157
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:23,355
the warrior practices a variety of
arts to keep his mind sharp and fluid.

158
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,657
the first you will learn
is calligraphy.

159
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,327
write your name.

160
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:31,163
writing my name will make me
a better swordsman?

161
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:35,634
when you write your name, you
stamp the paper with your identity

162
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:39,972
you must learn to use your sword to
stamp your identity on a battlefield.

163
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:48,580
remember, you cannot take back a stroke
of the brush, or a stroke of the sword.

164
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:55,854
you are getting ink
on your face.

165
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,523
i am?

166
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:58,791
i am.

167
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,793
so this is about putting
my identity on the page, right?

168
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:31,357
landscape painting teaches a warrior
to hold the lay of the land in his mind.

169
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,364
in battle, you only have an
instant to take everything in.

170
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,139
now, paint it.

171
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:51,043
and no peeking.

172
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,762
sokka: i'm finished.

173
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,064
you added a rainbow.

174
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,967
is that ok?

175
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,176
piandao: sokka.

176
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:29,682
concentrate on
what you're doing.

177
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:33,652
rock gardening teaches the warrior
to manipulate his surroundings

178
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,155
and use them to his advantage.

179
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:40,359
hm, manipulate them
to my advantage.

180
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,829
oh.

181
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,844
ah.

182
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,250
hey, would you mind grabbing
a cold drink for m

183
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,554
i'll take a slice of lemon
in mine, please.

184
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,594
what's going on in there?

185
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,501
crazy old man.

186
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,109
katara: so where are
we going next?

187
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,445
we're starting from here.

188
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,747
no, we're over on this island.

189
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,650
you noodle-brains don't know
what you're doing.

190
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:12,951
i miss sokka.

191
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,254
ooh, i got one.

192
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,791
if you miss him so much,
why don't you marry him?

193
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,434
piandao: you've had a good
first day of training.

194
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,235
i have?

195
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,571
but i thought i messed up
every single thing we worked on.

196
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:36,108
you messed things up
in a very special way.

197
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,711
you are ready for a real sword.

198
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,113
are you giving me one of yours?

199
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,014
no.

200
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,752
your sword must be
an extension of yourself

201
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:50,689
so tomorw, you will make
your own sword.

202
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,834
choosing the correct material the most
important step in crafting a sword.

203
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:04,636
you must trust your steel
with your life.

204
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:05,738
choose carefully.

205
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:15,814
master, would it be possible for me to leave
and bring back a special material for my sword?

206
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,284
i wouldn't have it
any other way.

207
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:23,822
sokka's coming.

208
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:25,791
hey, guys.

209
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:26,692
what are you doing?

210
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:27,292
aang: sokka?

211
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:27,960
to: you're back.

212
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,962
we missed you so much.

213
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,597
say something funny.

214
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,065
funny how?

215
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,403
what's the deal?

216
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:38,871
i don't know.

217
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,472
they missed you or something.

218
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:41,940
i didn't care.

219
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:42,841
thanks.

220
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,576
that warms my heart.

221
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,045
anyway, i need some help.

222
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:23,315
who's this?

223
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,217
oh, these are my friends.

224
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,854
just other good
fire nation folks.

225
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:31,690
do you think we can make
a sword out of a meteorite?

226
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:35,327
we'll make a sword unlike
any other in the world.

227
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,090
sokka, when you first arrived,
you were so unsure.

228
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,392
you even seemed
down on yourself.

229
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:43,128
but i saw something
in you right away.

230
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:47,866
i saw a heart as strong as
a lion turtle, and twice as g

231
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:52,271
and as we trained, it wasn't
your skills that impressed me.

232
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:56,075
no, it certainly
wasn't your skills.

233
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,779
you showed something
beyond that.

234
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,085
creativity, versatility,
intelligence.

235
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,721
these are the traits
that define a great swordsman

236
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:12,725
and these are the traits
that define you.

237
00:18:12,726 --> 00:18:17,029
you told me you didn't know
if you were rthy

238
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:23,102
but i believe that you are more worthy
than any man i have ever trained.

239
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,906
i'm sorry, master.

240
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:29,041
you're wrong.

241
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:31,110
i am not worthy.

242
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,178
i'm not who you think i am.

243
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,346
i'm not from the fire nation.

244
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,548
i'm from the southern
water tribe.

245
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:39,385
i lied so that i could
learn swordsmanship from you.

246
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,286
i'm sorry.

247
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:44,623
i'm sorry, too.

248
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,897
no, this is my fight, alone.

249
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:59,038
you used to be
the pride of the fire nation.

250
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:02,141
our top general,
the dragon of the west.

251
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:06,011
now, look at you.

252
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,067
piandao: excellent.

253
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:05,204
using your superior agility
against an older opponent.

254
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,472
smart.

255
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:24,490
piandao: good use of train.

256
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:25,624
fighting from the high ground.

257
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:53,952
yes, use your surrouings.

258
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:55,721
make them fight for you.

259
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:14,907
very resourceful.

260
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,571
excellent work, sokka.

261
00:21:53,947 --> 00:21:57,449
i think i'm a little old
to be fighting the avatar.

262
00:21:58,818 --> 00:21:59,618
how did you know?

263
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:02,221
oh, i've been around a while.

264
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:03,655
you pick things up.

265
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:06,091
of course, i knew from the
beginning that sokka was water tribe.

266
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:10,396
you might want to think of
a better fire nation cover name.

267
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:12,398
try "lee."

268
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:13,999
there's a million lees.

269
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:20,439
the way of the sword doesn't
belong to any one nation.

270
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,142
knowledge of the arts
belongs to us all.

271
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:32,151
soa, you must continue
your training on your own.

272
00:22:32,252 --> 00:22:35,888
if you stay on this path,
i know that one day

273
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:39,191
you will becoman even
greater master than i am.

274
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:49,702
wait.

275
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:54,506
the master wanted you to have this,
as something to remember him by.

276
00:23:01,915 --> 00:23:03,148
it's a pal sho tile.

277
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,817
aang: the white lotus.

278
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:05,718
hm.

279
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:06,752
katara: what does it mean?

280
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:07,753
i have no idea.

281
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:13,158
ooh, that reminds me.

282
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:14,626
toph, i thought
you might like this

283
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:17,930
since you've probably never had a
chance to bend space earth before.

284
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:19,832
sweet.

285
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:22,968
check this out.

286
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:28,374
you know, i don't think there's
such a thing as "space earth."

287
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:31,343
if it's from space,
then it's not really earth.

288
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:32,778
sokka: must you ruin everything?

289
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:34,513
katara: i can't believe
i missed you.
