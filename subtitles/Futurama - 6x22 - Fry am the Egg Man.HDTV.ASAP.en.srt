Run, Leela!

They're bouncing right at us.

5
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:36,893
So, anybody hungry?

6
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:38,728
I could stuff myself.

7

I'll use that free app

Welcome to Fishy Joe's.

16

Today is Stroganoff Thursday.

17
00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:12,028
We are currently out
of the following menu items.

Stroganoff.

Got it.

26
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,546
Huh. Buggalo tots?

How about the
gardener-lover's salad?

32
00:01:36,787 --> 00:01:38,521
What kind of cheese filling
you want in that?

33
00:01:38,589 --> 00:01:40,957
Ugh! Just give me the fruit cup.

Okeydoke.

36

Oh, God.

37
00:01:50,668 --> 00:01:53,470
Fruit is spelled f-r-o-o-t.

38
00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:55,939
And it's got quotation marks
around it.

39
00:01:56,006 --> 00:01:57,574
Mmm. There's nothing wrong

Oh! I got a bone in my fruit!

That's it.

45
00:02:16,627 --> 00:02:18,428
From now on,
we're not eating anything

46
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,964
unless we know what it is
and where it's from.

47
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:22,932
We're going
to the local farmers market.

48

Aw, mom, do we have to?

49

See all the dirt and earwigs?

51
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,693
That's the sign
of healthy food.

52

You think that's healthy,
try this.

53

I found it growing
at the bottom of my hamper.

You want sample small-batch
Amazonian maple syrup?

58
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:12,182
Sure.

59
00:03:15,252 --> 00:03:16,753
Mm. Ah!

The richest, most
obnoxious kind!

65
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:32,502
Listen, pal, I'm looking
for a versatile smoke,

66
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,504
one that's equally good
in a crowded elevator

67
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:35,972
or an audience with the pope.

68
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,274
Forget the pope, my friend.

69
00:03:38,342 --> 00:03:40,343
Smoke one of these,

70
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:43,880
and God himself will ask
to be seated far away from you.

71
00:03:43,948 --> 00:03:45,448
Ooh!

72
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,383
Heirloom eggs?

73
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:49,352
That's so life-affirming.

74
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,054
I'll bet you run
your own hatchery,

75
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:54,724
just you and your wife...
Matilda.

76
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:57,794
No, ma'am. Matilda and I gather
them eggs in the forest.

77
00:03:57,861 --> 00:04:00,563
And Matilda's really more
of a mongoose than a wife.

You're a lucky man.

79
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:04,467
But are they way more expensive
than regular eggs?

80
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,401
Way more.

81
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:07,670
Ooh! I'll take a dozen.

82
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,613

eating healthy, organic food.

Blackmail? What

They're wholesome, fertile
and fresh from the forest floor.

There's some filth.

92
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:39,769
"Fertile"? What does that mean?

93
00:04:39,837 --> 00:04:42,438
It means it will hatch
into a tiny, little,

00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:45,475
infant creature unless
we cook it first.

Hey, Leela, hurry up

00:09:17,392 --> 00:09:19,760
Well, that depends on what
one of those things is.

165
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:22,029
That seems like a
fact worth knowing.

166
00:09:22,097 --> 00:09:25,499
Good startling news, everyone.

167
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:27,535
I found a description
of the creature

168
00:09:27,603 --> 00:09:29,403
in this medieval
monster manual.

169
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:36,577
Just as I feared.

170
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:38,613
Attack-type J.

171
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,915
No! <i>No!</i>

172
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:44,619
Yes! It kills its prey
by sucking out the skeleton,

173
00:09:44,686 --> 00:09:47,455
leaving nothing
but a puddle of flesh.

174
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:48,956
Ew!

175
00:09:49,024 --> 00:09:51,959
Hence, the Latin name
<i>Bonus Vampirus,</i>

176
00:09:52,027 --> 00:09:56,797
or as you non-catholics
would say, the Bone Vampire.

177
00:09:56,865 --> 00:09:59,934
<i>Dios mio.</i>

178
00:10:00,002 --> 00:10:01,602
That's ridiculous!

179
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,437
Mr. Peppy doesn't eat bones.

180
00:10:03,505 --> 00:10:06,707
I raised him on a simple diet of
brussels sprouts and mixed soda.

181
00:10:08,977 --> 00:10:10,678
At least there's
only one of them.

182
00:10:10,746 --> 00:10:12,613
The good news is, they
can't start breeding.

183
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:17,118
The bad news, everyone, is,
the beast reproduces asexually.

184
00:10:17,185 --> 00:10:20,855
A single bone vampire,
left alone with some quiet music

185
00:10:20,923 --> 00:10:23,424
and some bone vampire porn,

186
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:25,826
could produce dozens
of deadly offspring.

187
00:10:25,894 --> 00:10:27,295
That lucky bastard.

188
00:10:27,362 --> 00:10:28,629
I say kill it!

189
00:10:28,697 --> 00:10:30,698
But it loves me, and I love it!

190
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:32,033
Kill them both!

191
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,834
Killing them seems
like a hassle.

192
00:10:33,902 --> 00:10:36,404
Can't we just set it free
to live with its own kind?

193
00:10:36,471 --> 00:10:39,073
Poor, ignorant Leela.

194
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:42,576
The bone vampire is now extinct
on its home planet.

195
00:10:42,644 --> 00:10:44,412
That's perfect.

196
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:48,082
We can reintroduce it to the
wild and repopulate the species.

197
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,785
Yeah, let's do
those Leela things.

198
00:11:01,663 --> 00:11:05,566
Well, buddy,
how do you like your new home?

199
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,437
See, he's happy already.

200
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:11,439
That thing doesn't have
emotions, Fry.

201
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:13,574
Its brain is the size
of a walnut.

202
00:11:13,642 --> 00:11:16,410
So are walnuts, and
they're delicious.

203
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:24,051
I'll miss you, Mr. Peppy,
but you'll be happier here.

204
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:27,021
So go on, go.

205
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:29,890
G-good-bye, Mr. Peppy.

206
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,660
Come on, man, don't do this.

207
00:11:32,728 --> 00:11:34,662
Go on now.

208
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,898
I mean it, don't make this
any harder than it has to be.

209
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:39,633
It's time to let go.

210
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:41,435
Ow!

211
00:11:41,503 --> 00:11:46,273
Thanks, Leela, he just needed
a little extra push.

212
00:11:52,914 --> 00:11:55,649
Come on, Fry, let's go home and

213
00:11:55,717 --> 00:11:58,719
Hold up, there's alcohol
around here somewhere.

243
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:26,607
We just released an endangered
animal back into the wild--

244
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:28,342
a bone vampire.

245

No need to thank us.

Dear God, you brought
back the bone vampire?!

bloody havoc

on our livestock for centuries.

250
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:46,827
Aye, until Maczongo here
shot 'em all

251
00:13:46,895 --> 00:13:48,696
into extinction, he did.

252
00:13:48,763 --> 00:13:52,099
Now we've got more livestock
than we can slaughter.

253
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:55,836
Oh, aye, 'tis a Bonnie time
to be an ignorant villager.

We kinna have no murdering
bone vampires back here.

255
00:13:59,608 --> 00:14:01,775
Kill it afore it puts a bun
in its own oven

256
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:03,911
and repopulates
the bleeding planet.

00:14:03,979 --> 00:14:05,880
No!
Angus is right.

258
00:14:05,947 --> 00:14:07,715
I thought you were named Angus.

259
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:09,350
We're all named Angus.

260
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:11,852
Please, Mr. Peppy won't attack
your livestock.

261
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,955
He's a vegetarian, and he's
not even preachy about it.

262
00:14:15,023 --> 00:14:16,891
Poppycock.

263
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,826
Once he gets the smell of bones,
there'll be no stopping him.

264
00:14:18,894 --> 00:14:22,863
Tonight, Mr. Peppy must die.

265
00:14:22,931 --> 00:14:25,833
Angus, wait, my strictly
platonic friend is right.

266
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:28,636
At least wait a few days
before you decide to kill it.

267
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:30,771
The last time I hesitated,

268
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:33,274
a bone vampire snicked out
me left shin.

269
00:14:35,877 --> 00:14:37,912
Please, just a few days.

270
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:40,047
Well, 'twould give us a chance

271
00:14:40,115 --> 00:14:41,615

272
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:45,819

00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:01,402
Maybe I should go keep
an eye on Mr. Peppy.

277
00:15:01,469 --> 00:15:03,270
Don't worry about Maczongo.

278
00:15:03,338 --> 00:15:04,939
He and I are having
brunch tomorrow.

279
00:15:05,006 --> 00:15:07,308
I'm thinking of wearing this.

280
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,410
It's nice, but there's
still something

281
00:15:09,477 --> 00:15:11,345
I don't like about that guy.

282
00:15:11,413 --> 00:15:13,681
My dad always said you could
tell a lot about a man

283
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:16,317
by the rigidity of his shins.

284
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:25,693
What is it?

285
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:33,801
<i>Lang a muir a Gryffindor-</i>
<i>Slytherin hufflepuff!</i>

286
00:15:33,868 --> 00:15:36,003
It killed little Angus!

287
00:15:36,071 --> 00:15:38,505
They're all dead, and
their bones are gone.

288
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:41,609
This was no accident.

289
00:15:41,676 --> 00:15:44,612
Still think your Mr. Peppy
is harmless, Fry?

290
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,313
He wouldn't do this
in our sleep.

291
00:15:46,381 --> 00:15:48,782
He would not,
could not to a sheep.

292
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,950
The deal is off.

293
00:15:50,018 --> 00:15:51,719
The beast must die.

294
00:15:55,857 --> 00:15:59,393
Ooh, pimpy.

295
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,098
What are we supposed to do,

296
00:16:04,165 --> 00:16:06,400
just sit here and wait
for Mr. Peppy to be killed?

297
00:16:06,468 --> 00:16:08,676
Sounds like a plan.

298
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:12,266
Guess I'll pass the time
by lighting up an El Jerko.

299
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:23,317
Okay, that's it.

300
00:16:23,385 --> 00:16:25,152
I need some air.

301
00:16:31,104 --> 00:16:32,617
Who's there?

302
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:37,496
Hermes, is this one
of your zany practical jokes?

303
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,449
Leela, are you okay?

304
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:51,284
Did you drink too many aquaria?

305
00:16:51,352 --> 00:16:53,596
Look, the bone vampire.

306
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,492
Mr. Peppy attacked me.

307
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,027
Quick, count my bones.

308
00:17:01,095 --> 00:17:02,962
There should be 205.

309
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,503
Okay, that's better.

310
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,172
Keep 'em coming.

311
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,540
I'm sorry, Fry,

312
00:17:13,607 --> 00:17:16,609
but no vegetarian
could have done this.

313
00:17:16,677 --> 00:17:21,548
I know, and as much as I love
Mr. Peppy, I love Leela more.

314
00:17:21,615 --> 00:17:24,084
He has to be...
...Put down.

315
00:17:24,151 --> 00:17:25,618
Aw, don't feel bad.

316
00:17:25,686 --> 00:17:28,555
Major Maczongo
is an experienced hunter.

317
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:32,092
He'll blow Mr. Peppy's head off
as painlessly as possible.

318
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,760
No, not Maczongo.

319
00:17:33,828 --> 00:17:37,530
If anyone is going to kill
Mr. Peppy, it should be me.

320
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,632
Fry, I know you're
upset right now,

321
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,268
but I hope you'll
consider donating

322
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:44,404
the body to science dinner.

00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:50,510
Here, Mr. Peppy.

324
00:17:50,578 --> 00:17:53,046
Mmm, lovely bones.

325
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,447
We've been walking for hours.

326
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:56,583
I hope we can find
our way back.

327
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,052
Don't worry, I left
a trail of bread crumbs.

328
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,056
And I left a trail of cigars.

329
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:06,626
You don't have to do this, Fry.

330
00:18:06,694 --> 00:18:09,329
Mr. Peppy just gave me
a little love concussion.

331
00:18:09,396 --> 00:18:11,564
Thanks, Leela, but
I have no choice.

332
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,534
I can't let my monstrous
deboner get anywhere near you.

333
00:18:14,602 --> 00:18:16,002
There it is!

334
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:20,306
Well, this is it.

335
00:18:20,374 --> 00:18:22,075
You guys wait here.

336
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:25,945
This is going to kill him
more than it does me.

337
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,549
Good-bye, boy.

338
00:18:29,617 --> 00:18:31,518
I'll think of you whenever I sit
on something round.

339
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,995
What's happening?
Did you kill it?

340
00:18:42,062 --> 00:18:44,297
The bloody idiot bloody shot me.

341
00:18:44,365 --> 00:18:45,932
I'm all bloody bloody!

342
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:48,535
Mr. Peppy,

343
00:18:48,602 --> 00:18:50,236
bullets make you talk?

344
00:18:50,304 --> 00:18:52,405
That's not Mr. Peppy.

345
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,277
Jinkies, he Scooby-Dooed us.

346
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,979
Why, Major Maczongo, why?

347
00:19:00,047 --> 00:19:03,983
Oh, it's been 30 years since
last I killed a bone vampire.

348
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:06,753
The villagers dinna idolize me
like they used to.

349
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:09,055
You seemed pretty popular
at the pub.

350
00:19:09,123 --> 00:19:11,391
I work there as a greeter.

351
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,993
Your beast was my chance
to be a hero again,

352
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:15,995
but the damn thing
was a vegetarian,

353
00:19:16,063 --> 00:19:17,964
so I slaughtered
the sheep myself.

354
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,699
But why did you attack me?

355
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:21,100
So I could impress you

356
00:19:21,168 --> 00:19:22,635
by seeking revenge
on the creature.

357
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,071
Us greeters don't
get a lot of action.

358
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:27,540
On paper it seemed like
a win-win situation.

359
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:30,076
Do you realize
what this means, Fry?

360
00:19:30,144 --> 00:19:32,745
Your pet's not dangerous
after all.

361
00:19:32,813 --> 00:19:36,115
I told you Mr. Peppy's
a lover, not a fighter,

362
00:19:36,183 --> 00:19:39,018
like Dwayne "The Rock"
"The Tooth Fairy" Johnson.

363
00:19:43,357 --> 00:19:45,859
Hey, what's
that bone-sucking sound?

364
00:19:48,128 --> 00:19:50,096
It's Mr. Peppy.

365
00:19:50,164 --> 00:19:51,764
I'd know him anywhere.

366
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:54,033
Huh, so apparently
Major Maczongo

367
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:57,070
and Mr. Peppy were each doing
about half the sheep-killing.

368
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:04,143
Why, Mr. Peppy, why?

369
00:20:04,211 --> 00:20:05,345
Ooh, that tickles.

370
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:10,149
Now I really do have
to kill you.

371
00:20:10,217 --> 00:20:12,585
Wait,

372
00:20:12,653 --> 00:20:13,753
don't shoot.

373
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:15,488
The beast is a godsend.

374
00:20:15,556 --> 00:20:17,423
Like I said,
we've more livestock

375
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:19,225
than we can slaughter,

376
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:21,661
but thanks
to this ravenous bogle,

377
00:20:21,729 --> 00:20:23,363
that's nae more a problem.

378
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,764
Angus is right.

379
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:27,233
The cursed thing
even debones 'em,

380
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:30,703
which is perfect for today's
fast-paced, lazy consumer.

381
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:34,127
<i>Dersu uzala yojimbo,</i>
<i>rashomon!</i>

382
00:20:34,252 --> 00:20:35,776
The beast must live!

383

384
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:40,146
You know what the best part is?

385
00:20:40,214 --> 00:20:42,148
From now on,
whenever we're eating

386
00:20:42,216 --> 00:20:44,250
fresh, organic space-meat,

387
00:20:44,318 --> 00:20:46,853
we'll know exactly
where it comes from.

388
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,855
One bucket of

389
00:20:48,923 --> 00:20:52,358
double-fried, triple-salted,
boneless sheep tots, please.

390
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:54,060
What kind of cheese filling
you want in that?

391
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,095
All kinds.

392
00:20:56,163 --> 00:20:57,597
Eh, make it two,

393
00:20:58,587 --> 00:21:00,968
<i>and a small whiskey. Large.</i>
