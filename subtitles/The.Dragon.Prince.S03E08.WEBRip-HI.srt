the Dragonguard, my parents,
failed in their duty.

We went to the... Sun elf place?

he stole some kind of horrible power.

Sorry, is that rude? Is it...

It's just... we met another Skywing elf,

And with that army coming here,

135

- Leave?
- I think... maybe he's right.

Every choice we've made so far has been
to keep Zym safe...

152

so, maybe leaving
is the right thing to do.

00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,747
Okay, I'll tell Ezran and Soren.

What?

158
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:37,089
You and Ezran should take Zym,
but I can't leave.

159
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,092
All of this happened
because my parents ran away,

160
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,887
so I have to stay
and defend the Dragon Queen.

Die?

163
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,601
Probably.

164
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:55,024
But if I die, I'll just be paying the
price they should've paid a long time ago.

165
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,906
Just... remember me, okay?

166
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:07,953
Goodbye, Callum.

167
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,631
Really? So, that's it? Just... goodbye?

168
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:22,384
You're going to stay here
and die out of pride?

169
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,555
It's not pride, Callum!
It's more than that. It goes deeper.

170
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,185
Oh? Do you have a nicer word for it?
Honor? Redemption? It's just pride!

171
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,980
Please, Callum, this is about who I am.

172
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,900
Don't let your parents' mistakes
drag you down.

173
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,653
I know you feel guilty,
but you're not thinking straight!

174

Rayla, you have to let it go!

175
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:48,118
If you think I can just let it go,
then you don't know me at all.

176
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,912
You never did.

Callum, I don't want to talk about it.
I won't change my mind.

194

No, no, no. I did a spell to see
what happened back then,

when Viren took the egg.

196

What are you talking about?
That's impossible.

197

It's true!

198
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,202
That's them.

You really did see them.

201
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,004
When Viren came to destroy the egg,
some of the Dragonguard did run.

202
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:09,426
All of the others have already fled.
You know we can't win this. Come with us!

203
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,221
No, we swore an oath.

204
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,391
If there's any chance,
we must stay and fight!

205
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,227
So long as the egg lives, there is hope.

206
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,272
Then stay and die.
It's a pointless sacrifice.

207
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,734
Wait! Can't you at least take it with you?

208
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,612

You're a Dark Mage.
You must know the magic that egg holds.

It could be a powerful weapon.
Why would you destroy it?

What are you doing?

Don't waste it, mage. Keep the egg alive.

Hmm.

I have just the fate in mind.

235
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,757
[Callum] They didn't run. They fought.

236
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,342
To the end.

237
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,929
They saved the egg!

238
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:03,433
We're here and Zym is alive
all because of them.

239
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,107
What does this mean?

240
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,234
- What should I do?
- I don't know.

241
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,904
But it's your choice. No one else's.

242
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,620
We should decide together.

243
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,253
[Callum] Here's our situation.

244
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:35,883
Viren is coming here for Zym,
and he's leading an army of monsters.

245
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,553
The Dragon Queen is sick,
and we don't know when she'll wake up...

246
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,430
if she'll wake up.

247
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,890
So, we have a choice to make.

248
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,602
We can try to take a stand here,
or we can go on the run,

249
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,145
and protect Zym as long as we can.

250
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,689
[Soren] So, uh... hi.

251
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,483
Uh, I know I'm not really
part of the group,

252
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,444
but can I say something?

[Rayla sighs]

254
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:02,868
[sighs] I've known Viren
longer than anyone here.

255
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,120
I mean, because he's my dad.

256
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:09,917
But it took me a long time to understand
who my dad really is.

257
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:15,214
And it was hard to see,
because I really...

258
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,591
I really looked up to him.

259
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,094
He's smart, and the way he talks,

260
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,347
you really believe
that he's a good person,

261
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:27,017
that everything he does
is to protect his family, his home,

262
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,352
or all of humanity.

263
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,689
He makes you think that
as long as you do what he says,

264
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,983
you must be doing the right thing.

265
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,945
Even when he asks you to do something bad.

266
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,697
Something... evil.

267
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,992
So, the truth is,

268
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,912
someone who wants
you to do horrible things,

269
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,039
and convinces you that they're good,

270
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,958
that's a villain.

271
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,378
My dad... is a villain.

272
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,606
And he's only gonna get more powerful,

273
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,675
and the more powerful he gets,
the more people will listen to him,

274
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,593
and believe him, and follow him.

275
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:06,556
So, maybe we could run,
and we'd be safe for a while, but...

276
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,308
he's not gonna give up.

277
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:13,522
It may seem hopeless,
but our only chance is to fight him here.

278
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,482
While we're all together.

279
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:22,155
The only way to stop this is to look evil
in the face and say, "No more."

280
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,789
I was wrong.

281

You are more than just a big,
dumb lump, aren't you?

282
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,919
Maybe a little more.

283
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,879
So, we stay.
