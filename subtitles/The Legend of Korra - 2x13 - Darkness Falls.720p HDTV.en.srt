1
00:00:00,608 --> 00:00:02,595
Earth...

2
00:00:02,596 --> 00:00:04,595
Fire...

3
00:00:04,596 --> 00:00:05,595
Air...

4
00:00:05,596 --> 00:00:07,595
Water.

5
00:00:07,596 --> 00:00:11,595
Only the Avatar
can master all four elements

6
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:14,596
and bring balance to the world.

7

8
00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:21,595
After 10,000 years,

9
00:00:21,596 --> 00:00:23,595
harmonic convergence
is here again,

10
00:00:23,596 --> 00:00:25,595
and the dark spirit Vaatu
is free.

11
00:00:25,596 --> 00:00:27,595
Tenzin, Bumi, and Kya
have entered the portal

12
00:00:27,596 --> 00:00:29,595
to rescue Jinora's spirit.

13
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:30,595
Asami split from the group

14
00:00:30,596 --> 00:00:33,595
and took
the injured Tonraq to safety.

15
00:00:33,596 --> 00:00:36,595
So it's up to Korra, Mako,
and Bolin to stop Unalaq

16
00:00:36,596 --> 00:00:39,596
before he fuses with Vaatu
and becomes a dark Avatar!

17
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:55,595
Raava, nothing
could stop this moment.

18
00:00:55,596 --> 00:01:00,595
Harmonic convergence
is upon us again.

19
00:01:00,596 --> 00:01:02,595
I'm not going to let you
fuse with Unalaq.

20
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,596
You're going right back
in that prison.

21
00:01:15,596 --> 00:01:17,595
Aah!

22
00:01:17,596 --> 00:01:18,595
Aah!

23
00:01:18,596 --> 00:01:20,595
Don't let Unalaq
back in the spirit world!

24
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:22,596
We're on it!

25
00:01:29,596 --> 00:01:32,595
Jinora.

26
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:34,595
Jinora's spirit,
do you hear me?

27
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:36,595
It's your Uncle Bumi.

28
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,595
Ah, this isn't working.

29
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:41,595
We can't just randomly
wander the spirit world,

30
00:01:41,596 --> 00:01:44,595
call out for Jinora,
and expect to find her!

31
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:47,595
We just need to employ
the simple rules of tracking.

32
00:01:47,596 --> 00:01:49,595
First we locate
her footprints...

33
00:01:49,596 --> 00:01:51,595
Then we follow them.

34
00:01:51,596 --> 00:01:55,595
Do you even know what
spirit footprints look like?

35
00:01:55,596 --> 00:01:58,595
Do spirits even
leave footprints?

36
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:02,595
Face it, your tracking skills
won't work in the spirit world.

37
00:02:02,596 --> 00:02:05,595
Let me try something.

38
00:02:05,596 --> 00:02:06,140
Ommmm...

39
00:02:12,596 --> 00:02:14,595
Jinora is over there.

40
00:02:14,596 --> 00:02:17,595
I feel a lot of spiritual energy
coming from that direction.

41
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,595
We're in the spirit world.

42
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:22,595
There's spiritual energy
in every direction!

43
00:02:22,596 --> 00:02:24,595
Enough!

44
00:02:24,596 --> 00:02:26,595
We can't do this by ourselves.

45
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:28,596
We need a spirit guide.

46
00:02:32,596 --> 00:02:34,596
There!

47
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:38,595
Spirit, hello.

48
00:02:38,596 --> 00:02:40,595
I'm sorry to disturb you,

49
00:02:40,596 --> 00:02:42,595
but I am in need
of your assistance.

50
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:47,595
You dare wake me, human?

51
00:02:47,596 --> 00:02:49,595
Humans in the spirit world

52
00:02:49,596 --> 00:02:53,595
belong in one place only!

53
00:02:55,596 --> 00:02:57,595
- Aah!
- Aah!

54
00:02:57,596 --> 00:02:59,595
Whoaoa-oa!

55
00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:05,596
Oof!

56
00:03:13,596 --> 00:03:15,595
Well, that didn't work.

57
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,595
Now where are we?

58
00:03:17,596 --> 00:03:20,596
We're completely lost.

59
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:47,596
Oh! Uhh!

60
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:54,596
No!

61
00:04:19,596 --> 00:04:20,595
Huh?

62
00:04:31,596 --> 00:04:34,595
I don't know
if we can win this fight.

63
00:04:34,596 --> 00:04:35,595
We don't need to win.

64
00:04:35,596 --> 00:04:37,595
We just need to stop Unalaq

65
00:04:37,596 --> 00:04:39,595
from getting back
in the spirit world.

66
00:04:39,596 --> 00:04:41,596
Huh?

67
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:52,595
We're walking in circles!

68
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:56,595
I've seen that same
spirit mushroom five times!

69
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:57,595
That's not the same mushroom.

70
00:04:57,596 --> 00:04:58,595
Yes, I am.

71
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:01,595
See?
Even it knows we're lost.

72
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:04,595
Oh, sure, listen to a fungus
over your own brother.

73
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,595
What's that?

74
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:08,595
Mushroom, is that you?

75
00:05:08,596 --> 00:05:11,595
Nope.
Wasn't me.

76
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:15,595
Iroh?

77
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:17,595
How...
Where...

78
00:05:17,596 --> 00:05:19,595
It's been so long.

79
00:05:19,596 --> 00:05:21,595
Almost 40 years.

80
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:24,595
It's nice to see you again.

81
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:25,595
How did you know we were here?

82
00:05:25,596 --> 00:05:29,595
My friendly spirit fox
told me you were lost.

83
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,595
I came to show you the way out.

84
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:33,595
Iroh, we are grateful,

85
00:05:33,596 --> 00:05:35,595
but we're not
looking for the way out...

86
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:37,595
we're looking for my daughter.

87
00:05:37,596 --> 00:05:41,595
I'm sorry to hear that,
but you shouldn't be here.

88
00:05:41,596 --> 00:05:42,595
Vaatu has escaped,

89
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:44,595
and darkness
threatens to take over.

90
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:47,595
I'm not leaving
until I find Jinora.

91
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:49,595
I understand.

92
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:51,595
But I beg you to be careful.

93
00:05:51,596 --> 00:05:54,595
If you travel too deep
into the spirit world,

94
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:56,595
you could end up in a place

95
00:05:56,596 --> 00:05:59,596
where only the lost
will ever find you.

96
00:06:08,596 --> 00:06:12,595
A place where only the lost
can find you...

97
00:06:12,596 --> 00:06:13,595
That's it!

98
00:06:13,596 --> 00:06:15,595
I know where to find Jinora!

99
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:46,595
I'm locking you away

100
00:06:46,596 --> 00:06:49,596
for another 10,000 years,
Vaatu!

101
00:07:00,596 --> 00:07:03,595
Unalaq?

102
00:07:03,596 --> 00:07:06,596
Are you out there?

103
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:10,596
He must have gone home?

104
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:15,595
Hello,
my feeble turtle-duck.

105
00:07:15,596 --> 00:07:17,595
Aah!

106
00:07:17,596 --> 00:07:18,596
Huh?

107
00:07:30,596 --> 00:07:33,596
Don't let them escape
this time.

108
00:07:36,596 --> 00:07:40,595
Are you sure this
is the best way to find Jinora?

109
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:43,596
Trust me.

110
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:47,595
Hey, you, spirit...
wake up!

111
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:48,595
You again?

112
00:08:05,596 --> 00:08:08,595
I thought we were going to be
taken to a prison.

113
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:10,595
This is a prison.

114
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:14,595
Welcome to the fog
of lost souls.

115
00:08:14,596 --> 00:08:18,595
You will never escape.

116
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,595
Aah!

117
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,556
Stop!

118
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,596
No!

119
00:10:09,596 --> 00:10:12,596
We are now one.

120
00:10:13,965 --> 00:10:17,621
Now a new era for spirits
and humans will begin,

121
00:10:17,622 --> 00:10:20,621
and I will lead them all
as the new Avatar.

122
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:24,622
Well, I'm the old Avatar,
and my era's not over yet.

123
00:10:29,622 --> 00:10:33,621
What kind of prison
doesn't have any bars or walls?

124
00:10:33,622 --> 00:10:35,621
We could walk
right out of here.

125
00:10:35,622 --> 00:10:39,621
The fog of lost souls
is a spirit prison for humans.

126
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:41,621
I read about it
in an ancient text.

127
00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:44,621
The fog is actually a spirit...

128
00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:47,621
That infects your mind
and slowly drives you mad,

129
00:10:47,622 --> 00:10:51,621
imprisoning you
in your own darkest memories.

130
00:10:51,622 --> 00:10:53,621
How long can you
be trapped in here?

131
00:10:53,622 --> 00:10:56,621
I am Zhao the Conqueror!

132
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:57,621
I am the Moonslayer!

133
00:10:57,622 --> 00:11:00,621
I will capture the Avatar!

134
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:02,289
I am Zhao the Conqueror!

135
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,373
I am the Moonslayer!

136
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:06,621
I will capture the Avatar!

137
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:09,621
Hopefully we're not trapped
in here as long as that guy.

138
00:11:09,622 --> 00:11:12,621
You!
You're him!

139
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:13,621
The last airbender!

140
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:15,621
Ah!
No!

141
00:11:15,622 --> 00:11:17,621
Get off me!

142
00:11:17,622 --> 00:11:21,621
You've grown...
But I will still defeat you!

143
00:11:21,622 --> 00:11:23,622
Ah!
Ohh!

144
00:11:25,622 --> 00:11:28,621
Come back, Avatar!
Face me!

145
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:30,621
I am Zhao the Conqueror!

146
00:11:30,622 --> 00:11:33,621
I will capture you!

147
00:11:33,622 --> 00:11:36,621
Victory will be mine!

148
00:11:36,622 --> 00:11:37,621
If we stay together,

149
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:41,622
we'll find Jinora
and make it out of this fog.

150
00:12:20,622 --> 00:12:23,622
Aah!

151
00:12:34,622 --> 00:12:37,621
Give in.
Your time is over.

152
00:12:43,622 --> 00:12:46,621
Korra, this fight is not over.

153
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:49,621
Raava...

154
00:12:49,622 --> 00:12:51,621
Vaatu cannot win.

155
00:12:51,622 --> 00:12:56,621
Do not give in
to 10,000 years of darkness.

156
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:58,622
You are the Avatar.

157
00:13:02,622 --> 00:13:05,622
Aah!

158
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:13,622
You cannot win!

159
00:13:21,622 --> 00:13:24,621
Jinora!

160
00:13:24,622 --> 00:13:26,621
Jinora!

161
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:27,621
- Wait a second.
- What?

162
00:13:27,622 --> 00:13:29,621
Do you hear something?

163
00:13:29,622 --> 00:13:32,621
Yes.
They're all around us.

164
00:13:32,622 --> 00:13:35,621
The cannibals,
they're everywhere.

165
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:38,621
Bumi, you must
focus your mind right now.

166
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:40,621
There are no cannibals.

167
00:13:40,622 --> 00:13:41,621
Yes, there are!

168
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:44,621
They're gonna eat
every last one of us!

169
00:13:44,622 --> 00:13:46,621
Who are you two?!

170
00:13:46,622 --> 00:13:49,621
Kya, we're your brothers.

171
00:13:49,622 --> 00:13:52,621
You must remember
before the fog infects you.

172
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:55,621
No, you are just a vision.
I have no family.

173
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:57,621
You can't tie me down!

174
00:13:57,622 --> 00:13:59,621
They're closing in!

175
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:02,621
I gotta get outta here!
Aah!

176
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:04,622
- Aah!
- No!

177
00:14:07,622 --> 00:14:09,621
Bumi! Kya!

178
00:14:09,622 --> 00:14:11,622
Come back!

179
00:14:20,622 --> 00:14:23,621
Please, let us out.

180
00:14:23,622 --> 00:14:26,621
His groveling is pathetic.

181
00:14:26,622 --> 00:14:29,621
But I do enjoy
the sweet scent of desperation.

182
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:30,621
Come on!

183
00:14:30,622 --> 00:14:33,621
Your dad has become
an evil monster.

184
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,621
He's trying to bring on
eternal darkness!

185
00:14:35,622 --> 00:14:37,621
Why would you protect someone

186
00:14:37,622 --> 00:14:39,621
who doesn't care
about you at all?

187
00:14:39,622 --> 00:14:42,621
Father <i>was</i> going
to let me expire

188
00:14:42,622 --> 00:14:45,621
when we tried to open
the northern portal...

189
00:14:45,622 --> 00:14:47,621
Perhaps we should
rethink our position.

190
00:14:47,622 --> 00:14:49,621
- Yes!
- No.

191
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,621
Don't listen to him.

192
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:53,621
His words
are poisoning your mind.

193
00:14:57,622 --> 00:14:59,621
What's with this
outburst of emotion?

194
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:02,621
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

195
00:15:02,622 --> 00:15:04,621
It's just so sad...

196
00:15:04,622 --> 00:15:07,621
That I'll never get to be
with you again.

197
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:08,621
What?

198
00:15:08,622 --> 00:15:11,621
Explain yourself further.

199
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:13,621
Eska, I've always loved you,

200
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:15,621
and I've always
wanted to be with you...

201
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:17,621
But now that
the world is ending,

202
00:15:17,622 --> 00:15:21,621
I'm never gonna
get that chance.

203
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:23,621
We could have been together,

204
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,621
but you left me at the altar.

205
00:15:25,622 --> 00:15:27,621
I was scared!

206
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:30,621
I was scared
of my true feelings for you.

207
00:15:30,622 --> 00:15:33,621
I should have never left you!
I'm sorry.

208
00:15:33,622 --> 00:15:35,621
And I'm sorry that we'll never
have a chance to rekindle

209
00:15:35,622 --> 00:15:38,621
the dying ember
that was our love into a...

210
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:41,621
Big fire of love flames.

211
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,621
You'll never defeat my father.

212
00:15:58,622 --> 00:16:01,621
But should you survive,

213
00:16:01,622 --> 00:16:04,622
perhaps we can spend
eternal darkness together.

214
00:16:07,622 --> 00:16:10,621
Wow, that was
the best acting I've ever seen.

215
00:16:10,622 --> 00:16:11,621
You completely fooled her!

216
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:14,622
Yeah, right, that...
that was acting.

217
00:16:18,622 --> 00:16:21,622
They will certainly perish.

218
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:05,076
I must stay focused.

219
00:18:05,077 --> 00:18:06,866
Remember who you are, Tenzin.

220
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:08,866
You are the son of Avatar Aang.

221
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:10,252
You are the hope

222
00:18:10,278 --> 00:18:12,417
for future generations
of airbenders.

223
00:18:12,434 --> 00:18:15,493
The fate of the world
rests on your shoulders.

224
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,867
But what if I fail?

225
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:22,866
Then your father's hope
for the future dies with you.

226
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:23,866
I can't fail!

227
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:24,866
You will.

228
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:26,866
Aah!
Stop it!

229
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:29,866
I am the son of Avatar Aang.

230
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:32,867
I am the hope for future
generations of airbenders.

231
00:18:32,868 --> 00:18:36,866
I am the son of Avatar Aang!

232
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:38,867
Hello, my son.

233
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:43,866
Dad, I've failed you.

234
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:46,866
I am no spiritual leader,

235
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:49,866
and I've let the world down.

236
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:51,866
I'll never be the man you were.

237
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:53,866
You are right.

238
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:55,866
You are trying to hold on

239
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:58,866
to a false perception
of yourself.

240
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:02,866
You are not me,
and you should not be me.

241
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:05,867
You are Tenzin.

242
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:16,866
I am not a reflection
of my father.

243
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:17,866
I am Tenzin.

244
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:19,867
I am Tenzin.

245
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:31,867
Jinora!

246
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:53,866
Ah...

247
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:55,866
What happened?

248
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:58,866
I think our brother saved us.

249
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:00,866
Dad.

250
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:01,866
You're going to be okay,
sweetie.

251
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,866
I'm here.
What happened?

252
00:20:04,867 --> 00:20:05,866
The last thing I remember

253
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:08,866
is dark spirits taking me away.

254
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:10,866
You were trapped
in the fog of lost souls,

255
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:13,866
but I wasn't going
to let you stay there.

256
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:16,867
I'm so happy to see you, dad.

257
00:20:25,867 --> 00:20:27,866
Korra!

258
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:29,867
He's got the light spirit!

259
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:40,867
Aah!

260
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:14,867
Aah!

261
00:21:50,867 --> 00:21:52,866
The world's in trouble.

262
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:54,866
What are you talking about?
How do you know?

263
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:55,866
I can feel it.

264
00:21:55,867 --> 00:21:58,866
- What happened?
- It's Korra.

265
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:00,866
This light spirit

266
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:02,866
will guide you
out of the spirit world.

267
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:05,867
I have to go help.

268
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,867
Jinora, wait!

269
00:22:37,867 --> 00:22:39,866
Now...

270
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:45,867
10,000 years of darkness
begins!

271
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:58,867
Aah!

272
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:06,658
