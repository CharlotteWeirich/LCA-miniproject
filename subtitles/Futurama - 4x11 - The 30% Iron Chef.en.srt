00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:09,449  X1:263 X2:455 Y1:494 Y2:516
30% Iron Chef

2
00:00:35,253 --> 00:00:40,327  X1:086 X2:636 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>Welcome back. Our next guest has taught</i>
<i>the world to cook for over 20 years.</i>

3
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:43,929  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>But apparently my wife hasn 't</i>
<i>been listening.</i>

4
00:00:44,093 --> 00:00:46,891  X1:239 X2:480 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>- Funny.</i>
<i>- I will destroy her!</i>

5
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:52,810  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:061 Y2:121
<i>And now, extend a formulaic greeting</i>
<i>to master chef Elzar.</i>

6
00:00:55,173 --> 00:01:00,531  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>So, what will you be cooking for Morbo</i>
<i>to devour with his mighty jaws?</i>

7
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:04,891  X1:136 X2:578 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>I'm gonna whip you up a nice,</i>
<i>unnameable horror from beyond...</i>

8
00:01:05,053 --> 00:01:07,248  X1:206 X2:508 Y1:061 Y2:087
<i>... with mango chutney.</i>

9
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:14,403  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Pathetic humans,</i>
<i>prepare to write down the recipe!</i>

10
00:01:17,053 --> 00:01:20,284  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:061 Y2:127
What's with the pots and pans?
Building a wife?

11
00:01:20,453 --> 00:01:26,847  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:061 Y2:127
Part of one. Meantime, I'm cooking up
a tasty Sunday brunch for my friends.

12
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:42,205  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:061 Y2:122
Brunch. Right. I'd better warn...
Tell... Warn-tell the others.

13
00:01:42,413 --> 00:01:44,483  X1:278 X2:437 Y1:061 Y2:087
Okey-dokey.

14
00:01:52,093 --> 00:01:53,162  X1:326 X2:389 Y1:495 Y2:516
Nice.

15
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:57,804  X1:153 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:516
Yes. It's a perfect scale model
of the universe's largest bottle.

16
00:01:58,013 --> 00:02:02,245  X1:171 X2:543 Y1:451 Y2:516
I put a tiny spaceship inside
to keep it from being boring.

17
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:08,852  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:451 Y2:516
Get! For the last time, Zoidberg,
look with your eyes, not your claws!

18
00:02:09,053 --> 00:02:11,726  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:451 Y2:516
Brace yourselves.
Bender is making us brunch.

19
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:14,925  X1:231 X2:484 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Oh, boy!
- Oh, God, my tract!

20
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:18,443  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:453 Y2:516
He's proud of his cooking.
If we don't eat, he'll be crushed.

21
00:02:18,613 --> 00:02:22,367  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:516
Don't panic. If we can
get to the ship, we'll fly north...

22
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:24,848  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:490 Y2:516
...and hide under the polar icecaps.

23
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:27,692  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Good idea!
- What's the holdup?

24
00:02:28,093 --> 00:02:29,765  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:490 Y2:516
Fleeing somewhere?

25
00:02:29,973 --> 00:02:33,886  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:451 Y2:516
With you blocking the only
escape route? Don't be silly.

26
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:39,884  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:516
In that case, brunch is served. Let's
go, move it out! Stop crying, Leela.

27
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:45,364  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Zoidberg, are you coming?
- Sure. Me.

28
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:49,768  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:455 Y2:516
- I don't want you touching that thing!
- I know that.

29
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,803  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:490 Y2:516
Surrender your mysteries to Zoidberg.

30
00:03:01,573 --> 00:03:07,842  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
Oh, no, professor will hit me! But if
Zoidberg fixes it, then perhaps gifts.

31
00:03:14,013 --> 00:03:15,332  X1:317 X2:399 Y1:495 Y2:516
What?

32
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:20,012  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:489 Y2:516
I've personalized each of your meals.

33
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:25,003  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:450 Y2:516
For example, Amy, you're cute,
so I baked you a pony.

34
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:29,331  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:451 Y2:516
Come on, eat!
I slaved all day over a filthy stove.

35
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,607  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:495 Y2:516
This is terrible!

36
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:37,686  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:456 Y2:516
Good thing I secretly installed
this wormhole in the table.

37
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:47,322  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Where does the other end come out?
- You know, I'm not quite sure.

38
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,053  X1:301 X2:415 Y1:495 Y2:516
Dear me.

39
00:03:55,613 --> 00:04:00,209  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:451 Y2:516
The pie is ready.
You guys like swarms of things, right?

40
00:04:01,493 --> 00:04:05,327  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:516
Casual hello. It's me, Zoidberg.
Act naturally.

41
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:10,125  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:490 Y2:516
Get off of me! Stop!

42
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:14,451  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:451 Y2:516
How interesting, Dr. Zoidberg.
Do go on.

43
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:20,402  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:451 Y2:516
Check out the palm tree.
It gets sick when I cook brunch.

44
00:04:20,573 --> 00:04:26,808  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:450 Y2:516
How's that for coincidence, professor,
with all your precious science?

45
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:41,809  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:455 Y2:516
I don't want to hurt his feelings,
but this tastes better as vomit.

46
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:46,006  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's unbearable. What would it cost
to get my tongue removed?

47
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:19,567  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:495 Y2:516
And this time I mean it!

48
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:43,644  X1:123 X2:591 Y1:451 Y2:516
Who am I kidding? It was stupid
of me to dream of becoming a chef.

49
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:48,807  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:516
I don't have what it takes,
and nothing can change that.

50
00:05:52,893 --> 00:05:55,965  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:455 Y2:516
Then it's settled.
Elzar will teach me to cook!

51
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:58,129  X1:259 X2:455 Y1:490 Y2:516
Absolutely not.

52
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:03,611  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:451 Y2:516
- But I watch your show. You owe me.
- I owe you nothing!

53
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:07,169  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:450 Y2:516
One, your antenna's in my crotch.
Also, I hate you.

54
00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:10,883  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:489 Y2:516
And finally, you can't cook for squat.

55
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:13,927  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:451 Y2:516
- What was the first one?
- I hate you.

56
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:18,490  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:451 Y2:516
- I thought that was number two.
- I knocked it up a notch. Bam!

57
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:22,970  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:489 Y2:516
I'll never recombobulate this ship.

58
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:27,604  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:456 Y2:516
When the professor finds out,
he'll tear me a new cloaca!

59
00:06:29,293 --> 00:06:33,332  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:495 Y2:516
Wait. What would the robot do?

60
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,688  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:495 Y2:516
Frame someone.

61
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:37,485  X1:296 X2:420 Y1:490 Y2:516
What up?

62
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:58,091  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's over. My dream of being a chef
is deader than the cat I'm sitting on.

63
00:06:58,253 --> 00:07:02,246  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:455 Y2:516
Gus, let's give a friendly welcome
to this new robo.

64
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:06,452  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:454 Y2:516
- What did you call me?
- A "robo". You know, a robot hobo.

65
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:11,812  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Okay. I thought you said "romo".
- No offense intended, my filthy friend.

66
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,727  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:451 Y2:516
In fact, why not join us
and ride the space rails?

67
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:37,612  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:516
Get ready. We's gonna jump off
at that switching prism.

68
00:07:37,853 --> 00:07:42,722  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:450 Y2:516
We're going nearly the speed of light,
so roll when you land.

69
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:59,772  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:451 Y2:516
Welcome to Bumbase Alpha,
biggest hobo jungle in the quadrant.

70
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:03,926  X1:110 X2:604 Y1:450 Y2:516
I've seen bigger.
Wait, I'm thinking of Eugene, Oregon.

71
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:18,882  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:456 Y2:516
Wait, a pie with hobo-lifting aroma?
Who baked it?

72
00:08:19,093 --> 00:08:22,244  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:451 Y2:516
Helmut Spargle.
He used to be the greatest chef.

73
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:25,809  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:451 Y2:516
His restaurant was so high-toned,
to get reservations...

74
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:30,205  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:451 Y2:516
...you had to create a parallel
universe, where you had reservations!

75
00:08:30,373 --> 00:08:33,171  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:456 Y2:516
I once ate there, back
when I was a senator.

76
00:08:33,373 --> 00:08:38,128  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:450 Y2:516
Yo, Spargle, if you're such a great
cook, how'd you end up in this dump?

77
00:08:38,293 --> 00:08:41,922  X1:096 X2:619 Y1:490 Y2:516
Ages ago, I was the host of a TV show:

78
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:45,409  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:451 Y2:516
Down-Home Country Kitchen
<i>mit</i> Helmut Spargle.

79
00:08:45,573 --> 00:08:49,691  X1:116 X2:604 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>One day, the Extreme Soda Company</i>
<i>that sponsored the show...</i>

80
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:54,131  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>...decided it was too old-fashioned.</i>
- Spargle, you're fired.

81
00:08:54,293 --> 00:09:00,482  X1:094 X2:621 Y1:451 Y2:516
We need a chef who attracts a younger,
more extreme cooking-show viewer.

82
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:03,326  X1:237 X2:479 Y1:454 Y2:516
- Elzar!
- Get lost, old man.

83
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:06,446  X1:272 X2:441 Y1:495 Y2:516
<i>Mein</i> soufflé!

84
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:11,292  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:451 Y2:516
Elzar had been seduced
by the dark side of cooking.

85
00:09:11,453 --> 00:09:15,844  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:451 Y2:516
Cilantro, mango salsa,
raspberry vinaigrette.

86
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,765  X1:270 X2:444 Y1:495 Y2:516
That twizzler.

87
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:21,807  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:451 Y2:516
As for me, I went temporarily insane
and wound up here...

88
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:24,407  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:490 Y2:516
...making pies out of shoes.

89
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:28,606  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:516
My story's like yours,
only interesting. It involves robots.

90
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:33,091  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:451 Y2:516
That jerk, Elzar, ruined my dream
of being a chef too.

91
00:09:33,293 --> 00:09:38,321  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516
Interesting. You wish to cook, but as
a robot, you have no sense of taste.

92
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:41,485  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's so unfair.
I have eight other senses...

93
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:46,602  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:453 Y2:516
...but I'd trade them all,
even smision, to be able to taste!

94
00:09:46,773 --> 00:09:49,845  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:495 Y2:516
Without the distraction of taste...

95
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:53,323  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:451 Y2:516
...your mind is free to touch
the Zen of pure flavor.

96
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:56,331  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:456 Y2:516
- You could be the greatest chef!
- I could?

97
00:09:56,493 --> 00:10:00,532  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:456 Y2:516
Just as Beethoven was a great composer
because he was deaf!

98
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,805  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:456 Y2:516
Or how Rembrandt was blind
and had wooden hands!

99
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:06,533  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:451 Y2:516
Bender, hear me well.
I shall train you.

100
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:10,083  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:451 Y2:516
First, forget everything
you know of cooking.

101
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,808  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:495 Y2:516
Done.

102
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:45,889  X1:219 X2:495 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's right, Ricardo.
A ship in a bottle.

103
00:10:46,053 --> 00:10:49,841  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:450 Y2:516
What's that?
Well, hang on, I'll look.

104
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:02,686  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:516
I've gathered
you in the accusing parlor...

105
00:11:02,893 --> 00:11:06,681  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:451 Y2:516
...because one of you
is a miniature-ship wrecker.

106
00:11:06,893 --> 00:11:08,372  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:489 Y2:516
I'm acting astonished.

107
00:11:08,573 --> 00:11:14,808  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:451 Y2:516
Certain clues suggest the culprit is
none other than our own Philip J. Fry.

108
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,052  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:061 Y2:121
- What?
- It was a brilliant scheme...

109
00:11:18,213 --> 00:11:22,491  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:451 Y2:516
...but you made one fatal mistake:
leaving this confession note!

110
00:11:24,573 --> 00:11:27,371  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Scoundrel.
- I don't remember any of that...

111
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:29,603  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:489 Y2:516
...but I can't defend myself.

112
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:35,251  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:455 Y2:516
I have no choice but to charge you
the full cost of the materials. $ 1 0.

113
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:37,762  X1:267 X2:447 Y1:490 Y2:516
There you go.

114
00:11:40,973 --> 00:11:44,124  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:495 Y2:516
What have I done?

115
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:50,244  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:451 Y2:516
Your training is complete,
little dessert spoon.

116
00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:54,605  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:451 Y2:516
Just as he who wishes to be world
chess champion must win at least...

117
00:11:54,773 --> 00:12:00,166  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:451 Y2:516
...one game of chess, so must
you serve at least one edible meal.

118
00:12:00,373 --> 00:12:02,841  X1:126 X2:588 Y1:490 Y2:516
Succeed and I shall reveal to you...

119
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:07,211  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:451 Y2:516
...the age-old secret
of perfect flavor.

120
00:12:09,773 --> 00:12:12,890  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Slop's on.
- Fine-looking eats.

121
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,922  X1:250 X2:465 Y1:451 Y2:516
- It is acceptable.
- All right!

122
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:36,203  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:450 Y2:516
Another thing I'm great at!
Wait, why'd you stop eating, master?

123
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:39,405  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:451 Y2:516
Because my stomach
is about to explode.

124
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:45,443  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:456 Y2:516
- What? My dinner killed you? Man!
- It hurts.

125
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:51,570  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:451 Y2:516
Stay confident. The important thing
is, you defeat Elzar after I am gone.

126
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:54,566  X1:152 X2:562 Y1:490 Y2:516
And using this, you cannot fail.

127
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:58,088  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:495 Y2:516
A diamond vial of Mrs. Dash?

128
00:12:58,293 --> 00:13:00,727  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:490 Y2:516
No, it is the essence of pure flavor.

129
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:06,126  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:451 Y2:516
A few drops will cause the inner
perfection of any dish to blossom forth.

130
00:13:08,213 --> 00:13:10,488  X1:247 X2:467 Y1:490 Y2:516
There goes my...

131
00:13:10,653 --> 00:13:12,325  X1:321 X2:396 Y1:495 Y2:516
...life!

132
00:13:15,653 --> 00:13:17,450  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:489 Y2:516
I'll avenge you, master!

133
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:21,362  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:456 Y2:516
I swear, in the presence
of these drunken bums...

134
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:24,809  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:495 Y2:516

135
00:13:25,093 --> 00:13:29,530  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm not drunk. I'm mentally ill.
But I likes what, what you said.

136
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:37,362  X1:174 X2:540 Y1:450 Y2:516
Elzar, I'm a walking pile
of your unfinished business!

137
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:41,851  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Why, you...
- Helmut Spargle has a message for you!

138
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:45,762  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:489 Y2:516
He says, "I'm dead."

139
00:13:45,973 --> 00:13:48,931  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:455 Y2:516
Spargle? What'd he do,
bland himself to death?

140
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:54,526  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:451 Y2:516
No, he was eating some food I made and
by coincidence, his stomach exploded.

141
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:57,127  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:489 Y2:516
Now I'm here to avenge him!

142
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:03,249  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Seems you're the one who killed him.
- Maybe so, but you're his sworn enemy!

143
00:14:03,413 --> 00:14:07,486  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:456 Y2:516
I challenge you to a battle
of the chefs!

144
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:09,282  X1:279 X2:435 Y1:495 Y2:516
Scandalous!

145
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:14,726  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:516
We'll meet on the ancient televised
battleground of Kitchen Coliseum.

146
00:14:14,893 --> 00:14:18,602  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:456 Y2:516

147
00:14:18,813 --> 00:14:22,931  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:454 Y2:516

I'm 30% iron.

149
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:30,531  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:456 Y2:516

167
00:15:56,853 --> 00:16:01,608  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:061 Y2:126

00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,405  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:456 Y2:516
It is found in a small kitchen
with friends.

206
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:13,173  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:495 Y2:516
So I decline the title of Iron Cook...

207
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:18,532  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:451 Y2:516
...and accept only the lesser title
of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up.

208
00:19:18,693 --> 00:19:21,605  X1:096 X2:619 Y1:490 Y2:516
Also, it comes with double prize money.

209
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:29,885  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:451 Y2:516
Wait. Everyone must know.
I broke the professor's bottled ship!

210
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:35,452  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:451 Y2:516
And what is worse,
I framed my dearest friend, Fry!

211
00:19:36,293 --> 00:19:41,447  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
I can never repay him his $ 1 0, so I
must take the only honorable path...

212
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:44,332  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:490 Y2:516
...what with the killing myself.

213
00:19:48,173 --> 00:19:50,687  X1:243 X2:472 Y1:490 Y2:516
Here I go already!

214
00:19:53,213 --> 00:19:57,001  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:494 Y2:516
That sword cost $5000!

215
00:19:57,933 --> 00:19:59,685  X1:296 X2:419 Y1:490 Y2:516
Fry did it.

216
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:07,247  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:450 Y2:516
And that's how I defeated Elzar,
thanks to Spargle's magic liquid.

217
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:11,048  X1:120 X2:594 Y1:451 Y2:516
Yes, we were there,
and we just watched it again on TV.

218
00:20:11,773 --> 00:20:15,163  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:493 Y2:516
Let me see that vial, Bender.

219
00:20:22,253 --> 00:20:25,086  X1:155 X2:559 Y1:451 Y2:516
Good Lord!
According to the spectrolizer...

220
00:20:25,253 --> 00:20:30,452  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:450 Y2:516
...Spargle's magic ingredient was water!
Ordinary water.

221
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:36,564  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:451 Y2:516
So the real gift Spargle gave you
was the confidence to be your best.

222
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:43,081  X1:100 X2:615 Y1:451 Y2:516
Yes, ordinary water, laced with nothing
more than a few spoonfuls of LSD.

223
00:20:43,253 --> 00:20:47,405  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:451 Y2:516
The important thing is, by my
standards, I won fair and square.

224
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:52,733  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:451 Y2:516
Now, who wants brunch
cooked with plenty of "confidence"?

225
00:20:52,893 --> 00:20:54,611  X1:312 X2:403 Y1:455 Y2:516
- I'm in!
- I do!
