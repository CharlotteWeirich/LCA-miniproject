1
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:01,985
Earth.

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:03,433
Fire.

3
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:05,063
Air.

4
00:00:05,078 --> 00:00:06,787
Water.

5
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:10,299
And bring balance to the world.

6
00:00:13,322 --> 00:00:15,988

7
00:00:16,277 --> 00:00:19,180
Airbenders are mysteriously disappearing
in Ba Sing Se,

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,300
including Kai.

9
00:00:20,481 --> 00:00:22,377
The Earth Queen denied any
knowledge of the events.

10
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,097
But Korra refused to give up
the search.

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,015
Meanwhile, Mako and Bolin
met their long lost grandmother

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,505
who told them that Dai Li agents
have been rounding up airbenders

13
00:00:29,524 --> 00:00:30,575
for the Queen's army.

14
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:33,735
And other prison on the North,
Tonraq and Lord Zuko prepare

15
00:00:33,747 --> 00:00:35,286
for Zaheer's imminent attack.

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,772
_
_

17
00:01:01,776 --> 00:01:03,610
Did you see Zaheer?

18
00:01:03,612 --> 00:01:06,863
The only thing I saw
was a snowstorm heading our way.

19
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:14,287
That's not a snowstorm.
That's him.

20
00:01:38,145 --> 00:01:42,649
I put you away once, Zaheer,
and I'm going to do it again.

21
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:37,871
Ming-Hua.

22
00:02:37,873 --> 00:02:40,924
Let's get you out of here.

23
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,443
We could have just taken
the elevator, show-off.

24
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,796
I've waited 13 years
to feel this warm.

25
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:52,412
I thought
I'd never see you again.

26
00:03:52,414 --> 00:03:54,864
I never doubted.

27
00:03:57,334 --> 00:04:00,003
Really? Right now?

28
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,294
I got 'em!

29
00:04:08,296 --> 00:04:10,463
These passports should get you
into the upper ring.

30
00:04:10,465 --> 00:04:15,018
Awesome! Tu, you're the best
cousin a guy could have.

31
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,353
And my other cousins as well.

32
00:04:17,355 --> 00:04:20,190
Yeah.
Yeah, you're all the best.

33
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:23,276
Thanks.
I know this wasn't easy.

34
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:26,529
It's such a shame
you two must leave so soon.

35
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:28,114
I wish we could stay.

36
00:04:28,116 --> 00:04:29,649
But if it's true The Earth Queen

37
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:31,818
is forcing airbenders
into her army,

38
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,620
we have to do something
about it.

39
00:04:33,622 --> 00:04:37,123
I love you both.
Come visit again.

40
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,908
We will, grandma.

41
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,244
I love you too, grandma.

42
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:45,081
And Chow and Tu

43
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,667
and Meng-Meng
and Chow Jr.

44
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:50,970
And there he is,
Big Tee and Little... Little Tee,

45
00:04:50,972 --> 00:04:54,924
and Medium Yu and... and...
and what was your name again?

46
00:04:56,918 --> 00:04:59,219
I know that earth queen
is lying to me.

47
00:04:59,221 --> 00:05:02,555
I can tell by that stupid
little queeny smirk of hers!

48
00:05:02,557 --> 00:05:04,474
And I can't believe
I helped her.

49
00:05:04,476 --> 00:05:07,310
I should have known
she was using me!

50
00:05:08,513 --> 00:05:10,063
Whoa! Hey!

51
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:11,397
I think I could use a break.

52
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,767
You letting off steam
is starting to...

53
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:15,518
Hurt... A lot.

54
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,686
Sorry.

55
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:19,773
Mako! Bolin!

56
00:05:19,775 --> 00:05:21,441
You're okay.

57
00:05:21,443 --> 00:05:25,612
Where have you been?

58
00:05:25,614 --> 00:05:26,913
We chased Kai...

59
00:05:26,915 --> 00:05:28,865
Train... Slipped away...

60
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:31,417
Lower ring... Slept in trash pile...

61
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:32,786
Met our family...

62
00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:35,288
Grandma, tears...
Mako scarf...

63
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,791
Earth queen lying.

64
00:05:37,793 --> 00:05:39,292
Mm.

65
00:05:39,294 --> 00:05:40,760
Can you interpret that?

66
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:43,463
The Earth Queen's been
secretly taking airbenders

67
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:45,215
and forcing them into her army.

68
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:48,434
She was lying.
I knew it!

69
00:05:48,436 --> 00:05:50,470
I swear,
the next time I see her...

70
00:05:50,472 --> 00:05:52,355
It's the queen.

71
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,145
Quick, Pabu, shirt!

72
00:05:59,147 --> 00:06:02,065
I know. Sorry.
Kinda sweaty.

73
00:06:03,317 --> 00:06:06,653
Good, you're here.
Gun, tell her the news.

74
00:06:06,655 --> 00:06:09,289
We've received word
from the Yang province.

75
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,574
There have been reports
of airbenders there.

76
00:06:11,576 --> 00:06:13,409
Wonderful, isn't it?

77
00:06:13,411 --> 00:06:15,461
It's the very thing
you've been looking for.

78
00:06:15,463 --> 00:06:17,330
Thank you.

79
00:06:17,332 --> 00:06:20,667
That is just
the most wonderful news, ever.

80
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:21,918
Yay.

81
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,589
So I assume you and your...
Friends here

82
00:06:26,591 --> 00:06:28,091
will be leaving immediately.

83
00:06:28,093 --> 00:06:31,144
Ahhh, ah-choo!

84
00:06:31,146 --> 00:06:32,679
Ah-choo!

85
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:34,564
Ahhhh, ah-choo!

86
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:38,685
Is there an animal
in my presence?

87
00:06:38,687 --> 00:06:40,019
No, your majesty.

88
00:06:40,021 --> 00:06:42,322
I would never allow
an animal near you.

89
00:06:42,324 --> 00:06:46,359
Ah-choo!
Ahh, ahh, ah-choo!

90
00:06:46,361 --> 00:06:51,998
If I find one within 50 feet
of me, it's your head!

91
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,668
Anyway, if you need
any assistance packing,

92
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,086
let gun know.

93
00:06:57,088 --> 00:07:00,123
He'll see to it that you are
on your way by evening.

94
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,792
Uh, this evening?

95
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:05,011
I'm not sure
about leaving so soon.

96
00:07:05,013 --> 00:07:07,213
Because our airship
is having engine trouble.

97
00:07:07,215 --> 00:07:09,799
It'll take me until tomorrow
to finish the repairs.

98
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:14,804
Ahh, ahh, ah-choo!
Ah-choo!

99
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:16,222
Ah-choo!

100
00:07:16,224 --> 00:07:19,475
Thanks for buying us some time.

101
00:07:19,477 --> 00:07:21,561
I can't believe The Earth Queen

102
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:22,946
is conscripting airbenders.

103
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:25,698
Those people should not
be forced to join an army.

104
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,066
Well, technically,

105
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:30,870
The Earth Queen has a right
to conscript her citizens.

106
00:07:30,872 --> 00:07:32,488
What?
It's true.

107
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,074
Guys, what if Kai
was spotted airbending?

108
00:07:35,076 --> 00:07:36,743
He might have been taken too.

109
00:07:36,745 --> 00:07:37,961
Probably not.

110
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:39,796
He's surprisingly difficult
to catch.

111
00:07:39,798 --> 00:07:42,165
Like a... like a little
greased hog-monkey.

112
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:44,500
But what if he was?

113
00:07:44,502 --> 00:07:47,136
Don't worry, Jinora.
We'll find him.

114
00:07:47,138 --> 00:07:49,222
We just need to figure out
where to look.

115
00:07:49,224 --> 00:07:52,558
I bet they're under Lake Laogai.

116
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,929
What? I've been reading
some of Jinora's books.

117
00:07:55,931 --> 00:07:58,348
The old Dai Li agents
used to have a secret fortress

118
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,766
beneath the lake.

119
00:07:59,768 --> 00:08:01,017
Mako's right.

120
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:02,936
It's the perfect spot
to hide airbenders.

121
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:05,655
And I know how to check it out
without being caught.

122
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:07,907
I can project my spirit into it.

123
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:10,109
You mean
that out-of-body thing you did

124
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:11,527
to help giant spirity-Korra?

125
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:13,029
You can still do that?

126
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:16,699
It's not as powerful as it was
during harmonic convergence,

127
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:20,003
but if I can get close enough,
I think I can do it.

128
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:21,587
Let's go get Kai out.

129
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:23,673
Let's get
all the airbenders out.

130
00:08:28,936 --> 00:08:31,220
You are the property
of the earth kingdom.

131
00:08:31,222 --> 00:08:34,307
You will become the earth
queen's elite fighting force

132
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,858
and protect her at all cost.

133
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,445
It is your duty
to serve The Earth Queen.

134
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:47,453
Aah!

135
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:49,872
Go easy on me.

136
00:08:49,874 --> 00:08:52,792
I'm not that good.

137
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,547
Never show mercy!

138
00:08:58,549 --> 00:08:59,916
Now attack your opponent,

139
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:03,085
and this time, like you mean it.

140
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,423
Sorry.

141
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:09,475
A soldier never apologizes
to his enemy.

142
00:09:09,477 --> 00:09:10,760
I'm not a soldier.

143
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:13,980
You will be
when I'm through with you.

144
00:09:22,823 --> 00:09:25,441
If anything goes wrong,
come back immediately.

145
00:09:25,443 --> 00:09:28,577
I will.

146
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,198
What happened?
What did you see?

147
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,819
The airbenders aren't there.
It's completely deserted.

148
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:11,871
They're not down there?

149
00:10:11,873 --> 00:10:13,990
Jinora, you've read
all about Ba Sing Se.

150
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:15,491
Can you think
of any other places

151
00:10:15,493 --> 00:10:16,709
the airbenders might be?

152
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:18,627
I guess they could be
in the catacombs

153
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:20,162
beneath the upper ring

154
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:22,498
or the ancient sewers
beneath the lower ring

155
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,168
or the maze of tunnels that
connects the rings together,

156
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,803
or they could be...

157
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:29,171
There are just too many places.

158
00:10:29,173 --> 00:10:30,840
There has to be
another way to locate them.

159
00:10:30,842 --> 00:10:32,141
Maybe there is.

160
00:10:32,143 --> 00:10:34,093
How did you find me
during harmonic convergence?

161
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:35,144
I don't know.

162
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:38,180
I just kind of focused
on your energy.

163
00:10:38,182 --> 00:10:40,850
I think our spiritual connection
led me to you.

164
00:10:40,852 --> 00:10:43,185
Maybe you can find Kai
the same way.

165
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:45,271
I know you two
have a connection.

166
00:10:45,273 --> 00:10:47,440
What do you mean a connection?

167
00:10:47,442 --> 00:10:51,944
I don't know.
Let me try.

168
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,461
Ugh!

169
00:11:10,798 --> 00:11:12,848
Ugh!

170
00:11:19,223 --> 00:11:21,390
Thanks.
You again!

171
00:11:21,392 --> 00:11:23,225
If you have time
to help your friend,

172
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:26,312
maybe you're not getting
enough rocks for yourself.

173
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:43,162
I guess you're not
as good as you thought.

174
00:11:47,084 --> 00:11:49,718
Throw him in the hole!

175
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:10,189
Jinora?
It worked!

176
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:12,324
How are you here right now?

177
00:12:12,326 --> 00:12:14,243
Shh, quiet.

178
00:12:14,245 --> 00:12:16,078
It's a high-level
airbender move...

179
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,080
With a little spiritual stuff
thrown in.

180
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,034
For a second there,
I thought you were a ghost.

181
00:12:22,036 --> 00:12:23,452
It's good to see you.

182
00:12:23,454 --> 00:12:26,038
We've been looking for you
and the other airbenders.

183
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,957
We're going to get you all
out of here.

184
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,708
Where are we anyway?

185
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,460
Underground somewhere.

186
00:12:31,462 --> 00:12:33,429
Other than that,
I don't have a clue.

187
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:35,881
I'll figure it out.
Don't worry.

188
00:12:35,883 --> 00:12:38,517
Jinora...
Thanks.

189
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:53,866
The Earth Queen's temple.

190
00:12:55,152 --> 00:12:57,653
I can't believe
miss queeny smugface

191
00:12:57,655 --> 00:12:59,655
had them right under our noses
the whole time!

192
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:02,124
We have to get
into that compound tonight

193
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:03,659
and get those airbenders out.

194
00:13:03,661 --> 00:13:05,711
All right, we go in
under the cover of darkness.

195
00:13:05,713 --> 00:13:08,831
Two small insertion teams
and a third on the outside.

196
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:12,051
Then all we'll need
is 12 tons of blasting jelly,

197
00:13:12,053 --> 00:13:14,136
a medium-sized bulldozer
and...

198
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:16,505
Does anyone have a badger-mole
that knows morse code?

199
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,976
Oh, great.
Not the queen again.

200
00:13:20,978 --> 00:13:23,512
Everyone act normal.
And, Bolin...

201
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:25,397
I'm on it!

202
00:13:26,734 --> 00:13:27,983
What?

203
00:13:27,985 --> 00:13:31,487
Hey, I'm not sweaty this time.

204
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:36,408
Ah!

205
00:13:39,863 --> 00:13:43,032
Lin?
What are you doing here?

206
00:13:43,034 --> 00:13:45,367
We need to get Korra
out of here immediately.

207
00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:46,869
Her life's in danger.
What?

208
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:48,954
What's going on?

209
00:13:48,956 --> 00:13:51,090
I just got word from Lord Zuko
and Tonraq.

210
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:53,259
Why is Lord Zuko with my dad?

211
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:55,127
Zaheer and the others
have escaped.

212
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:57,213
How is that possible?

213
00:13:57,215 --> 00:13:59,515
Because Zaheer
is an airbender now.

214
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:00,633
No.

215
00:14:00,635 --> 00:14:02,851
All right, hold on.

216
00:14:02,853 --> 00:14:05,771
Will you quit ignoring me
and tell me what's going on?

217
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:08,974
Who's Zaheer?
Why is my life in danger?

218
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,862
Shortly after we found out
you were the Avatar,

219
00:14:13,864 --> 00:14:16,699
Zaheer and three others
attempted to kidnap you.

220
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:19,618
Luckily, your father,
Lord Zuko, Chief Sokka, and I

221
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,070
were there to stop them.

222
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:23,822
We apprehended the criminals
and locked them away in prisons

223
00:14:23,824 --> 00:14:25,658
designed to impair
their abilities.

224
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,410
So that's why you and my dad
sheltered me away.

225
00:14:28,412 --> 00:14:30,746
It was for your own safety.

226
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:32,798
Why were they trying
to kidnap Korra?

227
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,134
We spent 13 years
interrogating them,

228
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:36,585
but they never broke.

229
00:14:36,587 --> 00:14:38,971
To this day, no one knows
what their motive was.

230
00:14:38,973 --> 00:14:40,756
Now we need to get you back
to Republic City,

231
00:14:40,758 --> 00:14:42,174
where I can protect you.

232
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:44,510
No, I'm not running.

233
00:14:44,512 --> 00:14:46,478
Korra, you don't understand.

234
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,181
These criminals are like nothing
you've ever faced before.

235
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:51,984
Look, I'm not
a little kid anymore.

236
00:14:51,986 --> 00:14:53,986
You don't need to protect me.

237
00:14:53,988 --> 00:14:55,988
I came here for one thing...
to find airbenders...

238
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,273
and I'm not leaving
without them.

239
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:59,325
Fine, let's get 'em
and get out of here.

240
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,609
Where are they?

241
00:15:00,611 --> 00:15:02,745
In a military compound,

242
00:15:02,747 --> 00:15:04,580
and we're busting them out.

243
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,042
- Hi.
- Hey! What are you doing here?

244
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:16,877
Aw, it's just
that little airbender girl

245
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,212
who came with the Avatar.

246
00:15:18,214 --> 00:15:20,498
You shouldn't be walking
around here all alone.

247
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,551
I'm not alone.

248
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,774
Bumi and Korra,

249
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:48,743
you two will come with me
to find the airbenders.

250
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:51,162
You three find Kai.

251
00:15:51,164 --> 00:15:52,780
We'll meet
on the surface shortly.

252
00:15:52,782 --> 00:15:54,949
Radio us if anything goes wrong.

253
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:07,345
What's going on?
Who are you?

254
00:16:07,347 --> 00:16:08,763
I'm the Avatar,

255
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:10,047
and I'm getting you all
out of here.

256
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:11,966
- We're leaving?
- Where are we going?

257
00:16:11,968 --> 00:16:15,269
Everyone, please,
you must stay calm and quiet

258
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:16,271
if we want this to work.

259
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:18,806
What to work?

260
00:16:18,808 --> 00:16:19,808
We're sneaking out?

261
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:21,976
Yes, and we must leave now.

262
00:16:21,978 --> 00:16:23,728
We're going to get you
away from The Earth Queen

263
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,447
and out of the city.

264
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:29,984
There's an airbender
that's not here.

265
00:16:29,986 --> 00:16:32,870
His name is Kai.
We need to get him.

266
00:16:32,872 --> 00:16:34,455
We're already taking care of it.

267
00:16:34,457 --> 00:16:37,408
Topside, this is papa bear.
The breezies are in the hold.

268
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,410
Cue the balloons.

269
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:39,493
What?

270
00:16:39,495 --> 00:16:41,162
- Are you in trouble?
- No!

271
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:43,080
We got the airbenders,
and we're headed out.

272
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:44,965
Bring the airships.

273
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:47,418
No one likes code names anymore.

274
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,805
Copy that.
Asami and I are on our way.

275
00:16:59,514 --> 00:17:01,348
Come on, we're getting you out.

276
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,683
Kai!

277
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,821
Mwah!

278
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:08,823
Whoa!

279
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:11,242
Tenzin's not going
to be happy about this.

280
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:12,576
Then don't tell him.

281
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:14,945
How can I not?
This is too juicy!

282
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:16,530
Thanks for coming to get me.

283
00:17:16,532 --> 00:17:18,949
I'm really sorry
about stealing your wallets

284
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:20,201
and running away

285
00:17:20,203 --> 00:17:23,204
and getting you stuck
on that train.

286
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:26,424
Oh, we can't stay mad at you!

287
00:17:26,426 --> 00:17:27,758
Yes, we can.

288
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,460
I had a lot of money
in that wallet!

289
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:30,878
Guys, come on.

290
00:17:34,015 --> 00:17:37,718
Deserting her majesty's army
is high treason,

291
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,271
punishable by death.

292
00:17:47,395 --> 00:17:50,898
Come on, it's clear.

293
00:17:58,707 --> 00:18:00,908
So you've discovered
my elite army.

294
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,378
I see their loyalty
still needs some work.

295
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,914
These airbenders
shouldn't be used as weapons.

296
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,582
They have a right to choose
their own paths.

297
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:12,419
These airbenders
are earth kingdom citizens,

298
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:14,255
and I am their queen.

299
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:16,724
Taking them will constitute
an act of war.

300
00:18:16,726 --> 00:18:21,428
If you disobey me,
I will bear down on you

301
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,731
with the entire force
of my kingdom!

302
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:26,100
They're leaving with me.

303
00:18:26,102 --> 00:18:28,686
No, they're not!

304
00:18:48,957 --> 00:18:50,124
Come on!

305
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:29,747
I guess I am as good
as I thought.

306
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:35,336
Everyone's in. Let's go!

307
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:47,097
Oogi!

308
00:19:54,022 --> 00:19:55,856
Take down those airships!

309
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:01,078
Where are the others?

310
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,915
We need help!

311
00:20:17,345 --> 00:20:19,713
Everybody, hang on!

312
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:28,138
Whoa, that was awesome!

313
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,724
Bring me those airships now!

314
00:20:30,726 --> 00:20:32,726
Ahh, ah-choo!

315
00:20:32,728 --> 00:20:35,362
Oh, get it off me!
Ah-choo!

316
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:39,566
Get this fur off...
ahhh-choo!

317
00:20:46,074 --> 00:20:49,243
I know that none of you
chose to become airbenders,

318
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:52,129
but now you do have a choice.

319
00:20:52,131 --> 00:20:54,715
We can relocate you
somewhere safe,

320
00:20:54,717 --> 00:20:57,751
or you can come with me
to the northern air temple

321
00:20:57,753 --> 00:21:01,338
to live in peace
and train as air nomads.

322
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,674
You are no longer
anyone's property.

323
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:07,928
What path you decide
is up to you.

324
00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:11,682
I want to go with you.

325
00:21:11,684 --> 00:21:13,851
- Me too.
- Count me in.

326
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:15,019
- I wanna go too.
- I'll go too.

327
00:21:15,021 --> 00:21:16,186
- Me too.
- Sounds like fun.

328
00:21:16,188 --> 00:21:18,188
- I wanna go too.
- Ooh, I wanna go.

329
00:21:21,443 --> 00:21:23,444
Good luck
at the northern air temple.

330
00:21:23,446 --> 00:21:25,779
I'll send more airbenders
your way when I find them.

331
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:28,615
Be careful out there,
and stay safe.

332
00:21:28,617 --> 00:21:30,367
I'll try.

333
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:33,203
It seems like wherever I go,
I make a new enemy.

334
00:21:33,205 --> 00:21:35,789
But you made
some new friends too.

335
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:39,126
You did well, Korra.

336
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:41,128
This is only the beginning.

337
