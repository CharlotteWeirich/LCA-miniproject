Mako.</i>

<i>The feeling seemed mutual

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

18
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,396
It's been great having you at so many
back-to-back practices, Korra.

19
00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:09,777
Feels good to be back,

20
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:12,616
although Tarrlok isn't too happy
about my leave of absence.

21
00:01:12,634 --> 00:01:15,964
Hey, you joined the Fire Ferrets
<i>before</i> you joined his taskforce.

22
00:01:15,982 --> 00:01:17,679
Okay, come on,
team huddle time!

23
00:01:27,013 --> 00:01:29,035
It's our first match of the tournament
tonight,

24
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:31,936
I know the three of us haven't been
a team for very long, but even so,

25
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,432
the Fire Ferrets have never been
this good.

26
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:36,151
- Are we ready?
- We're ready!

27
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:39,417
Not quite...
You'll need these!

28
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:41,876
- Hey, Asami.
- Good morning, Sweetie!

29
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:46,258
- These new uniforms look great!
- You look great, champ!

30
00:01:48,448 --> 00:01:49,992
Well, teammates...

31
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:52,104
I'll see you before the match tonight,

32
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,743
Asami and I have a lunch date.

33
00:01:53,923 --> 00:01:56,838
Okay, we'll check you guys later,
you know, we see you when we see ya.

34
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,679
So... Korra.

35
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:04,838
There they go, here we are,

36
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:06,703
alone in the gym.

37
00:02:06,952 --> 00:02:08,740
Just you and me...

38
00:02:08,884 --> 00:02:11,465
Two alone people.

39
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,217
Together...

40
00:02:13,242 --> 00:02:15,242
- Alone.
- Uh...

41
00:02:15,788 --> 00:02:19,294
I gotta head back to the Air Temple
to train with Tenzin. See ya!

44
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,618
So...

45
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:35,653
What do you think of Korra,
in a...

46
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:37,584
Girlfriend sort of way?

47
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,923
She's great!

48
00:02:39,135 --> 00:02:41,607
But I think it makes more sense for me
to go for Asami!

49
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,913
I was talking
about a girlfriend for me!

50
00:02:43,923 --> 00:02:45,658
Leave some ladies
for the rest of us!

51
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:47,558
I know, that's what I thought
you meant.

52
00:02:48,248 --> 00:02:50,192
Well, I don't know, Bo.

53
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:52,484
It doesn't seem like a good idea
for you to date Korra.

54
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,973
You just said she was great,
two seconds ago.

55
00:02:54,996 --> 00:02:58,752
Yeah, Korra is a great athlete,
and Avatar and stuff, but...

56
00:02:59,081 --> 00:03:00,850
I don't know if she is really
"girlfriend material".

57
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:03,469
- She's more like a pal.
- Bro, you're nuts!

58
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:06,067
Korra and I
are perfect for each other!

59
00:03:06,107 --> 00:03:09,176
She's strong, I'm strong;
she's fun, I'm fun;

60
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,432
she's beautiful, I'm gorgeous!

61
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:14,941
Okay, I don't care what you think;
I'm gonna ask Korra out.

62
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:17,825
Look, it just isn't smart
to date a teammate.

63
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:19,397
Especially during the tournament.

64
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:22,346
Keep your head out of the clouds
and your priorities straight.

65
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:25,168
- Okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I know, duh!

66
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,117
You know what I'm talking about,
Pabu.

67
00:03:27,463 --> 00:03:29,092
Talkin' 'bout <i>real love</i>...

68
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,091
So how's it going
with the tall, dreamy Firebender boy?

69
00:03:42,111 --> 00:03:44,884
You've been spending
a lot of time together lately!

70
00:03:44,904 --> 00:03:48,735
Oooh, yeah, tell us all
about the magical romance.

71
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,351
What? Ha!
Listen to you two,

72
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:54,435
I-I'm not interested in Mako,
or any romantic stuff.

73
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:58,542
Besides, he's all into that pretty,
beautiful, elegant, rich girl...

74
00:03:59,387 --> 00:04:02,791
But let's just pretend for a second
<i>I am</i> interested in him...

75
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,576
- What would I do?
- Ooh!

76
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,706
I just read a historical saga,

77
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,901
where the heroine fell in love
with the enemy general's son,

78
00:04:09,906 --> 00:04:11,784
who's supposed
to marry the princess.

79
00:04:11,815 --> 00:04:14,008
- You should do what she did.
- Tell me!

80
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:17,784
She rode a dragon into battle
and burned down the entire country,

81
00:04:17,812 --> 00:04:21,488
then she jumped into a volcano...
It was so romantic...!

82
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,798
- Uh...
- No, no, no!

83
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,380
The best way to win a boys heart is to
brew a love potion of rainbows and sunsets

84
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:30,974
that makes true lovers sprout wings and
fly into a magical castle in the sky,

85
00:04:30,986 --> 00:04:32,920
where they get married
and eat clouds with spoons,

86
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:35,075
and use stars as ice cubes
in their moonlight punch.

87
00:04:35,096 --> 00:04:36,752
For ever and ever and ever!

88
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,980
The volcano is starting
to make more sense to me now.

89
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:41,733
[laughs, somewhere in the back]

90
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:44,185
Oh, hey, Pema.
Hm...

91
00:04:44,358 --> 00:04:47,345
- Uh, how long were you standing there?
- Hm...

92
00:04:47,346 --> 00:04:48,831
Long enough.

93
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:51,797
But trust me,
I know what you're going through.

94
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:54,604
Years ago I was
in the exact same situation...

95
00:04:54,617 --> 00:04:55,892
With Tenzin.

96
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:58,438
Daddy was in love with someone else,
before you?

97
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:00,547
- That's right.
- So what did you do?

98
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:03,102
Well, for the longest time,
I did nothing.

99
00:05:03,126 --> 00:05:05,659
I was so shy
and scared of rejection...

100
00:05:05,768 --> 00:05:09,125
But watching my soul mate
spend his life with the wrong woman...

101
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,772
Became too painful.

102
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,677
So I hung my chin out there
and I confessed my love to Tenzin.

103
00:05:14,707 --> 00:05:16,381
And the rest is history.

104
00:05:16,408 --> 00:05:18,296
Wooow...!

105
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:26,873
<i>Folks, after a year of waiting,</i>

106
00:05:26,884 --> 00:05:30,860
<i>the pro-bending championship tournament
is finally here.</i>

107
00:05:30,892 --> 00:05:32,793
<i>Tonight is the first set of matches</i>

108
00:05:32,805 --> 00:05:35,701
<i>in our single elimination
sixteen team bracket.</i>

109
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:36,971
And I gotta tell ya,

110
00:05:36,976 --> 00:05:41,610
these are the most tenacious and talented
bending trios this arena has ever seen.

111
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:45,340
<i>Introducing our first team,</i>

112
00:05:45,365 --> 00:05:49,469
<i>the Future Industries Fire Ferrets!</i>

113
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:52,118
[Cheers and booing by the crowd.]

114
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:54,341
<i>And their opponents,</i>

115
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:58,128
<i>the Red Sands Rabbiroos.</i>

116
00:05:58,153 --> 00:06:00,987
[Cheers by the crowd.]

117
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:05,977
<i>What an explosive opening volley!</i>

118
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:09,224
<i>Both teams quickly recover
and unleash a barrage of bending.</i>

119
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:11,563
<i>I am astonished
with the level of improvement</i>

120
00:06:11,564 --> 00:06:13,336
<i>displayed here
by the Fire Ferrets.</i>

121
00:06:13,361 --> 00:06:16,370
<i>No wonder the Avatar has been absent
from the papers lately.</i>

122
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:20,112
<i>She's obviously had her nose
to the grindstone in the gym.</i>

123
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:21,898
<i>The Ferrets advance
into Rabbiroo territory,</i>

124
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,736
<i>and they're holding nothing back.</i>

125
00:06:23,761 --> 00:06:25,251
<i>Nice prowl there by Mako,</i>

126
00:06:25,276 --> 00:06:27,297
<i>Bolin strikes, Uma dodges...</i>

127
00:06:27,323 --> 00:06:29,639
<i>and all three Rabbiroos are down!</i>

128
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:32,338
<i>The Fire Ferrets
easily take round one.</i>

129
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:34,786
Round two!

130
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:36,506
<i>The Rabbiroos are looking
for payback,</i>

131
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:38,450
<i>and they go straight after Bolin.</i>

132
00:06:38,475 --> 00:06:40,150
<i>Korra comes to his defense,</i>

133
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:42,868
<i>and she Water whacked Uli
back into Zone Two!</i>

134
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:46,620
<i>The Ferrets are on fire tonight,
and they win round two.</i>

135
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,531
Round three!

136
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:53,136
<i>With the Rabbiroos down two rounds,
they'll need a knockout to win,</i>

137
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:55,000
<i>and with the way
the Fire Ferrets are playing,</i>

138
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:57,025
<i>I don't see that happening.</i>

139
00:06:59,946 --> 00:07:03,733
<i>These Ferrets are working together
like a well-oiled bending machine.</i>

140
00:07:06,113 --> 00:07:07,757
<i>Bolin passes Ali
back into Zone Two,</i>

141
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:10,637
<i>and the Ferrets get the green light
to advance. [Cheers by the crowd.]</i>

142
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:13,725
<i>The Rabbiroos are just fighting
to stay at their feet at this point.</i>

143
00:07:14,508 --> 00:07:17,047
<i>Down goes Ali, and Uma,
and Uli!</i>

144
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:20,849
<i>All three rounds go to
the Future Industries Fire Ferrets,</i>

145
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:23,702
<i>to win the opening match
of the tournament!</i>

146
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:26,593
- U-hu! - Yes!
- That's what I'm talking about!

147
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:31,553
<i>- Thank you, thank you very much!</i>
- Wow, we were really connecting,

148
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:33,791
- ...out there, in that ring!
- Yeah!

149
00:07:33,816 --> 00:07:36,195
You know, I feel like the two of us
have been connecting really well

150
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,220
- ...out of the ring, too!
- Uh...

151
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:41,442
- Sure! - So, I was thinking
we should spend some time together.

152
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:43,467
We've been spending
lots of time together!

153
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,109
I mean, outside of the team.

154
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:49,121
And not while searching for kidnapped
family members or fighting chi-blockers!

155
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:50,614
I don't now...

156
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:52,446
- Asami and I...
- Look, I really like you,

157
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:54,501
and I think we were meant
for each other!

158
00:07:57,688 --> 00:07:59,994
Korra, I'm really sorry, but...

159
00:08:00,486 --> 00:08:03,004
I just don't feel the same way
about you.

160
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,300
Forget I've ever said anything.

161
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:09,745
Congratulations guys!

162
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:12,367
You were so amazing
out there...

163
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:24,145
So... Korra...
I was thinking...

164
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,919
You and me, we could get
some dinner together...

165
00:08:26,944 --> 00:08:30,133
- Sort of a date situation...
- Oh...

166
00:08:30,403 --> 00:08:33,276
That's really sweet,
but I don't think so.

167
00:08:33,783 --> 00:08:36,931
- I don't feel very date worthy.
- Are you kidding me?

168
00:08:36,947 --> 00:08:40,114
You're the smartest, funniest,
toughest, buffest, <i>talentedest</i>...

169
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:42,937
- ...incrediblest girl in the world!
- Hm-hm-hm-hm!

170
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:45,036
Ah, you really feel that way
about me?

171
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:47,720
I felt that way
since the moment I saw you.

172
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,840
Trust me, I know we're gonna have
so much fun together.

173
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:53,667
You know what?
I could use some fun.

174
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:55,612
- Okay, sure.
- Yes!

175
00:08:55,637 --> 00:08:59,048
Who's the luckiest guy in the world,
right here, Bolin!

176
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:16,038
- So how'd you like it?
- Hmm, it's delicious!

177
00:09:16,063 --> 00:09:17,654
And totally authentic.

178
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:20,432
I didn't realize how much I missed
Water Tribe grub.

179
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:22,484
That's great,
cause this is my favorite joint.

180
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:25,536
See? You love Water Tribe food,
I love Water Tribe food,

181
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:28,301
just another reason
we are so great together.

182
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:29,763
They are good noodles!

183
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,928
Hey who's that creepy guy over there
who keeps glaring at us?

184
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,996
That's Tahno, and the Wolfbats.

185
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,719
Reigning champs,
three years running.

186
00:09:39,744 --> 00:09:41,304
Don't make the eye contact!

187
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:51,054
Uh-oh, here he comes...

188
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,228
Now don't mess with this guy,
he's a nasty dude.

189
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,874
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the Fire Ferrets...

190
00:10:01,082 --> 00:10:04,037
Pro-bending's saddest excuse
for a team.

191
00:10:04,075 --> 00:10:08,029
Tell me, how did a couple of amateurs like
you luck your way into the tournament?

192
00:10:08,054 --> 00:10:10,840
Especially you, Avatar.

193
00:10:11,683 --> 00:10:15,424
You know, if you'd like to learn
how a real pro bends,

194
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:17,949
I could give you
some private lessons.

195
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,344
You wanna go toe-to-toe with me,
<i>pretty boy</i>?

196
00:10:21,656 --> 00:10:24,559
Go for it.
I'll give you the first shot.

197
00:10:24,783 --> 00:10:26,445
Korra, don't.

198
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,632
He's just trying to bait you. If you
hit him, we're out of the tournament.

199
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:52,241
Wohoho, I've never seen
someone harass Tahno like that.

200
00:10:52,272 --> 00:10:54,792
You are one of a kind, Korra.

201
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:01,098
[burps]

202
00:11:01,935 --> 00:11:03,371
[burps]

203
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:06,843
[and the burping contest begins...]

204
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:12,529
- Ha-ha...
- Ha-ha!

205
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:40,647
- What kind of game are you playing?
- Uh... pro-bending?

206
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:43,840
- We've got the quarterfinal match...?
- No, I mean with Bolin.

207
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:46,774
You've got him all in a tizzy and I know
you're only using him to get back at me.

208
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,274
I am not,
we're just having fun together.

209
00:11:49,422 --> 00:11:52,275
- What do you care, anyway?
- I'm looking out for my little brother.

210
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,345
- I don't wanna see his heart get broken.
- Wait a second...

211
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,243
You're not worried about him.
You're jealous!

212
00:11:58,281 --> 00:12:01,904
- You do have feelings for me!
- What? "Jealous"?

213
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:03,672
Tsch!
Don't be ridiculous.

214
00:12:03,847 --> 00:12:05,943
Admit it: you like me.

215
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:08,038
No! I'm with Asami!

216
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,734
Yeah, but when you're with her,
you are thinking about me, aren't you...

217
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:13,087
- Get over yourself!
- I'm just being honest!

218
00:12:13,112 --> 00:12:15,112
- You're crazy!
- You're a liar!

219
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:19,368
Hey, Ma-ko-oh...!

220
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:21,640
Eight teams have been eliminated

221
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,911
and eight advance
into the quarter finals,

222
00:12:23,934 --> 00:12:25,919
<i>which get on their way tonight.</i>

223
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,529
<i>The rookies are about to take on the
former and longest reigning champs,</i>

224
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:31,045
<i>the Boarcupines.</i>

225
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,890
Youth bashes against experience,

226
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:34,780
in a battle for the ages,

227
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:37,407
or rather <i>of the ages</i>.

228
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:47,157
<i>Korra dodges and, ooh,
slams right into her teammate!</i>

229
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:51,375
Down goes Mako, and Bolin,
and Korra!

230
00:12:51,468 --> 00:12:55,352
<i>Round one goes to the Boarcupines!</i>

231
00:12:55,653 --> 00:12:57,527
You were supposed to defend,
while I attacked!

232
00:12:57,552 --> 00:12:59,788
I had an opening, so I took it!

233
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,121
What is up with you two?

234
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,528
Alright, whatever,
just pull together guys.

235
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:08,208
<i>The Ferrets looking to mount
some offence here, in round two.</i>

236
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:18,051
<i>Bolin lets fly a flurry of attacks</i>

237
00:13:18,076 --> 00:13:21,205
<i>He's a one man bending battalion.</i>

238
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:24,921
<i>The Ferrets have a tough time
finding their rhythm tonight,</i>

239
00:13:24,946 --> 00:13:28,497
<i>but thanks to Bolin,
they narrowly nudge round two.</i>

240
00:13:32,987 --> 00:13:34,531
<i>Not sure what's eating them,</i>

241
00:13:34,556 --> 00:13:37,897
<i>but this is not the same team
who took out the Rabbiroos.</i>

242
00:13:38,743 --> 00:13:41,007
Round three is a tie!

243
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:44,437
<i>We go to a tie-breaker,
to decide the match.</i>

244
00:13:47,438 --> 00:13:50,122
The Fire Ferrets win the coin toss!

245
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,040
- Which element do you choose?
- I got this.

246
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:56,854
I know you usually handle this,
but frankly, your head's not in the game.

247
00:13:56,886 --> 00:13:58,626
I'm gonna take this one.

248
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:01,222
We choose Earth.

249
00:14:02,645 --> 00:14:04,669
<i>Looks like the Earthbenders will collide,</i>

250
00:14:04,688 --> 00:14:06,731
<i>in the tie-breaker faceoff.</i>

251
00:14:16,331 --> 00:14:18,642
<i>Bolin goes in for the grapple...</i>

252
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,347
<i>Chang reversed it.</i>

253
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:24,253
<i>Bolin strikes from midair,
knocking Chang to the edge of the circle.</i>

254
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:28,022
<i>Another strike from Bolin,
and Chang is in the drain!</i>

255
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:31,002
<i>The Future Industries Fire Ferrets</i>

256
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:33,836
<i>win their quarter final match!</i>

257
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:36,109
<i>That was a close one, folks!</i>

258
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,400
<i>Youth trumps experience tonight.</i>

259
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,298
We need to talk.

260
00:14:45,332 --> 00:14:48,107
Look, sometimes you can be
so infuriating. I-

261
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:49,500
Save your breath.

262
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,600
You've already made it clear
how you feel about me.

263
00:14:51,618 --> 00:14:53,437
No I haven't.

264
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:55,206
What I'm trying to say is...

265
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,080
As much as you drive me crazy...

266
00:14:57,524 --> 00:14:59,311
I also think
you're pretty amazing.

267
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:03,237
- So... you do like me?
- Yes! But...

268
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,381
I like Asami, too.
I don't know, things are complicated.

269
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:09,551
But feeling really confused an-

270
00:15:30,056 --> 00:15:31,703
Bolin, this isn't what you think.

271
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:37,923
- Great! Look at what you did!
- You're blaming me?

272
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:40,663
- You're the one who kissed me!
- You kissed me back!

273
00:15:45,084 --> 00:15:47,161
"Well-played", Korra...

274
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,880
'Morning, Narook.
My brother here?

275
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,960
Thanks.

276
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,831
Come on... wake up.

277
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:00,550
Takin' you home, bro.

278
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:03,983
Don't call me that...

279
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:05,840
You're not my brother!

280
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:08,110
You're a brother-betrayer!

281
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:12,296
The only one I can trust anymore...

282
00:16:12,324 --> 00:16:14,167
Is Pabu...

283
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:16,752
Pabu loves me...

284
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:20,955
You're a mess, and we've got
the biggest match of our lives tonight.

285
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:22,618
- Let's go.
- No!

286
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:24,942
I'm not going anywhere with you!

287
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:26,542
You, traitor!

288
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:28,247
Guess I'll have to do this
the hard way.

289
00:16:28,276 --> 00:16:31,876
O-o-oh, why...?

290
00:16:32,746 --> 00:16:35,302
I told you dating a teammate
was a bad idea.

291
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,519
You're a bad idea!

292
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:39,808
Put me down...!

293
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:43,490
Put... me... down...

294
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:06,645
<i>You can't find two teams
more evenly matched</i>

295
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,489
<i>in age, size and strength</i>

296
00:17:08,514 --> 00:17:11,101
<i>than the Fire Ferrets
and the Buzzard Wasps.</i>

297
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:12,932
<i>Believe me, I've looked!</i>

298
00:17:12,957 --> 00:17:16,166
<i>This should be a pulse-pounding
semi-final, folks!</i>

299
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:23,510
<i>The Buzzard Wasps open with a
flawlessly executed combo!</i>

300
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:27,039
<i>All three Ferrets take an early visit
to Zone Two!</i>

301
00:17:27,064 --> 00:17:29,986
<i>And Mako's knocked
all the way back to the Zone Three!</i>

302
00:17:30,011 --> 00:17:33,102
<i>The Fire Ferrets have been struggling
to stay alive since the opening bell.</i>

303
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:36,121
<i>All three players
are totally out of sync tonight!</i>

304
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:38,684
<i>Uh! That has got to sting!</i>

305
00:17:43,781 --> 00:17:45,853
<i>And Bolin loses his noodles.</i>

306
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,546
Literally! Which reminds me.

This match is brought to you
by our sponsor:

308
00:17:49,965 --> 00:17:51,891
"Flameo Instant Noodles".

309
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,200
Noodliest noodles
in the United Republic!

310
00:17:59,601 --> 00:18:03,038
<i>The Buzzard Wasps fly deeper
into Ferret territory.</i>

311
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,661
<i>And Mako plunges into the pool!</i>

312
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:11,686
<i>Can the Fire Ferrets hold on?</i>

313
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:15,031
<i>The Wasps have the Ferrets
backed up to the edge now,</i>

314
00:18:16,243 --> 00:18:19,141
<i>and the Ferrets are bailed out
by the bell!</i>

315
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,948
<i>They had better pull themselves together,
folks, for round two,</i>

316
00:18:21,973 --> 00:18:24,726
<i>otherwise they can kiss the finals
good-bye!</i>

317
00:18:33,537 --> 00:18:35,401
Hey! Watch it!

318
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:37,881
<i>The Wasps take advantage
of Mako's unforced error</i>

319
00:18:37,906 --> 00:18:39,906
<i>and Bolin's in the pool!</i>

320
00:18:42,896 --> 00:18:45,164
Ooh, and a blatant hold
by the Avatar!

321
00:18:46,345 --> 00:18:49,413
Unnecessary roughness!
<i>Move back one zone!</i>

322
00:18:49,438 --> 00:18:51,708
I'll "unnecessarily" rough you up!

323
00:18:52,795 --> 00:18:55,983
<i>And the Avatar is slapped
with the yellow fan!</i>

324
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,624
<i>The Ferrets are their own worst enemy
right now.</i>

325
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:00,571
<i>It's just sad to watch.</i>

326
00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:03,313
<i>With the Buzzard Wasps leading
two rounds to zilch,</i>

327
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:05,804
<i>the Ferrets' only hope of winning
is with a knockout.</i>

328
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:07,309
Well, I guess
there's always "next year".

329
00:19:07,328 --> 00:19:10,265
Come on, we still have a chance!
Even if it is a slim one.

330
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,921
The way we're playing, we don't even
deserve to be in the finals.

331
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:16,692
Look, if we don't pull together
and work as a team,

332
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:19,872
- ...we'll never forgive ourselves.
- Let's just get this over with.

333
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:21,433
The sooner, the better.

334
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,263
<i>Bolin's knocked into Zone Two,
followed quickly by his brother.</i>

335
00:19:40,442 --> 00:19:42,611
<i>And Bolin takes a zinger,
to the shoulder.</i>

336
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,306
<i>Looks like it's a clean hit.</i>

337
00:19:44,331 --> 00:19:45,714
Owww!

338
00:19:46,176 --> 00:19:47,590
Bolin!

339
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:50,395
<i>Mako's in the drinker
and out of the match.</i>

340
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,972
<i>And Bolin keeps playing
with one good arm!</i>

341
00:19:52,997 --> 00:19:55,488
<i>I gotta hand it to him,
this kid's got grit.</i>

342
00:19:55,513 --> 00:19:57,262
<i>But how long can he keep it up?</i>

343
00:19:57,287 --> 00:19:59,164
<i>Apparently, not very long.</i>

344
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:01,440
<i>The Ferret's dream
of making it to the finals</i>

345
00:20:01,465 --> 00:20:03,465
<i>now rests in the Avatar's hands.</i>

346
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:06,036
<i>But with three on one,
I don't like her odds.</i>

347
00:20:10,855 --> 00:20:12,121
Are you OK?

348
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:14,078
- How's your shoulder?
- Aah...

349
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:15,890
It's messed up pretty bad.

350
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,357
But I think I'll be all right.

351
00:20:21,348 --> 00:20:23,755
Are <i>we</i>... gonna be all right?

352
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:26,351
Of course we are.
We're brothers.

353
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,210
We'll get through this mess.

354
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:31,591
- I'm sorry...
- Me too.

355
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,290
- Girls...
- Seriously.

356
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,229
<i>What an unbelievable effort here,
by Korra.</i>

357
00:20:37,254 --> 00:20:40,264
<i>She's dodging every Element
the Wasps throw at her.</i>

358
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,457
<i>The Avatar
finally gains some grounds,</i>

359
00:20:44,482 --> 00:20:47,677
<i>but with only ten seconds remaining,
it's likely too little, too late.</i>

360
00:20:51,177 --> 00:20:52,630
<i>It's the big kabosh!</i>

361
00:20:52,655 --> 00:20:54,869
<i>What a knockout!</i>

362
00:20:56,776 --> 00:20:58,682
- Yes!
- We did it!

363
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:00,363
Yeees!

364
00:21:00,388 --> 00:21:04,448
<i>It didn't seem possible, folks, but
the Fire Ferrets are headed to the finals!</i>

365
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,111
Ha-haaa!

366
00:21:06,136 --> 00:21:08,637
- Shoulder, shoulder!
- Sorry!

367
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,417
That... was pretty much
the coolest thing I've ever seen.

368
00:21:13,442 --> 00:21:15,330
Thanks for not giving up on us.

369
00:21:15,355 --> 00:21:17,628
We never would have made it
this far without you.

370
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:20,062
I owe you. Big time.

371
00:21:20,087 --> 00:21:21,836
You're welcome.

372
00:21:21,861 --> 00:21:23,318
So...

373
00:21:23,343 --> 00:21:25,747
I know things are confusing
right now...

374
00:21:25,772 --> 00:21:28,702
- But I hope we can still be friends.
- Definitely.

375
00:21:31,504 --> 00:21:32,940
Ooh...

376
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,017
You boys smell something in here?

377
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,553
Wait, I know what that is...

378
00:21:39,572 --> 00:21:41,583
Yeah, that's the scent of losers.

379
00:21:41,654 --> 00:21:43,594
I hope we see you in the finals.

380
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:46,677
- Then we'll see who the losers really are.
- Yeah...

381
00:21:46,744 --> 00:21:49,047
I'm peeing in my pants over here.

382
00:21:49,072 --> 00:21:52,260
<i>And now, the defending champs,</i>

383
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:55,506
<i>the White Falls Wolfbats!</i>

384
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:57,309
Great job!

385
00:21:58,658 --> 00:22:00,079
What a comeback, Korra!

386
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:03,290
- I've never seen <i>a hat trick</i> like that.
- Oh, thanks.

387
00:22:03,368 --> 00:22:05,596
But, if it hadn't been
for you and your father,

388
00:22:05,597 --> 00:22:07,500
we wouldn't have had
the chance to play.

389
00:22:07,531 --> 00:22:08,837
So, thank <i>you</i>.

390
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:11,254
Uh, if everyone's done
with the little "thank you" party...

391
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,221
- I need some medical attention over here!
- Oh, let me help!

392
00:22:15,396 --> 00:22:18,572
Ow! Haven't you hurt me enough,
woman?

393
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:20,714
Relax, I'm a healer.

394
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,977
I learned from Katara,
the best there is.

395
00:22:23,002 --> 00:22:25,993
No, no, no, no...

396
00:22:26,018 --> 00:22:27,948
Oh-o-o...
That's the stuff...

397
00:22:27,974 --> 00:22:31,330
Bolin...
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

398
00:22:31,523 --> 00:22:34,017
I didn't mean to let things
get so out of hand.

399
00:22:34,404 --> 00:22:36,531
Ah... I'll be alright.

400
00:22:36,793 --> 00:22:40,511
- But we had fun together, didn't we?
- I had a great time, honestly!

401
00:22:40,854 --> 00:22:42,939
<i>You</i> are one of a kind, Bolin.

402
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:46,346
Please, go on...
I enjoy praise.

403
00:22:46,371 --> 00:22:47,996
<i>Your winners!</i>

404
00:22:48,021 --> 00:22:50,305
<i>The Wolfbats!</i>

405
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,716
What?
How is it over already?

406
00:22:52,782 --> 00:22:55,327
<i>With a brutal round one knockout,</i>

407
00:22:55,352 --> 00:22:58,372
<i>the defending champs
secure their spot in the finals.</i>

408
00:22:58,397 --> 00:23:02,120
<i>I hope the Ferrets know a good doctor,
because they're gonna need one!</i>

409
00:23:03,907 --> 00:23:08,763
