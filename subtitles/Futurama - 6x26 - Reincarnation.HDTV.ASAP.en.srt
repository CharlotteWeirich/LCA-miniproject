Um, would it be possible
to break off a piece

47
00:02:19,386 --> 00:02:20,920
and put it
in an engagement ring

Whatever you say, mon.

Due to the lens' remarkable
quark lattice structure,

00:09:04,305 --> 00:09:05,572
Apparently so.

164
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,907
Wait, there's a snail

165
00:09:06,974 --> 00:09:08,709
on the tail of the frog
on the bump

166
00:09:08,776 --> 00:09:12,345
on this log that I found in
a hole in the bottom of the sea.

167
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:13,280
Dear Liza.

168
00:09:13,347 --> 00:09:15,048
The snail itself is composed

169
00:09:15,116 --> 00:09:18,085
of cells, molecules, atoms.

170
00:09:18,152 --> 00:09:20,020
Pfft, those things don't rhyme.

171
00:09:20,088 --> 00:09:22,456
Things only rhyme below ten
to the minus five angstroms,

172
00:09:22,523 --> 00:09:23,757
you dope.

173
00:09:23,825 --> 00:09:27,427
Now, ions and pions,
muons and gluons,

174
00:09:27,495 --> 00:09:29,796
neutrinos, gravitinos...

175
00:09:29,864 --> 00:09:34,034
We're closing in on the very
smallest particles of matter.

176
00:09:34,102 --> 00:09:35,769
For the first time,
we're about to observe

177
00:09:35,837 --> 00:09:39,039
the fundamental structure
of the universe.

178
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:43,977
Such detail.

179
00:09:44,045 --> 00:09:47,280
Such finely wrought,
intricate beauty.

180
00:09:47,348 --> 00:09:50,317
It's like staring
into the face of God.

181
00:09:50,384 --> 00:09:52,619
It's a mirror
into Scruffy's soul.

182
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:54,087
This explains everything,

183
00:09:54,155 --> 00:09:57,090
even the big bang
that created the universe.

184
00:09:57,158 --> 00:10:00,060
All that's left is
the mathematics.

185
00:10:00,128 --> 00:10:03,730
Put down h-bar,
carry the infinity, and...

186
00:10:03,798 --> 00:10:05,165
My-reka!

187
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:06,433
There it is,

188
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:08,502
the grand unified theory,

189
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:12,706
reducing all the laws of nate
to a single equation.

190
00:10:12,774 --> 00:10:14,307
Professor, you did it.

191
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,777
You solved the problem
that baffled Einstein

192
00:10:16,844 --> 00:10:18,111
and drove Stephen Hawking

193
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:21,181
to quit physics and become
a cartoon voice actor.

194
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:24,417
I like physics, but
I love cartoons.

195
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:27,988
This is the greatest moment
in scientific history.

196
00:10:28,055 --> 00:10:32,726
At last, there are no more
questions left to answer.

197
00:10:37,031 --> 00:10:38,932
Well done, Professor.

198
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,600
Okay, back to work, everyone.

199
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:48,241
Wait, there are
no more questions

200
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:50,777
left to answer.

201
00:11:17,905 --> 00:11:20,407

Thanks, Morbo.

know to protect your family.

00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:29,916
How do you people do it?

206
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:33,787
How do you go on, knowing
there's nothing more to know?

207
00:11:33,855 --> 00:11:35,121
I watch TV.

208
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:36,923
It's the next best thing
to being alive.

209
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:39,059
Oh, what's the use?

210
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:42,362
I'm just not capable
of the happiness of the dumb.

211
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,232
If only I'd made some mistake!

212
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:48,935
You didn't. I checked the
invariance of your Lagrangian.

213
00:11:49,003 --> 00:11:50,270
Hubba hubba.

214
00:11:50,338 --> 00:11:52,906
Then there's
nothing left to do!

215
00:11:52,974 --> 00:11:56,142
Nothing!

216
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,246
Would it cheer you up if
I punched Fry in the groin?

217
00:11:59,313 --> 00:12:01,248
'Cause I'll do it, regardless.

218
00:12:01,315 --> 00:12:03,149
Body blow! Body blow!

219
00:12:03,217 --> 00:12:05,552
I devoted every waking minute

220
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,622
to answering the fundamental
questions of science.

221
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:11,391
<i>I never married,</i>
<i>rarely went outside...</i>

222
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,627
and now that I've found
all the answers,

223
00:12:13,694 --> 00:12:16,296
I realize
that what I was living for

224
00:12:16,364 --> 00:12:18,265
were the questions.

225
00:12:18,332 --> 00:12:19,566
That stinks, Professor.

226
00:12:19,634 --> 00:12:21,468
Too bad the universe
made it turn out that way

227
00:12:21,535 --> 00:12:22,736
and not some other way.

228
00:12:22,803 --> 00:12:24,204
I wonder why it did that.

229
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:25,639
Probably magnets.

230
00:12:25,706 --> 00:12:28,708
Shut up, Hawking!
Fry, you idiot!

231
00:12:28,776 --> 00:12:30,310
You're a genius!

232
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:34,447
Why are the laws of
physics what they are,

233
00:12:34,515 --> 00:12:36,283
instead of some other laws?

234
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,219
To find out, we'd have
to recreate the conditions

235
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:40,620
before the big bang.

236
00:12:40,688 --> 00:12:42,255
It would take decades of work

237
00:12:42,323 --> 00:12:43,823
by thousands of scientists

238
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:46,893
in a particle accelerator

239

of flaming grant money!

240
00:12:48,562 --> 00:12:51,831
Of course, there'd be no
guarantee of success,

241
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,701
and, in any case,
I'd never live to see it.

242
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:56,770
I'm surprised you lived
through that sentence.

243
00:12:56,837 --> 00:12:58,805
Sorry you wasted
your life, Professor.

244
00:12:58,873 --> 00:13:01,207
I guess you'll never know
everything, after all.

245
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:03,743
Indeed. The pursuit of knowledge

246

00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,139
<i>English.</i>

326
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,941
...like us,
they speak by dancing.

327
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,810
Of course! Having no
mouths or ears,

328
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,545
they could only communicate
through motions.

329
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:00,746
Or perhaps by odors.

330
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:02,181
That is how you communicate.

331
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,184
Then our only hope
to talk to them

332
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,919
is by doing a peace dance.

333
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,754
But it will have to be smoother
and more fluid

334
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:10,889
than any movement mankind
is capable of!

335
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,558
What if we hire
a buttered geisha?

336
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,793
Another one of your
ill-timed jokes, Fry?

337
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,795
You and I are enemies now.

338
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,564
Hear my words.
I believe I,

339
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,666
the most humble member
of Action Delivery Team,

340
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,201
could do such a dance.

341
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,736
Ha, ha, ha, ha. Surely,
your hard shell is too rigid.

342
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:27,473
I call on anyone but you
to do the peace dance.

343
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:30,342
Of course,
I will do the peace dance.

344
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,643
But I will need help.

345
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,946
Super Dance Squad, initiate!

346
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:49,595
We all hope they're
communicating

347
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:50,896
a peaceful message.

348
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,422
Wha-wha? We thought
we were so smart

349
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,824
with our science and dancing.

350
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:21,226
But look at us now,
at Gigatron's mercy!

351
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:24,263
The shame is too great.
It's time to end this.

352
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,001
Zoidberg, stop!
We're too scared right now

353
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,702
to enjoy the ceremony
of your death.

354
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:36,441
No hara-kiri today,
but <i>heiwa no dansu.</i>

355
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,310
The gelatinous dance of peace.

356
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:41,413
You may be gelatinous,
but not even the Mochi Phantom

357
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:43,315
could perform
such intricate motions!

358
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:45,651
Says you, salaryman.

359
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,759
Behold: the dance of peace.

360
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:04,036

361
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:11,168
The dance is so complex,
I can't barely follow it.

362
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,190
**** team member,
but I have given it my own.

363
00:20:21,315 --> 00:20:23,353
I underestimated you, Medical Crab.

364
00:20:23,478 --> 00:20:25,015
But, will the Aliens understand?

365
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:34,974
Zoidberg, you are the greatest hero.

366
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:36,016
You save this all.

367
00:20:36,141 --> 00:20:36,931
For now,

368
00:20:37,056 --> 00:20:41,099
But another ****
next week at the same time.

369
00:20:41,224 --> 00:20:42,158
Until then,

370
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:46,912
Action Delivery Force Star Hero
**** engaged.
