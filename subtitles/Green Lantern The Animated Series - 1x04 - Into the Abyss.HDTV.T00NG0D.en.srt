<b>1x04 - Into the Abyss</b>

2
00:00:07,658 --> 00:00:09,993
<i>Previously on Green Lantern...</i>

3
00:00:10,061 --> 00:00:13,030
You proud of what you did?
Answer me!

4
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:15,165
Easy there, Kilowog.

5
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:19,503
We just got our butts
saved by a Red Lantern.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,238
He's comin with us.

7
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:36,186
Unh!

8
00:00:36,254 --> 00:00:38,388
Ahh. Grub time!

9
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:48,999
You got a problem, poozer?

10
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:52,836
Only that I dislike
clumsy 7-foot pigs.

11
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:56,606
Err!

12
00:00:56,674 --> 00:00:57,774
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

13
00:00:57,842 --> 00:01:00,210
Kilowog, break it up.
You, too, Razer.

14
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:01,778
What did I say about
killing each other?

15
00:01:01,846 --> 00:01:04,114
Come on, Hal.
We're just fooling around.

16
00:01:04,182 --> 00:01:05,782
Right?

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,884
The ship's too small
for this nonsense.

18
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:09,719
I want you two to shake hands.

19
00:01:09,787 --> 00:01:12,956
It's an Earth custom to show
there's no hard feelings.

20
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:15,092
Come on. Shake hands.

21
00:01:17,428 --> 00:01:19,062
Not like that.

22
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,699
<i>Attention,
incoming distress call.</i>

23
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:25,802
<i>This is captain Goray of
the container ship Truvedon.</i>

24
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,972
<i>I've struck a pinhole
and unable to proceed.</i>

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,640
<i>One of my engines has failed.</i>

26
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:34,044
<i>The other is at full power,
but it's just slowing the inevitable.</i>

27
00:01:34,112 --> 00:01:35,212
<i>I need help.</i>

28
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:38,782
Aya, hold the transmission.
Could be a trap, Hal.

29
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,317
We get there,
the disabled ship opens up,

30
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:42,085
and the Reds start pouring out.

31
00:01:42,153 --> 00:01:44,688
There are no Red Lanterns
in this sector.

32
00:01:44,755 --> 00:01:47,691
- It's not a trap.
- How do you know?

33
00:01:47,758 --> 00:01:50,026
I was in charge of
setting those traps.

34
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,231
This is Hal Jordan of
the Green Lantern corps.

35
00:01:54,298 --> 00:01:57,100
Sit tight, Truvedon.
We're on our way.

36
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:06,610
I've got two questions:
"A" How far are we from that pinhole?

37
00:02:06,677 --> 00:02:08,879
<i>1.8 teraquads and closing.</i>

38
00:02:08,946 --> 00:02:11,982
Which brings me to "B."
What's a pinhole?

39
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,717
It's a microscopic
black hole at the center

40
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:15,318
of a whirlpool of energy.

41
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:17,120
The closer that ship
gets to the pinhole,

42
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:18,955
the stronger gravity becomes.

43
00:02:19,023 --> 00:02:20,924
It will compress
that cargo ship into a space

44
00:02:20,992 --> 00:02:23,360
tighter than a grub worm's vacuole.

45
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,810
That's close enough, Aya.

46
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:43,580
We don't want to get pulled in, too.
Deploy the tractor beam.

47
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:51,588
<i>Anomalous gravitational
readings are infecting my instruments.</i>

48
00:02:51,656 --> 00:02:52,856
<i>Unable to compensate.</i>

49
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:54,724
Captain, do you have
any tow cables?

50
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:56,593
Deploying them now.

51
00:03:00,198 --> 00:03:02,832
Ah. Heh heh.
Missed.

52
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,701
We'll have to go out
there and attach them to

53
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,970
the interceptor manually.

54
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:10,140
Anomalous gravity always
puts a bug in my britches.

55
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,175
If you don't think
you're up to the task...

56
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:14,044
Just try and keep up, punk.

57
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,179
Green Lanterns train
in variable gravity.

58
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:18,715
Let's see how you fly
when you 1,000 kilos,

59
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:21,017
then 6,000, then 2,000.

60
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:23,253
<i>This is
a dangerous undertaking.</i>

61
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:26,022
<i>Why are we risking
3 lives to save one?</i>

62
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,824
A Green Lantern protects
innocent life even

63
00:03:27,892 --> 00:03:32,729
at the risk of their own.
That's what we do.

64
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:34,297
<i>Oh.</i>

65
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:39,803
Quite... a downdraft!

66
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,671
That's downdraw.

67
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:45,809
You don't make it over the gravity
whirlpool, you're dark matter.

68
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:54,150
[grunting]

69
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:03,159
[groaning]

70
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:19,075
All right, Aya!
Let's haul this baby out.

71
00:04:19,143 --> 00:04:21,811
<i>Warning. Gravitational
pull is too intense.</i>

72
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,814
<i>Cables cannot
withstand the strain.</i>

73
00:04:24,882 --> 00:04:26,983
The ship's stable for now,
but sooner or later,

74
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:29,686
I'm telling you,
it's going in.

75
00:04:29,754 --> 00:04:31,655
We'll have to get
the captain ourselves.

76
00:04:50,474 --> 00:04:52,208
Err.

77
00:04:55,813 --> 00:04:57,080
You could have
given him a hand.

78
00:04:57,148 --> 00:05:01,084
I don't need a recruit on
my 6 and especially not a Red recruit.

79
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:02,152
<i>Down here!</i>

80
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,586
Deal with it.

81
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,857
Thank the grollmother
you're here!

82
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:10,994
I'm at half power and have
no way to pull myself out.

83
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:12,996
Exactly what
are you hauling?

84
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:14,431
Some kind of eggs?

85
00:05:14,498 --> 00:05:16,166
Leave them. With
the refrigeration out,

86
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,867
they're goning to
spoil anyway.

87
00:05:17,935 --> 00:05:19,703
Spoil? It's only
a matter of time

88
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,404
before these things hatch.

89
00:05:21,472 --> 00:05:23,006
Hatch?

90
00:05:27,378 --> 00:05:29,946
I can't tell what kind
of creature's inside.

91
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:34,017
Who cares? Only vermin
and insects hatch from eggs.

92
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:38,722
- I hatched from an egg.
- My point exactly.

93
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:41,157
- Err.
- Ease up.

94
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:44,194
<i>The Truvedon's logs
identify them as Spegnarians.</i>

95
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,730
<i>They are incredibly rare
ever since their planet was</i>

96
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:48,865
<i>devastated by volcanic activity.</i>

97
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:51,334
So these eggs are some
kind of last-ditch colony?

98
00:05:51,402 --> 00:05:52,902
I suppose so.

99
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,904
I was paid to avoid
major shipping lanes.

100
00:05:54,972 --> 00:05:58,908
Well, you sure did that.
Change of plans.

101
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:00,977
We're gonna rescue
every life form here.

102
00:06:01,045 --> 00:06:02,746
It's a waste of time.

103
00:06:02,813 --> 00:06:05,382
He's right.
The starboard engine's dead.

104
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,686
Then we'll restart it.
I'll get the civilian clear.

105
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:12,055
You're leaving me
with him?

106
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:13,723
You two need
some bonding time.

107
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,064
I heard of you Green Lanterns.

108
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:24,834
I know you're brave and all,
but you're crazy to go back.

109
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:27,270
Brave, crazy--
it's a fine line.

110
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:30,273
<i>Green Lantern Hal Jordan,
I have several suggestions to</i>

111
00:06:30,341 --> 00:06:33,376
<i>conserve energy until
the inoperative engine is repaired.</i>

112
00:06:33,444 --> 00:06:35,779
Yeah. That's great, Aya.
Keep us out of the crush zone

113
00:06:35,846 --> 00:06:39,315
for as long as you can.

114
00:06:39,383 --> 00:06:41,317
<i>He must not have heard me.</i>

115
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,288
Engine room's this way.

116
00:06:45,356 --> 00:06:49,259
This way.
That's the main power line.

117
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,728
As if you know how
a cargo ship works.

118
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:53,863
It's not some Red Lantern
death ride made ou

119
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:57,434
of lead foil and scrap wire.
And stay in front of me.

120
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,541
How's that phony
ring holding up?

121
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:08,111
Without a Red Lantern battery,
eventually its charge will die.

122
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:10,079
Huh. Sooner the better.

123
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:15,118
But for now as long as I feel rage,
it's as strong as yours.

124
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:17,487
[rumble]

125
00:07:17,555 --> 00:07:21,157
Whoa!

126
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:22,392
Err!

127
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,262
I hope you're good at maakila.

128
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,931
That wasn't me.

129
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:30,133
This ship is falling to pieces,
and I'm sick of your

130
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:32,702
self-righteous braying,
you fat, green oaf!

131
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:38,575
Aah!

132
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:01,464
You kids stop that now, or I'm turning
this ship right around.

133
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:04,067
Isn't that exactly
what we're trying to do?

134
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:06,970
Try something like that
again, and I'm blowing

135
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:10,406
my ring charge on you,
pinhole or no pinhole.

136
00:08:10,474 --> 00:08:11,908
I'm not afraid to die.

137
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:13,309
[boom]

138
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:15,812
You should be.
You'll live longer.

139
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,785
Unh!

140
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:28,525
Huh?

141
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,426
Hello? Can you hear me?

142
00:08:30,494 --> 00:08:33,429
<i>Start the engine now,
or both ships are going in.</i>

143
00:08:33,497 --> 00:08:36,032
Goray, why is
the computer offline?

144
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,601
Aya, are you there?
Aya!

145
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,903
<i>What happened to her?</i>

146
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,639
I don't care!
We're out of time!

147
00:08:42,706 --> 00:08:44,173
Err!

148
00:08:49,146 --> 00:08:51,347
Wait, captain.
Ease off that winch.

149
00:08:56,654 --> 00:08:58,154
Unh!

150
00:09:05,362 --> 00:09:06,796
We're going in!

151
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,981
The pinhole's overpowering
the ship's autograv.

152
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:20,316
Hold on!

153
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:43,740
Unh!

154
00:09:46,143 --> 00:09:48,344
[metal creaking]

155
00:10:00,491 --> 00:10:02,225
There.
It's braced for now.

156
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:04,494
But we're on the lip,
almost in the crush zone.

157
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:08,364
- Let's get out of here.
- Not without the eggs.

158
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:13,402
Where are you going?

159
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,271
To buy us some time.

160
00:10:19,376 --> 00:10:21,811
Errrr!

161
00:10:34,424 --> 00:10:35,825
Unh!

162
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:42,999
I'll keep you out of
the hole as long as I can.

163
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:46,803
Fix that engine, and,
Jordan, watch your back.

164
00:10:50,474 --> 00:10:54,544
It's hopeless. Kilowog's a fool!
He'll die out there.

165
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,347
[grunting]

166
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:12,962
[grunting]

167
00:11:28,545 --> 00:11:32,548
You see that?
The eggs are hatching.

168
00:11:32,616 --> 00:11:34,584
Let's keep moving.

169
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:43,559
They're eating
the power lines!

170
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:50,266
My constructs don't
even slow them down.

171
00:11:53,704 --> 00:11:54,737
Mine do.

172
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:56,172
Hey, hey, hey.
Remember?

173
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,508
Incredibly rare species?

174
00:11:59,576 --> 00:12:01,210
What's the hold up in there?

175
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:04,146
Hatchlings. They're eating
through the power cables.

176
00:12:04,214 --> 00:12:06,549
Don't stop unless you
want to get a lot thinner.

177
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:18,461
[groaning]

178
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,665
Navigation. Hello?

179
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:24,667
<i>Hello?
Is anybody out there?</i>

180
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:27,236
Goray, you're alive.

181
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:29,138
Tell Aya to bring
the ship closer.

182
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,108
Ring's almost empty.
I need her to spell me.

183
00:12:32,175 --> 00:12:35,745
Your nav computer must
be damaged, not responding,

184
00:12:35,812 --> 00:12:37,613
but I'll help.

185
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,520
[groaning]

186
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,457
Oh.

187
00:12:52,729 --> 00:12:55,598
Ooh! Better not
touch that again.

188
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,366
Oh, great!

189
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,611
They're moving past us.

190
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:13,149
If they start eating the engine
before we get there, it's over.

191
00:13:13,216 --> 00:13:14,884
We need a shortcut.

192
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:20,289
It's less cluttered
out here.

193
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:23,759
Yes. We'll have a nice, clear
plummet into the pinhole.

194
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:40,843
How you doing, buddy?

195
00:13:40,911 --> 00:13:42,878
Errrrr!

196
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,450
Aah!

197
00:13:47,517 --> 00:13:48,751
Aaaah!

198
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:50,419
Razer!

199
00:14:08,338 --> 00:14:09,839
More hatchlings.

200
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,642
We're already outnumbered.

201
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,812
Think of how bad it will be once
the rest of the eggs open.

202
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,447
Look. I have no problem
bringing a Red Lantern onto

203
00:14:18,515 --> 00:14:21,717
the team, but I will not
tolerate pessimists.

204
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:35,264
- They've doomed us all.
- What now?

205
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:39,535
This engine isn't just offline.
It's frozen solid.

206
00:14:39,603 --> 00:14:41,537
Those alien hatchlings ate
through the lines

207
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:43,839
that power the heaters!

208
00:14:43,907 --> 00:14:45,875
It would take a team
of engineers to restart it

209
00:14:45,942 --> 00:14:49,211
before we collapse
into the pinhole.

210
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,981
We don't have a team
of engineers or time.

211
00:15:06,316 --> 00:15:08,217
Razer, let's light this candle.

212
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:10,453
You want us to fire a frozen engine?

213
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,456
The explosion will be spectacular.

214
00:15:13,523 --> 00:15:15,224
He's right, Hal.

215
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:18,160
If we start going in, Kilowog,
I want you to cut us loose.

216
00:15:18,228 --> 00:15:19,361
Not happening.

217
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:22,264
You go, we all go,
and the worst part is

218
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:24,133
that the captain
who can't fly straight

219
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:27,636
gets to keep the interceptor.

220
00:15:27,704 --> 00:15:29,338
Your stubborn friend is right.

221
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:35,077
I can't fix this, not without
another 5 pairs of hands.

222
00:15:35,145 --> 00:15:36,579
We're not giving up.

223
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:38,547
Yell about the unfairness
of it all afterward.

224
00:15:38,615 --> 00:15:40,249
Then we'll go down fighting.

225
00:15:40,317 --> 00:15:42,885
At least my Red energy
makes a dent in them.

226
00:15:42,953 --> 00:15:45,821
That's right. Green energy
doesn't affect them.

227
00:15:51,094 --> 00:15:54,663
Wait, stop. Maybe I can get
you those 10 hands, Razer.

228
00:15:58,535 --> 00:15:59,902
What are you doing?

229
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,370
Those things didn't
come from the eggs.

230
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:03,005
They came from the interceptor.

231
00:16:03,073 --> 00:16:05,307
- They're Aya.
- You're deranged.

232
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,443
Aya's been gone since
before the bugs showed up.

233
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:09,945
Somehow she must have put
herself into these little bots

234
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:11,280
and snuck on board.

235
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:13,249
But they ate the power lines.

236
00:16:13,316 --> 00:16:16,719
She was shutting down nonessential
systems to save power.

237
00:16:26,997 --> 00:16:29,131
[ice cracks]

238
00:16:42,245 --> 00:16:45,481
- Both engines are up.
- Aya, full reverse!

239
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:03,165
Even with the engines back online,
we're past the point of no return.

240
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:05,234
I live past the point
of no return.

241
00:17:05,302 --> 00:17:07,670
Express elevator going down.

242
00:17:28,425 --> 00:17:31,727
Not a bad shot for a Red.

243
00:17:35,198 --> 00:17:37,366
[grunting]

244
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,084
It's no use!

245
00:17:55,151 --> 00:17:57,319
We don't have enough
power to pull away!

246
00:17:57,387 --> 00:17:58,988
I'm not trying to pull away.

247
00:17:59,055 --> 00:18:00,689
I'm gonna fly this baby
right at it.

248
00:18:00,757 --> 00:18:02,358
You're going to what?

249
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:04,226
If I can fly with
the current of the pinhole,

250
00:18:04,294 --> 00:18:05,561
maybe I can generate
enough velocity

251
00:18:05,629 --> 00:18:07,463
to slingshot us out of here.

252
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,188
Aagh!

253
00:18:33,256 --> 00:18:35,624
Come on. Hold together.

254
00:18:48,405 --> 00:18:51,307
Yeah, baby!
Still got it.

[chattering]

256
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:16,632
Well, what do you know?
So that's my cargo.

257
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,734
Cargo, huh?
Heh heh heh.

258
00:19:18,802 --> 00:19:20,436
Look at you.

259
00:19:20,503 --> 00:19:22,771
Heh heh. There's a few more
of these rascals running

260
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,740
around that tub of yours.

261
00:19:26,443 --> 00:19:27,710
Err.

262
00:19:27,777 --> 00:19:30,379
And to think, I was
going to abandon them.

263
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:52,735
You were foolishly brave today.

264
00:19:52,802 --> 00:19:58,507
Yeah. Well, back at you.
Nice job saving me.

265
00:19:58,575 --> 00:20:01,343
Thanks.

266
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:02,678
And thank you, Aya.

267
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:04,546
We'd all be feeling pretty
cramped right now

268
00:20:04,614 --> 00:20:06,248
if it wasn't for you coming out
of your shell like that.

I'm not done.

It was dangerous to up
and leave your post.

272
00:20:12,288 --> 00:20:14,223
We need to set a few
parameters, young lady.

innocent life, even</i>

<i>at the risk of their own, correct?</i>

275
00:20:18,895 --> 00:20:20,329
Wait. Wait a minute.

276
00:20:20,397 --> 00:20:22,631
Aya, you do understand
you're a navcom,

277
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:26,335
not a Green Lantern, right?
You can't be a GL.

278
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:27,770
<i>Why not?</i>

279
00:20:27,837 --> 00:20:30,372
Well, first off,
the ring's got to pick you.

280
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,408
- Why?
- Help me out.

00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:33,876
Oh, no. No.
I want to hear this.

282
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:36,645
- Red?
- Leave me out of it.

283
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:39,615
Look. Green Lanterns
positively got to have

284
00:20:39,682 --> 00:20:43,419
a physical body to walk around
and interact with people,

285
00:20:43,486 --> 00:20:45,788
not a bunch of creepy bugs.
