1
00:00:07,293 --> 00:00:09,409  X1:298 X2:418 Y1:495 Y2:516
Godfellas

2
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:47,521  X1:259 X2:458 Y1:061 Y2:126
- Space pirates!
- Space pirates?

3
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:50,008  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:061 Y2:087
You know, pirates, but in space.

4
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:00,932  X1:258 X2:453 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>Avast, mateys.</i>

5
00:01:01,093 --> 00:01:04,051  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:061 Y2:126
Electronically transfer
your space doubloons...

6
00:01:04,213 --> 00:01:08,365  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:061 Y2:126
...afore I send thee
to Davey Jarg's locker!

7
00:01:11,653 --> 00:01:15,805  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:061 Y2:126
Hey! Keep it down, you kids!
I'm trying to take a nap!

8
00:01:24,573 --> 00:01:27,645  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:495 Y2:516
Come on. Come on.

9
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:35,568  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:061 Y2:087
Make Bender take a nap in a tube.

10
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:41,009  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:061 Y2:127
Come back when I've had
some sleep, baby.

11
00:01:47,893 --> 00:01:51,010  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:451 Y2:516
Fry to battle stations.
Fire torpedo three.

12
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:54,171  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:061 Y2:087
Firing torpedo number three.

13
00:02:02,693 --> 00:02:05,924  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:061 Y2:122
That's not torpedo three!
Not at all!

14
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:09,881  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:490 Y2:516
Damn you, Fry and Lee... la!

15
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:16,446  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:061 Y2:126
Too late I realize that me children
are me only real treasures.

16
00:02:19,293 --> 00:02:23,002  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:490 Y2:516
Help! Mechanical man overboard!

17
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:25,044  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:493 Y2:516
Go after him, Leela.

18
00:02:27,173 --> 00:02:29,812  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:061 Y2:121
We were going full speed
when we fired him...

19
00:02:30,053 --> 00:02:31,964  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:489 Y2:516
...so he's going faster than that.

20
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:36,126  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:450 Y2:516
We can't catch him even if we
rub the engine with cheetah blood?

21
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,324  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:489 Y2:516
I don't know how to say this...

22
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:42,372  X1:154 X2:566 Y1:451 Y2:516
...but Bender is doomed to drift
through space. Forever.

23
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:47,968  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:490 Y2:516
He always wanted to drift forever...

24
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:50,931  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:490 Y2:516
...but through the American Southwest.

25
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:54,972  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm going too fast.
I've gotta lose momentum.

26
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:09,764  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm gonna spend eternity alone
with barely any swag.

27
00:03:11,453 --> 00:03:16,049  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:456 Y2:516
Hey universe, check out the dude
with the Rolex.

28
00:03:16,373 --> 00:03:21,572  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:456 Y2:516
Wow, ostentatious. Except what good
is a candelabra without...?

29
00:03:21,773 --> 00:03:24,571  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:493 Y2:516
Wait, I know.

30
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:29,286  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:490 Y2:516
Ah, the pity.

31
00:03:29,453 --> 00:03:33,605  X1:156 X2:558 Y1:451 Y2:516
Fated to drift forever through
the void as gravity's plaything.

32
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:36,606  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:490 Y2:516
Oh, cruel fate, to be thusly boned.

33
00:03:36,853 --> 00:03:41,802  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:456 Y2:516
Ask not for whom the bone bones.
It bones for thee.

34
00:03:43,013 --> 00:03:45,402  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:490 Y2:516
The only thing that keeps me sane...

35
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:51,762  X1:129 X2:585 Y1:451 Y2:516
...is the thought that I have all
eternity in which to perfect my art.

36
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:57,365  X1:289 X2:426 Y1:490 Y2:516
Damn you!

37
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:15,211  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:450 Y2:516
Now, when I'm found in a million years,
people will know what the score was.

38
00:04:15,453 --> 00:04:18,206  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:489 Y2:516
Hey, what's bombarding me?

39
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:20,724  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:493 Y2:516
Oh, no, an asteroid field.

40
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:24,966  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:451 Y2:516
If even a pea-sized asteroid goes
through my skull...

41
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:27,488  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:490 Y2:516
...it could hurt slightly.

42
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:35,363  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:456 Y2:516
Well, that was fun.
Now for eons of loneliness.

43
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:51,962  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:456 Y2:516
Fellow Shrimpkins, behold him
that hath taken us onto his breast.

44
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:53,931  X1:278 X2:437 Y1:490 Y2:516
Holy <i>frijoles.</i>

45
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:59,161  X1:120 X2:594 Y1:490 Y2:516
All bow before the great Metal Lord.

46
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:05,771  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:451 Y2:516
Worshipers? This ought to liven up
my endless tragic voyage.

47
00:05:11,693 --> 00:05:15,811  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:456 Y2:516
- All hail the Metal Lord.
- So hailed.

48
00:05:16,013 --> 00:05:19,528  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:455 Y2:516
Those peewees think I'm God, huh?
Hard to blame them.

49
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:27,167  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:456 Y2:516
- I am the Metal Lord. Who are you?
- I am called Malachi.

50
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:30,729  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:451 Y2:516
It means
"He who really loves the Metal Lord."

51
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:36,087  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:451 Y2:516
Listen here, time for a religious
donation. Hand over your wallet!

52
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:38,887  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:490 Y2:516
But we are a poor and simple folk.

53
00:05:39,053 --> 00:05:41,886  X1:257 X2:458 Y1:490 Y2:516
Poor? Oh, crap!

54
00:05:45,853 --> 00:05:49,562  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:451 Y2:516
Pity me not, for I am richened
by the love of my family.

55
00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:56,167  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:061 Y2:126
- What art thou doing, Malachi Jr.?
- I'm practicing to hug Daddy.

56
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:01,013  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:490 Y2:516
Gag unto me with a spoon.

57
00:06:01,253 --> 00:06:04,165  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:455 Y2:516
It's time I laid down
a few commandments.

58
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:08,452  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:456 Y2:516
You got a chisel?
Take this down. Number one...

59
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:10,605  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:493 Y2:516
Behold, the one commandment:

60
00:06:12,053 --> 00:06:13,645  X1:246 X2:470 Y1:495 Y2:516
Make it a double!

61
00:06:15,813 --> 00:06:20,409  X1:096 X2:620 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Can you find him, professor?
- The Smell-a-Scope isn't strong enough.

62
00:06:20,653 --> 00:06:26,569  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:516
Bender's odor is so mild, it's
being overpowered by local sources.

63
00:06:26,813 --> 00:06:29,850  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:451 Y2:516
Hooray!
People are paying attention to me.

64
00:06:35,773 --> 00:06:38,048  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:451 Y2:516
Fry, we brought someone
to cheer you up.

65
00:06:38,213 --> 00:06:43,082  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:451 Y2:516
His name is Helper. He is eager
to be your new best friend.

66
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:45,323  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hello, chum. Miss your buddy?

67
00:06:45,493 --> 00:06:47,324  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:454 Y2:516
- Have a pudding pop.
- No, l...

68
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:50,644  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Want to go to an amusement park?
- Well, okay.

69
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:54,692  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Have fun. Hey, I heard Bender's back.
- What? Really?

70
00:06:54,893 --> 00:06:58,647  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:451 Y2:516
No. I just thought you would
enjoy that for a moment.

71
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:18,205  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:490 Y2:516
Microbrewed. My guys did all right.

72
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:22,765  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:450 Y2:516
I think I'll make my countenance
to shine down upon them.

73
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:29,251  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:450 Y2:516
Good work. There's no slowing down
with the Metal Lord tonight.

74
00:07:29,453 --> 00:07:34,573  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Yes, tonight is kind of special.
- Did you rip off your arm as a joke?

75
00:07:34,773 --> 00:07:40,006  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:451 Y2:516
Nay. Like most of your followers, I
was maimed building the great brewery.

76
00:07:42,013 --> 00:07:45,005  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:451 Y2:516
Others died from the fumes
it spewed forth.

77
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:50,532  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:451 Y2:516
And, of course, the liquor industry
attracted organized crime.

78
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:00,805  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:489 Y2:516
It's all my fault.

79
00:08:01,053 --> 00:08:07,447  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:451 Y2:516
Malachi, tell thy people that
the Lord is moved by their plight.

80
00:08:25,453 --> 00:08:30,607  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Malachi Jr.! No!
- Daddy, I can't hold much longer.

81
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:36,450  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:451 Y2:516
- My arms are tired from hugging.
- Save him. Save my son, Metal Lord.

82
00:08:36,653 --> 00:08:39,372  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:490 Y2:516
This looks like a job for God.

83
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:51,804  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:451 Y2:516
What the...? Malachi, what manner
of deal is this with the chanting?

84
00:08:52,013 --> 00:08:56,643  X1:107 X2:607 Y1:451 Y2:516
They saw you save my son. Now
everyone prays for their own miracles.

85
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:58,889  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:490 Y2:516
Very well. What do they want?

86
00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:02,972  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:451 Y2:516
The people of that village
pray for wealth.

87
00:09:13,973 --> 00:09:16,646  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:456 Y2:516
That was a practice miracle.
Who's next?

88
00:09:17,853 --> 00:09:19,525  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:490 Y2:516
They pray for sunlight...

89
00:09:19,773 --> 00:09:23,686  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:451 Y2:516
...so their barley might make
a more refreshing beer.

90
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:27,528  X1:171 X2:543 Y1:490 Y2:516
Very well. Let there be light.

91
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:33,365  X1:304 X2:412 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Yippee!
- Hooray!

92
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:38,562  X1:257 X2:458 Y1:490 Y2:516
I got it. I got it.

93
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:46,562  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:516
When you're writing the Bible, you
might want to omit that last miracle.

94
00:09:51,613 --> 00:09:53,729  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:490 Y2:516
He decided not to let go.

95
00:09:58,613 --> 00:10:01,002  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:061 Y2:122
I can't believe you're gone.
I won't!

96
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:05,007  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:061 Y2:127
If I can't reach you physically,
I'll try something crazy.

97
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:13,012  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's my story,
Father Changstein el Gamahl.

98
00:10:13,253 --> 00:10:18,850  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Can religion help me find my friend?
- We could join together in prayer.

99
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:22,685  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:456 Y2:516
- But is there anything useful we can do?
- No.

100
00:10:23,213 --> 00:10:28,765  X1:120 X2:594 Y1:451 Y2:516
Sure, I hold séance, channel
your friend. No problem. Insert coin.

101
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:34,646  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:490 Y2:516
I am your friend, Bonder.

102
00:10:34,853 --> 00:10:40,246  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Bonder? Is it really you?
- Yes. I am fine. Give the gypsy $ 1 0.

103
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:44,844  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:455 Y2:516
Wait, Bender's name isn't Bonder,
it's Bender. You're a fraud.

104
00:10:45,053 --> 00:10:49,126  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:451 Y2:516
- You want false hope or not?
- Only if there's no real hope.

105
00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:54,652  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:456 Y2:516
There is perhaps one way. Have you
heard of the Monks of the Shubah?

106
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:58,368  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I've not heard of them.
- They are an ancient order...

107
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:02,003  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:451 Y2:516
...that believes God exists
in the depths of space.

108
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:05,290  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:451 Y2:516
They have built
a powerful radio telescope...

109
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:08,251  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:456 Y2:516
...high in the Himalayas
to search for him.

110
00:11:08,453 --> 00:11:12,207  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:516
- They'd let me use it to find Bender?
- What am I, psychic?

111
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:15,171  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:451 Y2:516
I mean, yes.
I'm sure they will. Yes.

112
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:33,885  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:490 Y2:516
Oh, Metal Lord, hear my prayer!

113
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,448  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:493 Y2:516
Yes, Malachi. What is it this time?

114
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:40,168  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:451 Y2:516
The infidels on your back
no longer believe in you.

115
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,642  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:490 Y2:516
They say their prayers go unheeded.

116
00:11:42,853 --> 00:11:47,210  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:451 Y2:516
How am I supposed to hear prayers
coming out of my ass?

117
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:52,322  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:451 Y2:516
They talk of war against the faithful.
I beseech thee, rise up against them.

118
00:11:52,493 --> 00:11:55,451  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:456 Y2:516
Smite someone
who deserves it for once.

119
00:11:55,613 --> 00:11:59,003  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:451 Y2:516
Every time I interfere,
I only make things worse.

120
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:03,451  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:455 Y2:516
- It's best to solve your own problems.
- But Metal Lord...

121
00:12:03,653 --> 00:12:07,282  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:456 Y2:516
What part of nay
doesn't thou understand?

122
00:12:09,453 --> 00:12:14,208  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm outfitting an expedition
to the Himalayas. I'll need a coat.

123
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:20,329  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:451 Y2:516
I miss Bender almost half as much
as you do, but it's hopeless.

124
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:23,445  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:450 Y2:516
You can't give up hope just
because it's hopeless.

125
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:27,367  X1:174 X2:540 Y1:451 Y2:516
You gotta hope even more
and cover your ears and go:

126
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,083  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:453 Y2:516
- I'd also like a pack mule!
- At once, sir!

127
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:36,242  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:489 Y2:516
Well, you won't listen to reason...

128
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:39,246  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:455 Y2:516
...so I'll listen to idiotic-ness
and come too.

129
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:42,565  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:489 Y2:516
But we'll need a Sherpa to guide us.

130
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:50,803  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:450 Y2:516
Now that's one Bible
that doesn't disappoint.

131
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:55,967  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:516
Looks like society's running pretty
well without my meddling in...

132
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:05,370  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:451 Y2:516
Atomic bombs? Those unbelievers from
my backside found my nuclear pile.

133
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:08,565  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:451 Y2:516
Fear not, Lord.
We shall be with you soon.

134
00:13:08,773 --> 00:13:11,890  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:451 Y2:516
This is the maximum level
of being with me!

135
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:18,168  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:456 Y2:516
We will solve our own problems.
It is time to convert the unbelievers.

136
00:13:18,373 --> 00:13:20,887  X1:216 X2:499 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Convert them?
- To radioactive vapor!

137
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:35,167  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:489 Y2:516
Look, Daddy, I'm hugging God.

138
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:40,529  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:456 Y2:516
Maybe if I hug him real hard,
he'll save us from...

139
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,605  X1:337 X2:379 Y1:495 Y2:516
No!

140
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:45,367  X1:271 X2:444 Y1:493 Y2:516
Oh, it tickles.

141
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:58,371  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:451 Y2:516
Hello? Is anyone still alive?
How about in the porno theater?

142
00:13:58,533 --> 00:13:59,966  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:494 Y2:516
Don't be embarrassed.

143
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:04,685  X1:205 X2:509 Y1:489 Y2:516
They're dead. All dead.

144
00:14:05,253 --> 00:14:10,885  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:451 Y2:516
Who would have known playing God
could have such terrible consequences?

145
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:22,531  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
If I die of exhaustion, make sure my
body freezes in a dignified position.

146
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:25,253  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:451 Y2:516
None of that
"huddled for warmth" crap.

147
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:33,131  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:490 Y2:516
Behold! The monastery of the Shubah.

148
00:14:33,293 --> 00:14:36,171  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:451 Y2:516
I must leave.
I am not holy enough to enter.

149
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,766  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:490 Y2:516
Okay.

150
00:14:43,973 --> 00:14:46,726  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:489 Y2:516
Looks rickety. We'd better test it.

151
00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:54,970  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>Welcome to our monastery.</i>

152
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:59,490  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Please stand to one side</i>
<i>to let faster pilgrims by.</i>

153
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:15,602  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:516
Hey! That galaxy's signaling in binary.
I've gotta signal back!

154
00:15:15,773 --> 00:15:20,164  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:451 Y2:516
But I only know enough binary to ask
for the bathroom. Speak English?

155
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,972  X1:297 X2:419 Y1:495 Y2:516
I do now.

156
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,442  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:490 Y2:516
What are you, a galactic computer?

157
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:34,492  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:451 Y2:516
Possible. I am user-friendly,
my good chum.

158
00:15:34,653 --> 00:15:37,213  X1:224 X2:491 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Who built you?
- I have always been.

159
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:41,207  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:490 Y2:516
Oh, my God! Are you God?

160
00:15:41,413 --> 00:15:46,043  X1:126 X2:588 Y1:451 Y2:516
Possible. I do feel compassion
for all living things, my good chum.

161
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:51,567  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:451 Y2:516
But why would God think in binary?
Unless you're not God...

162
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:56,085  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
...but the remains of a computerized
space probe that collided with God!

163
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,011  X1:218 X2:496 Y1:490 Y2:516
That seems probable.

164
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:06,371  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
A member of our brotherhood sits
at the controls constantly...

165
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:09,366  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:490 Y2:516
...scanning the heavens for God.

166
00:16:09,573 --> 00:16:12,690  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:493 Y2:516
There he is! No. No, wait. No.

167
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:16,010  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:451 Y2:516
- How long have you been at it?
- 700 years.

168
00:16:16,253 --> 00:16:19,370  X1:174 X2:540 Y1:450 Y2:516
We've not yet examined
one ten-millionth of the sky.

169
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:23,765  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:456 Y2:516
We will find the Almighty,
even if it takes to the end of time.

170
00:16:23,973 --> 00:16:27,170  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:451 Y2:516
- And then what?
- Then we utter unto him a short prayer.

171
00:16:27,373 --> 00:16:30,888  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:451 Y2:516
See, the telescope is also
an amplifying transmitter.

172
00:16:31,053 --> 00:16:33,886  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Like a giant karaoke machine?
- Not really.

173
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:38,444  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Want to see our giant karaoke machine?
- Not really.

174
00:16:38,853 --> 00:16:40,969  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:489 Y2:516
Finding God, that's important...

175
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:45,968  X1:102 X2:613 Y1:451 Y2:516
...but it might be a treat if you let
me use the telescope to find my friend.

176
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,603  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:450 Y2:516
I don't know what to say,
other than absolutely not!

177
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:54,130  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Your loss is tragic, but our work...
- You can look for God forever.

178
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:57,524  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm just asking for one lifetime
to find my friend!

179
00:16:57,693 --> 00:17:02,403  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:451 Y2:516
He speaks out of love for his friend.
Perhaps that love is God.

180
00:17:02,653 --> 00:17:07,681  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
How convenient. A theory about God
that doesn't require a telescope.

181
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:09,411  X1:240 X2:474 Y1:495 Y2:516
Get back to work!

182
00:17:09,573 --> 00:17:11,848  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:451 Y2:516
That telescope is as much mine
as anybody's!

183
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:15,443  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'll use it with or without
permission!

184
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:22,602  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516
Your order may be famous for martial
arts, but I can clobber any holy man.

185
00:17:22,773 --> 00:17:26,004  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:456 Y2:516
Actually, we only practice
martial arts as meditation.

186
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,164  X1:186 X2:528 Y1:490 Y2:516
We are strictly nonviolent.

187
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,882  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:451 Y2:516
Then get in the laundry room,
or I'll kick your butts!

188
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:37,248  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:456 Y2:516
Oh, this is the worst crazy sect
I've ever been in.

189
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:41,406  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:455 Y2:516
Do you know what I'll do
before I do it?

190
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:44,041  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Yes.
- What if I do something different?

191
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:46,966  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:453 Y2:516
- Then I don't know that.
- Cool, cool.

192
00:17:47,213 --> 00:17:52,367  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:451 Y2:516
- A lot of people pray to you, huh?
- Yes, but so many ask so much...

193
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,081  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:456 Y2:516
...after a while, you just
tune it out.

194
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,324  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:493 Y2:516
You know, I was God once.

195
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,883  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:451 Y2:516
Yes, I saw. You were doing well
until everyone died.

196
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:05,132  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:451 Y2:516
It was awful. I tried helping them.
I tried not helping them.

197
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:10,083  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:516
In the end, I couldn't do any good.
Do you think what I did was wrong?

198
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:14,041  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:451 Y2:516
Right and wrong are words.
What matters is what you do.

199
00:18:14,213 --> 00:18:18,684  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:516
Yeah, I know. That's why I asked
if what I did... Oh, forget it.

200
00:18:18,893 --> 00:18:21,202  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:489 Y2:516
Bender, being God isn't easy.

201
00:18:21,373 --> 00:18:26,163  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
Do too much, people get dependent.
If you do nothing, they lose hope.

202
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:30,451  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:451 Y2:516
You must use a light touch,
like a safecracker or a pickpocket.

203
00:18:30,613 --> 00:18:33,047  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:451 Y2:516
Or a guy who burns a bar
for insurance money!

204
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,807  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:451 Y2:516
Yes, if you make it look like
an electrical thing.

205
00:18:36,053 --> 00:18:41,571  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:450 Y2:516
When you do things right, people won't
be sure you've done anything at all.

206
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:46,528  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:450 Y2:516
Does that mean you wouldn't send me
to Earth, even if I prayed?

207
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:49,964  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:490 Y2:516
Earth? Which way is that?

208
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:52,452  X1:271 X2:444 Y1:494 Y2:516
I don't know.

209
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:55,045  X1:251 X2:466 Y1:495 Y2:516
Bender? Bender?

210
00:18:55,813 --> 00:18:59,601  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:451 Y2:516
Let us out! We cooked our shoes
in the dryer and ate them.

211
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:01,491  X1:242 X2:473 Y1:494 Y2:516
Now we're bored!

212
00:19:03,573 --> 00:19:07,282  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Has anyone out there seen Bender?
<i>- No! Quit asking!</i>

213
00:19:08,253 --> 00:19:12,371  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's been three days. Even if you stay
the rest of your life...

214
00:19:12,533 --> 00:19:17,402  X1:129 X2:585 Y1:451 Y2:516
...there is virtually no chance
of finding him. It's time to give up.

215
00:19:17,653 --> 00:19:21,566  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:516
You're right.
I'm never gonna see him again.

216
00:19:22,173 --> 00:19:25,688  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:456 Y2:516
I know he was evil,
and on more than one occasion...

217
00:19:25,853 --> 00:19:29,084  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:490 Y2:516
...he actually stole my blood.

218
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:33,246  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:493 Y2:516
But still, I wish I had Bender back.

219
00:19:35,613 --> 00:19:37,808  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:495 Y2:516
<i>I wish I had Bender back!</i>

220
00:19:39,453 --> 00:19:40,442  X1:327 X2:391 Y1:495 Y2:516
Huh?

221
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:44,650  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:456 Y2:516
- What? You say something?
- No. No.

222
00:19:44,813 --> 00:19:49,568  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:456 Y2:516
Well, so long.
Remember what we talked about.

223
00:20:02,613 --> 00:20:04,251  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:495 Y2:516
Hot! Hot! Hot!

224
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,923  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:494 Y2:516
Bender! It's a miracle!

225
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:17,165  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
This is, by a wide margin,
the least likely thing ever to happen.

226
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:22,327  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:453 Y2:516
You'll never believe what happened!
First, I was God. Then I met God!

227
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:24,922  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:454 Y2:516
- We locked up some monks!
- Oh, no!

228
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:28,085  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:451 Y2:516
We forgot to let them
out of the laundry room!

229
00:20:28,253 --> 00:20:32,007  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:455 Y2:516
Do we have to? They're monks.
Their God will let them out...

230
00:20:32,213 --> 00:20:34,932  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:456 Y2:516
...or give them more shoes to eat.
- Fat chance!

231
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:38,972  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:450 Y2:516
You can't count on God for jack!
He pretty much told me so!

232
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:43,763  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:453 Y2:516
Now come on! If we don't
save those monks, no one will!

233
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:59,248  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:450 Y2:516
When you do things right, people won't
be sure you've done anything at all.
