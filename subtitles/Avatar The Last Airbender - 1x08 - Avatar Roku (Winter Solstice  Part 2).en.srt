00:00:00,749 --> 00:00:03,121
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:03,122 --> 00:00:04,995
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:04,996 --> 00:00:07,104
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:08,396
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:13,596
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:17,675
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:21,988
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,148
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:29,310
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:31,150
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:33,356
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:37,089
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,712
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,274
Previously on "Avatar"...

15
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:54,456
When the Avatar dies he's reincarnated into the next nation in the cycle.

16
00:00:54,535 --> 00:00:56,999
But there's no one who can teach me how to be the Avatar.

17
00:00:57,086 --> 00:01:00,180
Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me.

18
00:01:00,264 --> 00:01:02,014
The Avatar before you?

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,114
He died over a hundred years ago, how are you supposed to talk to him?

20
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:07,205
There's a temple on a crescent shaped island,...

21
00:01:07,287 --> 00:01:10,451
...and if I go there on the solstice I'll be able to speak with him.

22
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:12,546
But, the solstice is tomorrow.

23
00:01:12,664 --> 00:01:17,961
Yeh, and there's one more problem. The island is in the Fire Nation.

24
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:22,948
Book One: Water | Chapter Eight:
Avatar Roku (Winter Solstice, Part 2)

25
00:01:31,062 --> 00:01:35,303
Let's go Appa! Come on, boy!

26
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:39,981
Look, I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka aren't coming to the Fire Nation with us.

27
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:43,340
If they got hurt, I'd never forgive myself.

28
00:01:43,446 --> 00:01:47,915
So get your big butt off the ground and let's go!

29
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:51,451
I think his big butt is trying to tell you something.

30
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:52,875
Please don't go, Aang.

31
00:01:52,983 --> 00:01:59,238
The world can't afford to lose you to the Fire Nation. Neither can I.

32
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:05,912
But I have to talk to Avatar Roku to find out what my vision means.

33
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:12,988
I need to get to the Fire Temple before the sun sets on the Solstice. That's today.

34
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:17,964
We're not letting you go into the Fire Nation, Aang.

35
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:23,548
At least not without your friends. We got your back.

36
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:28,174
It's a long journey to the Crescent Island.

37
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:32,396
You'll have to fly fast to have any chance of making it before sundown.

38
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:33,625
Good luck.

39
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:34,707
Thank you, for your...

40
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:36,784
Go!

41
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:49,735
Having trouble sleeping? Seen the Avatar lately?

42
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:02,385
Come on, boy! We've got a long way to go! Faster!

43
00:03:05,715 --> 00:03:09,143
Sailing into Fire Nation waters...

44
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,285
...of all the foolish things you have done in your 16 years, Prince Zuko,...

45
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,953
...this is the most foolish.

46
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:18,695
I have no choice, Uncle.

47
00:03:18,802 --> 00:03:23,621
Have you completely forgotten that the Fire Lord banished you?!?!?

48
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:25,227
What if you're caught?

49
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,320
I'm chasing the Avatar. My father will understand why I'm returning home.

50
00:03:29,405 --> 00:03:36,618
You give him too much credit. My brother is not the understanding type.

51
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:42,909
There they are! Helmsman, full steam ahead!

52
00:03:43,137 --> 00:03:44,729
Aang, we got trouble.

53
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:48,217
Yeah, and its gaining fast!

54
00:03:54,381 --> 00:04:01,690
Really, Prince Zuko, couldn't you shoot them down with something more fragrant?

55
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:06,946
On my mark... Fire!

56
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:09,866
Fire ball!

57
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,632
I'm on it!

58
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:19,003
We have to get out of Zuko's range before he shoots another hot stinker at us!

59
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:21,200
Can't you make Appa go any faster?

60
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,450
Yeah, but there's just one little problem.

61
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:26,822
A blockade!

62
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,038
Technically you are still in Earth Kingdom waters.

63
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:37,912
Turn back now and they cannot arrest you.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,105
If we fly north we can go around the Fire Nation ships and avoid the blockade.

65
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:43,472
It's the only way.

66
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:44,797
There's no time.

67
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,389
This is exactly why I didn't want you to come. Its too dangerous.

68
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:50,565
And that's exactly why we're here.

69
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,033
Let's run this blockade.

70
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:56,020
Appa! Yip! Yip!

71
00:04:56,757 --> 00:04:58,316
He's not turning around.

72
00:04:58,395 --> 00:05:04,069
Please Prince Zuko, if the Fire Nation captures you, there is nothing I can do.

73
00:05:04,186 --> 00:05:06,673
Do not follow the Avatar.

74
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,579
I'm sorry, Uncle. Run the blockade!

75
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:19,063
The Avatar... and the banished Prince. This must be my lucky day.

76
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:21,498
Commander Zhao, what are your orders?

77
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,556
Shoot the Bison down, Captain.

78
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:27,725
But there's a Fire Navy ship out there, Sir, one of our own. What if it's hit?

79
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:33,784
So be it. It belongs to a traitor. Ignite!

80
00:05:35,517 --> 00:05:37,756
Launch!!!

81
00:05:58,882 --> 00:06:02,086
Appa! Are you ok?

82
00:06:14,592 --> 00:06:19,576
Prince Zuko, the engines are damaged! We need to stop and make repairs!

83
00:06:19,694 --> 00:06:21,821
Do not stop this ship.

84
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:24,097
Launch!

85
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:47,310
Sokka...!

86
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:10,398
Ready...

87
00:07:14,046 --> 00:07:16,294
Fire!

88
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,763
We made it!!!

89
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:41,171
We got into the Fire Nation... Great...

90
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,562
Where do you think the Avatar is headed, Sir?

91
00:07:43,647 --> 00:07:50,133
I'm not sure. But I bet a certain banished prince will know.

92
00:07:50,768 --> 00:07:52,466
We're on a collision course!

93
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,732
We can make it!

94
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:57,166
The boarding party is ready to apprehend Prince Zuko, Sir.

95
00:07:57,231 --> 00:08:00,491
Wait. Cut the engines. Let them pass.

96
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:02,767
Sir?

97
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:29,436
There it is! The island Roku's dragon took me to!

98
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:36,554
You did it buddy. Nice flying.

99
00:08:36,676 --> 00:08:38,859
Oh! You must be tired!

100
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:44,666
No. I'm good. Refreshed and ready to fight some firebenders.

101
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:47,004
I was talking to Appa.

102
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:51,006
Well, I was talking to Momo.

103
00:08:57,179 --> 00:08:58,762
I don't see any guards.

104
00:08:58,856 --> 00:09:02,549
The Fire Nation must have abandoned the temple when Avatar Roku died.

105
00:09:02,644 --> 00:09:06,388
Its almost sundown. We'd better hurry.

106
00:09:14,508 --> 00:09:18,245
Wait... I think I heard something.

107
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:24,747
We are the Fire Sages. Guardians of the temple of the Avatar.

108
00:09:24,812 --> 00:09:27,181
Great! I am the Avatar.

109
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,268
We know.

110
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:36,258
I'll hold them off. Run!

111
00:09:38,955 --> 00:09:44,073
If the Avatar contacts Roku, there's no telling how powerful the boy will become.

112
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:47,715
Split up and find him!

113
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:50,835
Follow me!

114
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:52,414
Do you know where you're going?

115
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:53,697
Nope!

116
00:09:55,038 --> 00:09:56,402
Wrong way!

117
00:09:56,893 --> 00:09:58,570
Come back!

118
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:07,472
I don't want to fight you. I am a friend.

119
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:11,296
Firebenders aren't our friends.

120
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:14,484
I know why you're here, Avatar.

121
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:15,568
You do?

122
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:21,189
Yes. You wish to speak to Avatar Roku. I can take you to him.

123
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:23,385
How?

124
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:29,534
This way.

125
00:10:31,902 --> 00:10:35,143
Time is running out. Quickly!

126
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:46,177
What's he up to, Uncle? Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me?

127
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,887
Because he wants to follow you.

128
00:10:48,946 --> 00:10:53,978
He knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after... the Avatar.

129
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:59,820
If Zhao wants to follow our trail of smoke, then that's exactly what I'll let him do.

130
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:02,797
Avatar Roku once called this temple his home.

131
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:06,035
He formed these secret passages out of the magma.

132
00:11:06,113 --> 00:11:07,733
Did you know Avatar Roku?

133
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:10,884
No. But my grandfather knew him.

134
00:11:10,972 --> 00:11:15,549
Many generations of Fire Sages guarded this temple long before me.

135
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:19,198
We all have a strong spiritual connection to this place.

136
00:11:19,297 --> 00:11:21,096
Is that how you knew I was coming?

137
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:24,428
A few weeks ago, an amazing thing occurred.

138
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:28,638
The statue of Avatar Roku, its eyes... began to glow!

139
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:33,438
That's when we were at the Air Temple. Avatar Roku's eyes were glowing there too!

140
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:37,777
At that moment, we knew you had returned to the world.

141
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:41,586
If this is the Avatar's temple, why did the Sages attack me?

142
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:47,321
Things have changed. In the past, the Sages were loyal only to the Avatar.

143
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:52,551
When Roku died, the Sages eagerly awaited for the next Avatar to return.

144
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:54,334
But he never came.

145
00:11:54,437 --> 00:11:55,986
They were waiting for me.

146
00:11:56,075 --> 00:11:59,077
Hey, don't feel bad. You're only a hundred years late.

147
00:11:59,173 --> 00:12:02,048
They lost hope the Avatar would ever return.

148
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,873
When Fire Lord Sozen began the war,...

149
00:12:04,978 --> 00:12:09,219
...my grandfather and the other Sages were forced to follow him.

150
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:14,159
I never wanted to serve the Fire Lord. When I learned you were coming,...

151
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:17,001
...I knew I would have to betray the other Sages.

152
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:20,544
Thank you for helping me.

153
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,489
We'll follow these stairs to the sanctuary.

154
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:28,436
Once you're inside, wait for the light to hit Avatar Roku's statue.

155
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:33,800
Only then will you be able to speak with him.

156
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:42,246
No!

157
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:43,553
Shyu, what's wrong?

158
00:12:43,657 --> 00:12:46,908
The sanctuary doors, they're closed.

159
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:50,812
Can't you just open them with firebending? Like you opened that other door?

160
00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:57,129
No. Only a fully realized Avatar is powerful enough to open this door alone.

161
00:12:57,228 --> 00:13:03,841
Otherwise the Sages must open the doors together with five simultaneous fire blasts.

162
00:13:03,932 --> 00:13:10,391
Five fire blasts, huh? I think I can help you out.

163
00:13:11,286 --> 00:13:18,405
Uncle, keep heading north. Zhao will follow the smoke trail while I use it as a cover.

164
00:13:26,136 --> 00:13:28,709
This is a little trick I picked up from my father.

165
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:32,050
I seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing,...

166
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:37,029
...Shyu lights the oil soaked twine and tada! Fake firebending!

167
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:39,540
You've really outdone yourself this time, Sokka.

168
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:44,051
This might actually work.

169
00:13:44,326 --> 00:13:50,743
The Sages will hear the explosions, so as soon as they go off, you rush in.

170
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,020
Its almost sunset. Are you ready?

171
00:13:53,122 --> 00:13:55,152
Definitely.

172
00:14:09,937 --> 00:14:13,342
They're still locked.

173
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:17,913
It didn't work.

174
00:14:25,395 --> 00:14:29,727
Why won't it open! Aargh!

175
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:33,148
Aang, stop! There's nothing else we can do.

176
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:36,796
I'm sorry I put you through all this for nothing.

177
00:14:36,906 --> 00:14:42,144
I don't get it. That blast looked as strong as any firebending I've seen.

178
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:44,842
Sokka! You're a genius!

179
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:48,353
Wait, how is Sokka genius? His plan didn't even work.

180
00:14:48,465 --> 00:14:51,054
Come on Aang, let her dream.

181
00:14:51,168 --> 00:14:56,501
You're right. Sokka's plan didn't work... but it looks like it did.

182
00:14:56,597 --> 00:15:00,524
Did the definition of "genius" change in the last hundred years?

183
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,585
Come Quickly! The Avatar has entered the sanctuary.

184
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,993
How did he get in?

185
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:10,606
I don't know. But look at the scorch marks and down there!

186
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:19,382
He's inside. Open the doors immediately before he contacts Avatar Roku.

187
00:15:31,781 --> 00:15:33,711
It's the Avatar's lemur!

188
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:40,100
He must have crawled through the pipes! We've been tricked!

189
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:44,123
Now, Aang!

190
00:15:44,298 --> 00:15:47,878
Aang! Now's your chance!

191
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,645
The Avatar's coming with me!

192
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:58,658
Close the doors! Quickly!

193
00:16:04,691 --> 00:16:06,348
Go!

194
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,776
He made it!

195
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:32,913
The light hits the statue and I talk to Roku. So why isn't anything happening?

196
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,812
Why isn't it working? It's sealed shut!

197
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:46,001
It must have been the light. Avatar Roku doesn't want us inside.

198
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:49,916
Why isn't anything happening? I don't know what I'm doing!

199
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:56,115
All I know is airbending! Please, Avatar Roku, talk to me!

200
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:08,565
It's good to see you, Aang. What took you so long?

201
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:12,821
Why did you help the Avatar?

202
00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:20,448
Because it was once the Sages' duty. It is still our duty.

203
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:26,094
What a moving and heartfelt performance.

204
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:31,731
I'm certain the Fire Lord will understand when you explain why you betrayed him.

205
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:33,529
Commander Zhao...

206
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:40,684
And Prince Zuko, it was a noble effort. But your little smoke screen didn't work.

207
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:45,587
Two traitors, in one day, the Fire Lord will be pleased.

208
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:49,937
You're too late, Zhao. The Avatar's inside and the doors are sealed.

209
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:56,865
No matter. Sooner or later, he has to come out.

210
00:17:58,442 --> 00:18:02,503
I have something very important to tell you, Aang.

211
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:09,389
That is why, when you were in the spirit world, I sent my dragon to find you.

212
00:18:09,493 --> 00:18:12,362
Is it about that vision? The one with the comet?

213
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,556
Yes.

214
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:14,903
What does it mean?

215
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:21,418
One hundred years ago, Fire Lord Sozen used that comet to begin the war.

216
00:18:21,504 --> 00:18:25,972
He and his firebending army harnessed its incredible power...

217
00:18:26,061 --> 00:18:30,293
...and dealt a deadly first strike against the other nations.

218
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:32,507
So the comet made them stronger?

219
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:36,530
Yes. Stronger than you could even imagine.

220
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,360
But that happened a hundred years ago.

221
00:18:38,469 --> 00:18:40,843
What does the comet have to do with the war now?

222
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:46,255
Listen carefully. Sozen's comet will return by the end of the summer.

223
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:54,083
And Fire Lord Ozai will use its power to finish the war once and for all.

224
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:59,893
If he succeeds, even the Avatar won't be able to restore balance to the world.

225
00:18:59,996 --> 00:19:05,948
Aang, you must defeat the Fire Lord before the comet arrives.

226
00:19:06,065 --> 00:19:10,057
But I haven't even started learning waterbending, not to mention earth and fire.

227
00:19:10,161 --> 00:19:14,443
Mastering the elements takes years of discipline and practice.

228
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:22,477
But if the world is to survive, you must do it by summer's end.

229
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:32,159
When those doors open, unleash all your fire power.

230
00:19:32,288 --> 00:19:34,001
How's Aang going to make it out of this?

231
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,994
How're we going to make it out of this?

232
00:19:38,622 --> 00:19:42,078
What if I can't master all the elements in time? What if I fail?

233
00:19:42,218 --> 00:19:48,073
I know you can do it Aang, for you have done it before.

234
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:54,925
The solstice is ending. We must go our separate ways... for now.

235
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:57,406
But I won't be able to come back to the temple.

236
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,268
What if I have questions? How will I talk to you?

237
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:10,313
I am a part of you. When you need to talk to me again, you will find a way.

238
00:20:10,446 --> 00:20:14,340
A great danger awaits you at the temple.

239
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:20,615
I can help you face the threat. But only if you are ready.

240
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:23,201
I'm ready.

241
00:20:32,352 --> 00:20:35,023
Ready...

242
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:36,976
No! Aang!

243
00:20:37,122 --> 00:20:39,008
Fire!

244
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:47,601
Avatar Roku!

245
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:02,284
Avatar Roku's going to destroy the temple! We have to get out of here!

246
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:04,825
Not without Aang!

247
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,584
We got your back.

248
00:21:35,683 --> 00:21:37,721
Thanks. Where's Shyu?

249
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:39,996
I don't know.

250
00:22:04,388 --> 00:22:11,391
No prince. No Avatar. Apparently the only thing I do have is five traitors.

251
00:22:11,503 --> 00:22:14,239
But Commander, only Shyu helped the Avatar.

252
00:22:14,388 --> 00:22:16,737
Save your stories for the Fire Lord.

253
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:24,650
As far as I'm concerned, you're all guilty! Take them to the prison hold!

254
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:36,849
