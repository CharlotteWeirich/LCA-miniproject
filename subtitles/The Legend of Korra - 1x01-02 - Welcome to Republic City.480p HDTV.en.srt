1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,360
Earth.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,730
Fire.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,240
Air.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,000
Water.

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,860
When I was a boy, my father, Avatar Aang,

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,600
told me the story of how he and his friends
heroically ended the Hundred Year War.

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,220
Avatar Aang and Fire Lord
Zuko transformed the Fire

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,630
Nation colonies into the
United Republic of Nations,

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,340
a society where benders and
non-benders from all over the world,

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,970
could live and thrive together
in peace and harmony.

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,360
They named the capital of this
great land, Republic City.

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,240
Avatar Aang accomplished many
remarkable things in his life.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,930
But sadly, his time in
this world came to an end.

14
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:00,180
And like the cycle of the seasons,
the cycle of the Avatar, began anew.

15
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,730
The White Lotus has honored my
family by coming. Thank you.

16
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,420
Welcome.

17
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,350
We have investigated many claims,
both here and in the Northern Tribe.

18
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,000
All have turned out to be false.

19
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,560
Then you should be happy to know,
your search has come to an end.

20
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,080
What makes you so sure
your daughter is the one?

21
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,920
Korra! Please come in here!

22
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,140
I'm the Avatar! You gotta deal with it!

23
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,500
She's strong.

24
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,740
She lacks restraint.

25
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,610
Hey, why all the doom and gloom, people?

26
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,240
We should be celebrating!
Three elements down, one to go!

27
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,020
You're getting ahead of
yourself as usual, Korra.

28
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,800
We haven't decided if you passed
your firebending test yet.

29
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,500
Ever since you were a little girl, you've
excelled at the physical side of bending,

30
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,780
but completely ignored the spiritual side.
The Avatar must master both.

31
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,020
I haven't ignored it, it just
doesn't come as easy to me.

32
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,040
But that's why I should start training with
Tenzin immediately. He's Mister Spiritual.

33
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,610
Do you think she's ready, Master Katara?

34
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,750
Yes. If anyone can teach her what
she needs to learn, it's Tenzin.

35
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:48,480
Very well, Korra. It's time for you
to begin your airbending training.

36
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,560
Yes! Finally!

37
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,270
I mean, thank you all for believing in me.

38
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,250
Naga, you should have seen it!

39
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,560
I kicked some firebender
butt, and I passed!

40
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,210
Tenzin will be here in a few days.

41
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,600
Just taking Naga out for a stroll.

42
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,900
Don't worry, we're not going far.

43
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,480
Naga, go!

44
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,070
Better girl. Go! Go! Go!

45
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,810
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Are we there yet? It looks like we're there.

46
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,400
I know it, this is very familiar!
Are we here yet? Are we here yet?

47
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,410
Ooh, please tell me we're here!

48
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,510
Yes, Ikki, as I've been telling
you for the last fifteen minutes,

49
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,530
we are, finally, here.

50
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,020
Hello, mother.

51
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,850
I can't tell you how happy I am to see you.
Please, help me.

52
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,210
Unhand me, strange woman!

53
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,960
That's your grandmother, Meelo.

54
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,500
It's so good to see all of you.

55
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,080
Gran Gran, I've been reading
all about your old adventures.

56
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,310
I've been dying to ask you,
what happened to Zuko's mom?

57
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,210
Well, Jinora, it's an incredible tale!

58
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,900
Gran Gran, you look old. How old are you?
And why is it so cold in the South Pole?

59
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,860
Can we make a campfire,
and all hurdle around it,

60
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,620
and tell scary stories, and make snowmen?

61
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,470
And then can you make the snowmen
move with waterbending and chase us?

62
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,710
Wouldn't that be fuuun? Huh? Wouldn't it?

63
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,450
Pema, let me help you.
Careful now, careful.

64
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,570
Stop doting on me.
I'm not helpless, I'm just pregnant.

65
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,570
The baby's strong.
I see another airbender in your future.

66
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,700
All I want is one child
like me, a nice non-bender,

67
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,360
who doesn't blast wind in
my face every five seconds.

68
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,740
Mommy, look, I am a snowbender!

69
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,710
Were Tenzin and his siblings
this crazy when they were kids?

70
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,490
Kya and Bumi certainly were, but Tenzin
is always been... rather serious.

71
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,330
Mother, please.

72
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:40,060
Korra? Look at you, so big and strong.
You've grown into quite the young Avatar.

73
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,310
Master Tenzin, I'm so glad you're
here, I can't wait to get started.

74
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,280
Yes, well...

75
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,830
You're going to have to
tell her sooner or later.

76
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,810
Tell me what?

77
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,170
You're not staying, are you?

78
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,650
I'm afraid not. We're only visiting for the night.
Then I have to return to Republic City.

79
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,640
But, you're supposed to move here.
You're supposed to teach me.

80
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,910
I'm sorry, Korra. Your airbending
training is going to have to wait.

81
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,370
So, how long until you're ready to
teach me airbending? A week? A month?

82
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,460
It could be much longer.

83
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,420
I don't understand.
Why are you making me wait?

84
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,790
I have a responsibility to Republic City.

85
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,110
I am one of its leaders, and the situation
there is very unstable right now.

86
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,340
But you also have a
responsibility to teach me.

87
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,060
Believe me, I'd be happy to find another
airbending master, but you're the only one.

88
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,850
We're stuck with each other.

89
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,610
I wish there were another way.

90
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:47,000
Wait, there is! If you can't stay here, then
I'll go back to Republic City with you!

91
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,270
It's perfect!

92
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,000
Absolutely not!
The city is far too dangerous.

93
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,990
Avatar Aang tasked us with keeping you
safe while you mastered the four elements.

94
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,860
I get that, but I don't think
keeping me locked up in

95
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,480
this compound like a prisoner
is what he had in mind.

96
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,820
I know this is difficult to accept,

97
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,280
but it's not the right time
for you to come to the city.

98
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:07,960
Whatever.

99
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,980
Goodbye, Gran Gran!

100
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,010
Oogi, yip-yip!

101
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,060
Nice night for an escape, isn't it?

102
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,980
I have to leave.
I have to find my own path as the Avatar.

103
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,600
I know you do.

104
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:06,190
Aang's time has passed.
My brother, and many of my friends are gone.

105
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,930
It's time for you, and your
generation to take over the

106
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,020
responsibility of keeping peace,
and balance in the world.

107
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,710
And I think you're going
to be a great Avatar.

108
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,110
Thank you.

109
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,820
Goodbye, Korra.

110
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,950
Mom, dad...,

111
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,330
I'll miss you.

112
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,160
We love you so much.

113
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,480
Naga, we're here!

114
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,440
Thanks for the ride!

115
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,910
Wow, look at this place.

116
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,050
I've never seen so many Satomobiles!

117
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,990
Air Temple Island.
That's where Tenzin lives.

118
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,830
You ready for a little swim, girl?

119
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,500
Okay, okay! Food first, then air temple!

120
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,050
Watch out, Naga! Look out!

121
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,660
Watch where you're going!

122
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,560
Whoops, sorry about that.
Excuse us. Coming through.

123
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,870
Heads up. Eh, sorry, we're new in town.

124
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,290
Naga, wait.

125
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,660
We'll take one of everything, please.

126
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,300
That will be twenty yuans.

127
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,620
Uh... I don't have any money?

128
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,090
Then what good are you to me?

129
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,620
Don't worry, girl. The city's huge.

130
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,110
I bet we could find a place to
rustle up something to eat.

131
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,010
Uh, say, think I can I get one
of them tasty-smelling fishies?

132
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,770
Oh, uh, yeah, sure.

133
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,970
So, do you... live in that bush?

134
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,870
Yes, presently that is what I do call home.

135
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,270
Took me a while to procure
a bush that beauteous.

136
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,540
This park is quite popular
with all the vagabonds.

137
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:34,230
So there are a lot of you out here?
I thought everyone in this city was "living it up".

138
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,020
Hey, you've got a lot to learn newcomer.
Welcome to Republic City.

139
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,310
Hey you!

140
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,450
Stop! You can't fish here!

141
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,590
You best skedaddle!

142
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,860
Are you tired of living under the tyranny of benders!
Then join the Equalists!

143
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,240
For too long the bending
elite of this city have

144
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,990
forced non-benders to live
as lower class citizens.

145
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,770
Join Amon, and together we will tear
down the bending establishment.

146
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,050
What are you talking about?
Bending is the coolest thing in the world.

147
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,870
Oh yeah? Let me guess: You're a bender.

148
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,130
Yeah, I am.

149
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:29,060
Then I bet you'd just love to knock me off
this platform with some waterbending, huh?

150
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,890
I'm seriously thinking about it.

151
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,800
This is what's wrong with this city!

152
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,520
Benders like this girl only use
their power to oppress us!

153
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,730
Yeah! Get out of here!

154
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:45,350
What? I'm not oppressing anyone! You're...
you're oppressing yourselves!

155
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,610
That didn't even make sense.

156
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,880
Excuse me, I think I'm lost.

157
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,080
How do I get to Air
Temple Island from here?

158
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,240
Just head down this street.

159
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,740
You should get moving, young lady.
It isn't safe.

160
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,740
Mr. Chung, please tell me
that you have my money,

161
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,830
or else I can't guarantee I can
protect your fine establishment.

162
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,430
I'm sorry, business has been slow.
Please, take one of my phonographs.

163
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:29,580
My friend here is not a music lover.
Give me the money, or else...

164
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,390
Or else what, hoodlum?

165
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:45,500
Since you're obviously fresh off the
boat, let me explain a couple things.

166
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,850
You're in Triple Threat Triad territory, and
we're about to put you, in the hospital.

167
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,450
You're the only ones who
are gonna need a hospital,

168
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,210
and, for your sake, I
hope there's one nearby.

169
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,900
Who do you think you are?

170
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,910
Why don't you come and find out?

171
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,200
What just happened?

172
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,520
Did she just earthbend?

173
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,770
Can she firebend too?

174
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,220
Could she be...

175
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,520
Got an idea about who I am now, chumps?

176
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:43,500
Come on!

177
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,800
You're not getting away!

178
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,260
Police! Freeze where you are!

179
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,330
Cool! Metalbenders!

180
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,030
I caught the bad guys for you, officers.

181
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,520
Arrest them!

182
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,540
You're under arrest, too.

183
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,130
What do you mean I'm under arrest?

184
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,350
Those are the bad guys over there!
They were smashing up the shop!

185
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,260
From the looks of it, you smashed
up a lot more than that.

186
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,740
Wait, you can't arrest me! Let me explain!

187
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,230
You can explain all you
like, down at headquarters.

188
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,090
Let's see.

189
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:06,440
Multiple counts of destruction
of private and city property,

190
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,970
not to mention evading arrest...

191
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,890
You're in a whole mess
of trouble, young lady.

192
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,620
But there were some thugs threatening a
helpless shopkeeper, and I had it...

193
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,440
Can it! You should have called the
police and stayed out of the way.

194
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:22,600
But I couldn't just sit by and do nothing.
It's my duty to help people.

195
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,220
See, I'm the Avatar.

196
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,100
Oh, I am well aware of who you are.

197
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,830
And your Avatar title might
impress some people, but not me.

198
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,370
All right, fine. Then I want to
talk to whoever's in charge.

199
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,520
You're talking to her. I am Chief Beifong.

200
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,290
Wait, Beifong? Lin Beifong?
You're Toph's daughter!

201
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,100
What of it?

202
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,480
Well then, why are you
treating me like a criminal?

203
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,420
Avatar Aang and your mother were friends.
They saved the world together.

204
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,920
That's ancient history.

205
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,380
And it's got diddly-squat to do
with the mess you're in right now.

206
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:02,180
You can't just waltz in here and doll out
vigilante justice like you own the place.

207
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,650
Chief, Councilman Tenzin is here.

208
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,600
Let him in.

209
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,350
Tenzin, sorry...

210
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,310
I got a little sidetracked
on my way to see you.

211
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,230
Lin, you are looking radiant as usual.

212
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,930
Cut the garbage, Tenzin.
Why is the Avatar in Republic City?

213
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,420
I thought you were supposed to be moving
down to the South Pole to train her.

214
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,730
My relocation has been delayed.

215
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,370
The Avatar on the other hand
will be heading back to

216
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,780
the South Pole immediately,
where she will stay put.

217
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:39,240
But...

218
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,650
If you would be so kind as to
drop the charges against Korra,

219
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:49,450
I will take full responsibility for today's
regrettable events and cover all the damages.

220
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,320
Fine. Get her out of my city.

221
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,490
Always a pleasure, Lin. Let's go, Korra.

222
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,870
Tenzin, please, don't send me back home.

223
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,750
You blatantly disobeyed my wishes
and the orders of the White Lotus.

224
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:19,660
Katara agreed with me that I should come!
She said my destiny is in Republic City.

225
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,580
Don't bring my mother into this!

226
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,080
Look, I can't wait any longer
to finish my training.

227
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,050
Being cooped up and hidden away from the world
isn't helping me become a better Avatar.

228
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,440
I saw a lot of the city today,
and it's totally out of whack.

229
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:39,600
I understand now why you need to stay.
Republic City does need you. But it needs me, too.

230
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:40,420
You...

231
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,750
Is this your polar bear dog, miss?

232
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,900
Korra!

233
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,810
Are you coming to live
with us on the island?

234
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,990
No, I'm sorry, Ikki. I have to go home.

235
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,620
Wait.

236
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,770
I have done my best to guide
Republic City towards the

237
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,560
dream my father had for
it, but you're right.

238
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,070
It has fallen out of
balance since he passed.

239
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,190
I thought I should put off
your training in order

240
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,650
to uphold his legacy,

241
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,440
but you are his legacy.

242
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,880
You may stay and train
airbending here with me.

243
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,720
Republic City needs its Avatar once again.

244
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,840
Yes! Thank you! You're the best!

245
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,680
Hello? I'm Korra,

246
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,840
I'm Korra, your new Avatar.

247
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,380
Does this mean you've
moved to Republic City?

248
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,900
Were you trying to send a message
to the Triads yesterday?

249
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,580
Will you be fighting crime or the
Anti-bending Revolution, or both?

250
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,890
Will you be working with Chief
Beifong and the police?

251
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:39,150
Uh... yes, I am definitely here to stay, but
honestly I-I don't exactly have a plan yet.

252
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:43,550
See, I'm still in training,
but, look, all I know is

253
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:48,860
Avatar Aang meant for this city to be the
center of peace and balance in the world,

254
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:53,030
and I believe we can
make history a reality.

255
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,780
I look forward to serving you!

256
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,690
I'm so happy to be here.
Thank you, Republic City!

257
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,490
All right, that's all
the questions the Av...

258
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,970
Amon, how do you wanna handle this?

259
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:12,360
So, the Avatar has arrived early.
It looks like we'll have to accelerate our plans.

260
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:35,860
And, in the final round, the Buzzard
Wasps won with a decisive knockout!

261
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,860
What do you say we go to the arena tonight,
catch a few pro-bending matches?

262
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,710
That sport is a mockery of the
noble tradition of bending.

263
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,190
Come on Tenzin!

264
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,650
I've dreamed about seeing a
pro-bending match since I was

265
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,150
a kid and now I'm just a ferry
ride away from the arena.

266
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:54,500
Korra, you're not here to watch that drivel.
You're here to finish your Avatar training.

267
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,670
So for the time being I want
you to remain on the island.

268
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,920
Is that why you're keeping the White Lotus
sentries around to watch my every move?

269
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,590
Yes.

270
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:05,190
In order to learn airbending I
believe you require a calm,

271
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,140
quiet environment - free
from any distractions.

272
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,270
All right, you're the master.

273
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:23,050
So, my mother informed me that you've
never been able to airbend before.

274
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,580
Yeah, but I don't know why.
The other elements came so easily to me.

275
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,800
But every single time I've
tried airbending; Nothing.

276
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,570
That's perfectly alright.
You just need to be patient.

277
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,540
Often the element that's most
difficult for the Avatar to

278
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,770
master is the one most opposite
to the Avatar's personality.

279
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,620
For Aang it was earthbending.

280
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,780
Well I'm about as opposite
an airbender as you can get.

281
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,310
Let's begin your first lesson.

282
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,970
Korra's gonna' airbend!
Korra's gonna' airbend!

283
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,510
What on earth is that contraption?

284
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,380
A time honored tool that teaches the
most fundamental aspect of airbending.

285
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,860
Jinora, would you like to
explain this exercise?

286
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,440
The goal is to weave your
way through the gates and

287
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,530
make it to the other side
without touching them.

288
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,390
Seems easy enough.

289
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:13,460
Jinora forgot to say that you have to get
through while the gates are spinning.

290
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,920
The key is to be like the leaf.

291
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,950
Flow - with the movement of the gates.

292
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,110
Jinora will demonstrate.

293
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,070
Airbending is all about spiral movements.

294
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:43,620
When you meet resistance, you must be able
to switch direction at a moment's notice.

295
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,450
Let's do this!

296
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,950
Don't force your way through!

297
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,880
Dance! Dance like the wind!

298
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,880
Be the leaf...

299
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,050
Airbend!

300
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:35,550
What is wrong with me? Airbend!

301
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,990
Maybe I'm just not cut out to
be an airbender, huh Naga?

302
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,020
Ladies and gentlemen!

303
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:51,080
I'm coming to you live from Republic City's
pro-bending arena - where tonight the best

304
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,440
in the world continue their quest for a spot
in the upcoming championship tournament.

305
00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:00,560
Grab your snacks and grab your kids because
this next match is gonna' be a doozie!

306
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:04,960
This Mako's got moxy!
He advances, fires two quick shots.

307
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,290
Yomo is hammered back to zone three!
The clock is winding down, can Yomo hold on?

308
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,050
He's teetering on the edge of the ring now.
The Fire Ferrets line up to strike!

309
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,920
Korra, come down here please!

310
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,520
You shut it off at the best part!

311
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,890
I thought I made myself clear.
I don't want you listening to this distracting nonsense.

312
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,310
But it's their radio.

313
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:32,150
And technically you said I
couldn't watch a match,

314
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,180
you didn't say anything
about listening to one.

315
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,080
You... You know what I meant!

316
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:40,100
Anyway shouldn't y- Shouldn't
you be in bed by now!

317
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,280
I think I'm doing it wrong.

318
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,850
There's nothing to do.

319
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:06,430
Let your mind and your spirit be free,
for air is the element of freedom.

320
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,900
Is something funny?

321
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:15,220
Yeah, you're telling me to embrace freedom but
you won't even let me listen to the radio.

322
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,680
And forget about leaving this island!

323
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,770
Please, Korra.

324
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,350
Look at Meelo, he's able
to meditate peacefully.

325
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,530
Actually, I think he's asleep.

326
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:31,150
What?! Well, at least he has
the relaxing part down.

327
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,520
Whatever. None of this airbending
stuff makes any sense to me.

328
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:38,290
I know you're frustrated, but these
teachings will sink in over time.

329
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,120
Then one day, they'll just click.

330
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,460
Yeah, it's not sinking in yet.
I'm gonna get a glass of lychee juice.

331
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,520
Korra, the meditation's not over yet!

332
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,530
Daddy, can I have some lychee juice too?

333
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:53,890
No.

334
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:05,250
Hey, what're you doin' in my gym?

335
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,290
Uh, I was just looking for a
bathroom when I got lost.

336
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:11,230
Ah, the old "I had to pee" excuse!

337
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,250
You know, I'm sick and tired of you
kids sneakin' in without payin'!

338
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,770
I'm taking you to security!

339
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:16,680
No, wait!

340
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,740
There you are!
I've been looking everywhere for you!

341
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,750
It's all right Toza, she's with me.

342
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,720
Yeah, I'm with him.

343
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,490
So, you see, we're together.

344
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,750
Well, not together together,
more like friends.

345
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,900
Right, friends.
No, no, I didn't mean to imply.

346
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,780
Oh, you implied it.

347
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,830
Ah, I don't care what you are!
I got work to do.

348
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,020
Ooh, right this way, miss.

349
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,420
Ah, thank you sir!

350
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,370
Seriously, thanks.

351
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,520
Whaddya think?
Best seats in the house, huh?

352
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,150
Wow! Unbelievable!

353
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,600
This place is even more
amazing than I imagined!

354
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,140
Name's Bolin, by the way.

355
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:56,820
Korra.

356
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,180
Bolin.

357
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:00,330
Yeah.

358
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:05,100
I told you. You have to stop bringing your
crazy fangirls in here before the matches.

359
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,380
Get her out of here.

360
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,880
Come on, Mako!

361
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,980
Right, look, I kinda
promised her she could stay,

362
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:15,010
but man, I got a good feeling,
there's somethin' special about her.

363
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,030
I know it!

364
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,000
Come here, I want you to
meet my brother, Mako.

365
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,680
Mako? Wow, I- I heard you
playing on the radio.

366
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,950
Come on, Bolin, we're up.

367
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,750
Or I could meet him later.

368
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,980
Yeah, sorry about that.
My brother just gets real focused before a match.

369
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,180
Okay, I gotta go, wish me luck.

370
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,050
Not... that I'll need it.

371
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,460
Good luck. Knock 'em out!

372
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,880
Introducing the Fire Ferrets!

373
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,530
I love you Bolin.

374
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,280
The rookie Ferrets came from
out of nowhere and have

375
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,780
made it further than anyone
expected this season.

376
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,740
But tonight they face their
toughest test yet folks.

377
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:08,680
And they’re off. The two teams waste no time
trying to blast each other out of zone 1.

378
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,970
Hasook is the first to feel
the heat of the Tigerdilloes,

379
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,180
he tries to return the favor
but they’re too fast for him.

380
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,810
While Mako showcases his
trademark cool under fire style.

381
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:27,580
The Tigerdilloes score with
a walloping one-two combo.

382
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,530
Can the teammate hold on
to their zone 1 territory...

383
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,480
guess not. Mako’s over the line.

384
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,720
The Tigerdilloes get the green line
and advance into Ferret territory.

385
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,340
Come on Ferrets!

386
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:49,720
Look’s like Hasook’s in trouble.
He’s in zone 3 teetering over the drink.

387
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,200
And Hasook takes a dip.
He’ll be back for round two.

388
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,390
Assuming the fabulous bending brothers can
hold their ground until he next round.

389
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:08,130
Round 1 goes to the Golden
Temple Tigerdilloes!

390
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,190
Come on Hasook get your act together!

391
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,890
The Fire Ferrets are knocked into
zone 2 and the Tigerdilloes advance.

392
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:40,010
The Fire Ferrets sinch the round in the
closing seconds. That’s one a piece.

393
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,650
Still anyone’s match as we go
into the third and final round.

394
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,200
Hasook stumbles and now he
tumbles right into his teammate.

395
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,590
He and Bolin better untangle quick
if they don’t want to—Oh too late!

396
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,460
Oh no!

397
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:00,040
It’s all up to Mako now,
he’s bobbing and weaving,

398
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,040
he’s weaving and bobbing
but he’s not hitting back!

399
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,340
If Mako’s knocked out the
Ferrets’ fabulous season is over.

400
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:11,640
He is dancing on the edge of the ring
surviving the three on one barrage.

401
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:14,980
It seems his plan is to let the
Tigerdilloes punch themselves out.

402
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,240
And his plan is working.
Han is in the pool!

403
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,830
They’ve got nothing left in the
tank and Mako is on the offensive!

404
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:28,900
It’s two on one, scratch that it’s one on one.
And it’s an Earth and Fire slugfest!

405
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:34,050
There’s so much smoke and dust from the fire
and I can’t even see where the Fire Ferret is.

406
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,750
It's a knock-out!

407
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,140
What a win they had a hat trick folks!

408
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,290
Mako pulls off the upset of the season
winning the match for the Fire Ferrets!

409
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,090
Woohoo! Yes! One more win and we’re
in the championship tournament!

410
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:05,910
So, what’d ya think Korra?
Bolin’s got some moves huh?

411
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:10,340
What did I think? What did I think?
That was amazing!

412
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,120
You did more harm than good out there.
You almost cost us the match.

413
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,260
We won didn’t we?

414
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:15,920
Barely.

415
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,210
Get off my case pal.

416
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,990
Useless.

417
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:24,750
You guys were incredible out there.
Especially you Mr. Hatrick.

418
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,280
Oh you’re still here…

419
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,590
Oh you’re still a jerk….anyway,

420
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,540
Anyway, I’ve been immersed in bending my whole
life but I never learned to move like that.

421
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,550
It’s like there’s a whole new style here.
Think you could show me a few tricks?

422
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,610
Absolutely!

423
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,340
Right now? Come on Bolin.

424
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,930
Just ignore him.
Yeah I could show you the basics.

425
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:49,630
I’m just not sure how my
Earthbending would translate

426
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,210
to your Waterbending but
we’ll figure it out.

427
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,450
Won’t be a problem, I’m
actually an Earthbender.

428
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,350
I’m sorry! No, no I didn’t mean to assume...
I was just figuring,

429
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:03,670
with your Water Tribe get up
that you are a Water Tribe gal.

430
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,700
No you’re right.
I’m a Waterbender and a Firebender.

431
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,280
I’m very confused right now.

432
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,950
You’re the Avatar and I’m an idiot.

433
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,610
Both are true.

434
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,990
No way… The Avatar!

435
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,460
Alright. Let’s see what you got.

436
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:34,590
That was great! Good power!
But in a real match you’d be a sitting turtleduck.

437
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,420
Not so upright and flatfooted.

438
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,070
Stay light on your toes
right up until the moment

439
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,770
when you need to dig in and strike.
Then...

440
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,670
Okay, let me try it again.

441
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,510
Wow! Nice adjustment.
You’re a natural at this!

442
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,190
Not bad.

443
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,520
What’s it take to impress this guy?

444
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,770
What? I said not bad.

445
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,800
You know what, it’s getting late.
I think I’m gonna turn in. You kids have fun.

446
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,200
Nice to meet you Avatar Korra.

447
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,110
Yeah real pleasure.

448
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,460
See you upstairs bro.

449
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,370
Upstairs? You guys live here?

450
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:20,740
Yeah, in the attic, it’s nothing fancy but
we have great views. But back to bending.

451
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,770
So, back to bending. Why don’t you
throw that combination one more time.

452
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,800
Patience Korra!

453
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:58,120
That was a 2000 year old historical
treasure…what…what is wrong with you?!

454
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,790
There’s nothing wrong with me!
I’ve been practicing just like you taught me!

455
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:06,130
But it isn’t sinking in okay!
It hasn’t clicked like you said it would!

456
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:09,970
Korra this isn’t something you can force.
If you would only listen to me…

457
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,050
I have been!
But you know what I think?

458
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,780
Maybe the problem isn’t me,

459
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:18,150
maybe the reason I haven’t learned Airbending
yet is because you’re a terrible teacher.

460
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,570
Yeah you’re a terrible teacher Daddy!

461
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,670
Okay! Everyone here? Wait…where’s Korra?

462
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,530
Honestly Pema, I am at my wit’s
end with that girl. I...

463
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,270
I don’t know how to get through to her.

464
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:51,860
Dear the best thing you can do right
now is give Korra some space.

465
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:55,250
You must promise me that your
teenage years won’t be like this.

466
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,760
I will make no such promises.

467
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:09,390
I didn’t miss your match did I?
You guys look like you lost already.

468
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,810
We might as well have.

469
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,740
Hasook’s a no good no show.

470
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:17,200
You got two minutes to come out ready
to play or you’re disqualified.

471
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,400
Well there goes our shot at the
tournament and the winnings.

472
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,400
Couldn’t you ask one of
those guys to fill in?

473
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,630
Nah, the rules say you can
only compete on one team.

474
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,480
Well then…how about about me?
I’m a topnotch Waterbender if I do say so myself.

475
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,370
But you’re the Avatar…isn’t that cheating?

476
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,610
It isn’t cheating if I
only do Waterbending.

477
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:40,950
No way. I’d rather forfeit then
look like a fool out there.

478
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:43,270
Wow thanks for the vote of confidence…

479
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,190
Time’s up you in or out?

480
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,670
We’re in.

481
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,070
We are?

482
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:46,400
Yes!

483
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,890
Hey I didn’t agree to this!

484
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,040
You can thank me later.

485
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,110
This girl is crazy…

486
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,010
Look’s like the Fire Ferrets have ferreted
out a last minute replacement Waterbender.

487
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,740
Let’s see if she’s another
diamond in the rough

488
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,990
like the brothers from the
school of hard knocks.

489
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:04,890
Don’t do anything too fancy or aggressive.
In fact, don’t do anything.

490
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,980
Just try not to get knocked off the ring.

491
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,630
You got it captain.

492
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,860
Players are you ready?

493
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,300
Whoo! Man overboard!

494
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:25,230
Fire Ferret Waterbender
penalty, move back one zone.

495
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,920
What? Why?

496
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:31,050
You’re only allowed to knock players off
the back of the ring, not over the sides.

497
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,100
Oh…whoops.

498
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,520
And we’re back in action after that hiccup.

499
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,620
But I’m not so sure this replacement
player knows what she’s doing.

500
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,960
Fowl! Over the line!
Move back to zone three.

501
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,610
Ugh! I’ll show you over the line.

502
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,810
The Platypus Bears take round 1.

503
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,630
The Platypus Bears know a green
player when they see one and

504
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,990
they are focusing the brunt of
their bending on this poor girl.

505
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,690
What a minute, did that
Waterbender just Earthbend?

506
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,240
Fowl!...I think.

507
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,350
Did I see that right?

508
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,380
Hold on folks we’re just waiting
for the Referee’s official call,

509
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,490
but... I think this
replacement player could be…

510
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,170
Pardon me everyone, has anyone
seen Korra this evening.

511
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,350
She’s not in her room.

512
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:32,120
You’ve gotta be kidding me! She’s the Avatar
folks, playing in a Pro-Bending match!

513
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,630
Can you believe that?

514
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,020
I’ll get her myself!

515
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,760
The Avatar will be permitted to continue
so long as she solely bends water.

516
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:50,560
This girl may be the Avatar but
she’s no Pro-Bender and the

517
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,950
Platypus Bears are intent on
exploiting that weakness.

518
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:57,160
They’re giving her their best and
her best is not enough to stop it.

519
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,860
Aaaaaannd... she’s in the drink.

520
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:12,720
Oh hey Tenzin…I thought you didn’t
like coming to these matches.

521
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,800
Once again you have flagrantly
disobeyed my orders.

522
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,070
You were to stay on the island. Let’s go.

523
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,460
No! I’m kind of in the middle of something.

524
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:25,100
I have tried my very best to get
through to you by being gentle

525
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:28,810
and patient but clearly the only
thing you respond to is force.

526
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,800
So I am ordering you to come
back to the temple right now!

527
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:36,280
Why? So I can sit around and meditate
about how bad I am at Airbending?

528
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,910
You know I’m beginning to think there’s a
reason I haven’t been able to learn it,

529
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:42,010
because maybe I don’t even need!

530
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,050
What? That is a Ludacris suggestion!

531
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:48,590
The Avatar needs to learn
Airbending, it is not optional!

532
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:52,400
No, this is what I need to learn!
Modern styles of fighting!

533
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:57,060
Being the Avatar isn’t all about fighting Korra!
When will you learn that?

534
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:58,810
I have a match to go finish.

535
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:06,050
The Platypus Bears win round 2! Round 3!

536
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:14,550
The Platypus Bears come out of the gate
and quickly go after the Ferret brothers.

537
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,080
They’re corralled in the corner,

538
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:21,240
wedged in the edge of zone 1 unable to the
Avatar’s rescue and boy does she need it.

539
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:31,230
Looks like the Avatar’s Pro-Bending
debut is gonna be cut short

540
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:34,980
as she’s pushed back to zone 3 and
the water is calling her name.

541
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:37,280
It’s only a matter of time before...

542
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:40,880
Hold the phone, stop the presses!
She’s still in the game folks!

543
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,120
And she’s moving like an
entirely different player!

544
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,310
Suddenly all of the Platypus Bear
strikes are only striking air.

545
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,870
How about that…

546
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:57,200
The Platypus Bears have no juice left but
Mako and Bolin are still fresh and juicy.

547
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:27,280
Knock-out! The Fire Ferrets come from way
behind and steal the win!

548
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,510
What an upset folks!

549
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:33,260
The rookies, Avatar in tow, have nabbed
a place in the championship tournament!

550
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,020
I cannot believe it!

551
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:38,920
Yeah! Yes!

552
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:44,450
Korra, what can I say?
You really came alive in that last round.

553
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,760
The way you dodged their
attacks…you are a natural.

554
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,330
Thanks but I can’t take all the credit,
someone else taught me those moves.

555
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:04,540
I’m really sorry about everything I said.

556
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:08,380
I was really frustrated with
myself and I took it out on you.

557
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:14,480
I think I owe an apology too. I was trying
to teach you about patience and I lost mine.

558
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,910
No hard feelings?

559
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:19,810
Of course not. By the way you were
really good out there tonight.

560
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,190
You moved just like an Airbender.

561
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,610
Wait... you stayed and watched?

562
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,750
I did. Pro-Bending turned out to be
the perfect teaching tool for you.

563
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,840
I’ll see you tomorrow for Airbending
practice bright and early!

564
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:38,470
And by the way I kinda permanently
joined the Fire Ferrets

565
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,510
and we’re playing in the
tournament in a couple of weeks!

566
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:04,470
