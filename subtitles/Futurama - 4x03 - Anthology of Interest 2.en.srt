00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:09,403  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:490 Y2:516
Anthology of Interest 2

2
00:00:36,093 --> 00:00:39,802  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:061 Y2:127
There. I've finished fine-tuning
my What If Machine.

3
00:00:40,013 --> 00:00:45,406  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:061 Y2:127
It can answer any "What if," accurate
to one-tenth of a plausibility unit.

4
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:47,524  X1:231 X2:484 Y1:061 Y2:088
That's so plausible!

5
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:50,611  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:061 Y2:126
Who wants to see an
alternate reality?

6
00:00:50,813 --> 00:00:54,408  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:061 Y2:126
I want to know what would
happen if I were human.

7
00:00:54,613 --> 00:00:58,447  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:061 Y2:122
Being a robot's great,
but we don't have emotions...

8
00:00:58,693 --> 00:01:01,890  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:061 Y2:126
...and sometimes that makes
me very sad.

9
00:01:02,093 --> 00:01:08,441  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:061 Y2:126
Oh, Lordy Lou, there he goes again!
Well, let's give baby what he wants.

10
00:01:08,813 --> 00:01:12,010  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:495 Y2:516
What if Bender were human?

11
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:20,970  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:061 Y2:122
Good news! I've invented a way
to turn Bender into a human...

12
00:01:21,173 --> 00:01:24,722  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:061 Y2:121
...using the process I call
reverse fossilization.

13
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:26,161  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:495 Y2:516
How does it work?

14
00:01:26,373 --> 00:01:30,446  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:061 Y2:121
In regular fossilization, flesh
and bone turn to minerals.

15
00:01:30,653 --> 00:01:34,328  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:061 Y2:126
Realizing that, it was simple
to reverse the process.

16
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:38,811  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:455 Y2:516
I've already tested it by turning
the toaster into a raccoon.

17
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:43,845  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:490 Y2:516
Kind of gamy.

18
00:01:44,053 --> 00:01:45,122  X1:258 X2:459 Y1:490 Y2:516
Ready, Bender?

19
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:49,605  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:450 Y2:516
I don't know. I'm beginning to
have some second thoughts...

20
00:02:02,653 --> 00:02:04,484  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:490 Y2:516
Cover your shame, mon!

21
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:12,092  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:455 Y2:516
It worked! Eat it, everyone who's
never won a Nobel Prize!

22
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,563  X1:171 X2:543 Y1:490 Y2:516
And that includes you, Amy.

23
00:02:14,773 --> 00:02:20,325  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
So this is a human body, huh? Neat!
Hey! My antenna's gone!

24
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:24,566  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:516
Nah, it just moved. I'm not getting
good reception on it, though.

25
00:02:24,773 --> 00:02:26,764  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:490 Y2:516
Maybe if I wiggle it around...

26
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:29,089  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:489 Y2:516
No! You'll make God cry!

27
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:33,366  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:516
Well, let's see what kind of things
this body can do.

28
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:39,252  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:450 Y2:516
Hey, that's pretty fun!
Being human is great!

29
00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:44,966  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:489 Y2:516
Hooray! It's just like Mardi Gras.

30
00:02:47,613 --> 00:02:50,332  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:456 Y2:516
Come into the bathroom
and look at this!

31
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:52,125  X1:222 X2:492 Y1:494 Y2:516
You won't believe it!

32
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:56,212  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:455 Y2:516
Bender, it's okay to be proud,
but don't be a showoff.

33
00:02:57,493 --> 00:03:00,405  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:451 Y2:516
You look a lot better
than you used to.

34
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,605  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:489 Y2:516
You're not so bad yourself, big boy.

35
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:10,290  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:451 Y2:516
Hey, that felt great!
Nah, it's not working anymore.

36
00:03:10,493 --> 00:03:12,006  X1:234 X2:480 Y1:490 Y2:516
Speak for yourself.

37
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:20,171  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:493 Y2:516
Whoa, this is awesome!

38
00:03:20,373 --> 00:03:24,924  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:456 Y2:516
- You drank and smoked as a robot.
- But now it's bad for me! Woo!

39
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:27,693  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:490 Y2:516
Speaking of which, try these nachos.

40
00:03:32,773 --> 00:03:37,801  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:516
Why didn't anyone tell me
tasting things tasted so good?

41
00:03:41,893 --> 00:03:47,013  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:450 Y2:516
What's going on? That rhythm, it's
doing something to my human butt!

42
00:03:53,373 --> 00:03:56,888  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:451 Y2:516
Bender, part of being human
is having self-control.

43
00:03:57,093 --> 00:04:01,405  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:456 Y2:516
I bet I can eat nachos and go to
the bathroom at the same time!

44
00:04:01,613 --> 00:04:03,092  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:451 Y2:516
- No, Bender!
- Stop him!

45
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:04,612  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Just let me go!
- No!

46
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:07,452  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:451 Y2:516
Come, Bender.
It's time to go home and rest.

47
00:04:07,653 --> 00:04:12,681  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:451 Y2:516
I need you in top shape when I present
you to the Nobel Prize Committee.

48
00:04:12,893 --> 00:04:14,087  X1:308 X2:410 Y1:495 Y2:516
Bender?

49
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:17,412  X1:219 X2:495 Y1:490 Y2:516
Goodbye moderation!

50
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,769  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:456 Y2:516
Is Bender still missing for a week?
Where is he?

51
00:04:48,293 --> 00:04:52,605  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:455 Y2:516
As I've said before,
I used reverse fossilization...

52
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:56,601  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:451 Y2:516
...which is the reverse of
regular, uh, eh...

53
00:04:56,853 --> 00:04:58,127  X1:262 X2:452 Y1:495 Y2:516
We found him!

54
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:03,487  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:451 Y2:516
Ah! Then without further stalling for
time, I present to the Nobel judges...

55
00:05:03,693 --> 00:05:08,209  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:456 Y2:516
...the first robot ever
turned into a human!

56
00:05:15,173 --> 00:05:17,767  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:490 Y2:516
My God! He needs medical attention!

57
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:24,408  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:454 Y2:516
Pulse, 300. Liver, failing.
Cholesterol, 40?

58
00:05:24,653 --> 00:05:27,963  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Well, that's not so bad.
- No, I mean 40 pounds!

59
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:32,612  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:490 Y2:516
This scientific breakthrough...

60
00:05:32,853 --> 00:05:36,368  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:456 Y2:516
...heralds a new dawn in
human-robot relations. Yes.

61
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:40,451  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:490 Y2:516
Come here and give old Bender a kiss.

62
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:47,243  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hey, you like grilled cheese?

63
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:53,046  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:455 Y2:516
And, uh, that's why I believe
I deserve the Nobel Prize.

64
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:56,086  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:456 Y2:516
Not only do you not
deserve a Nobel Prize...

65
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,245  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:451 Y2:516
...for loosing this man-ball
upon the world...

66
00:05:59,453 --> 00:06:03,605  X1:150 X2:570 Y1:451 Y2:516
...but you are hereby kicked out
of the Academy of Science!

67
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:11,522  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:451 Y2:516
Wait! As men of science,
are not your minds open to new ideas?

68
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:18,247  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:451 Y2:516
I say, do not judge me until you have
tried my way of life for yourselves.

69
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:27,246  X1:082 X2:633 Y1:450 Y2:516
Young man, you've opened our minds and
swayed our hearts. Let us therefore...

70
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,842  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:490 Y2:516
Party!

71
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:33,282  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hey, everybody!

72
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:35,406  X1:291 X2:425 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Party!
- Woo-hoo!

73
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:36,808  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:490 Y2:516
Party!

74
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:51,325  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:490 Y2:516
Bender, you were right.

75
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:54,605  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:450 Y2:516
You've lived more in one
week of being human...

76
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:58,004  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:456 Y2:516
...than the rest of us have
in our entire lives.

77
00:06:58,213 --> 00:06:59,248  X1:324 X2:391 Y1:495 Y2:516
Woo!

78
00:06:59,493 --> 00:07:02,644  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:456 Y2:516
And so, to recognize your
achievements...

79
00:07:02,893 --> 00:07:09,287  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:451 Y2:516
...I hereby award you
the Nobel Prize in, uh, Chemistry.

80
00:07:11,053 --> 00:07:13,123  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:490 Y2:516
Care to say a few words?

81
00:07:15,693 --> 00:07:16,682  X1:289 X2:426 Y1:494 Y2:516
He's dead.

82
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:20,045  X1:245 X2:471 Y1:495 Y2:516
When did he die?

83
00:07:20,293 --> 00:07:23,683  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:451 Y2:516
About twelve hours ago
when the party started.

84
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:25,372  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:489 Y2:516
But he just said "Woo!"

85
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:29,202  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:456 Y2:516
No, that was air escaping
from the folds of his fat.

86
00:07:29,413 --> 00:07:30,402  X1:324 X2:391 Y1:495 Y2:516
Woo!

87
00:07:33,213 --> 00:07:39,368  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:451 Y2:516
Good night, sweet prince. You were the
greatest man any of us will ever know.

88
00:07:39,573 --> 00:07:44,203  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:450 Y2:516
Let's get him out of here.
He's starting to smell up the joint.

89
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:46,566  X1:324 X2:391 Y1:495 Y2:516
Woo!

90
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:50,963  X1:284 X2:430 Y1:495 Y2:516
Woo! Woo!

91
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:56,412  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>You watched it. You can 't un-watch it.</i>
<i>Stay tuned for more...</i>

92
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:59,690  X1:232 X2:481 Y1:495 Y2:516
<i>... Tales of Interest.</i>

93
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:09,928  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:061 Y2:126
Who else has a question for the What
If Machine? Scruffy? Katrina? Xanfor?

94
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:13,569  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm good at video games
and bad at everything else.

95
00:08:13,813 --> 00:08:16,247  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:490 Y2:516
I wish life was like a video game.

96
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:18,842  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:490 Y2:516
Can you say that as a question?

97
00:08:19,293 --> 00:08:21,329  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:490 Y2:516
What if that thing I said?

98
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:27,323  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:490 Y2:516
Oh, great machine, we beseech thee.

99
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:31,805  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:451 Y2:516
What if life were more
like a video game?

100
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:45,849  X1:130 X2:583 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Hello, ignorant pigs. Drop your</i>

Wait. I know that monkey!
His name is Donkey!

104
00:08:57,013 --> 00:09:00,164  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:516
Monkeys aren't donkeys.
Quit messing with my head!

105
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:04,491  X1:224 X2:489 Y1:061 Y2:122
I'll just put the old
John Q. Nixon on it.

106
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:10,771  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:061 Y2:123
There. No major crap-ups.
You're on, Mr. Ambassador.

107
00:09:12,893 --> 00:09:14,212  X1:282 X2:435 Y1:495 Y2:516
What the...?

108
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:29,085  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:451 Y2:516
Mama Mia! The cruel meatball of war
has rolled onto our laps...

109
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:31,807  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:451 Y2:516
...and ruined our white pants
of peace!

110
00:09:37,653 --> 00:09:41,328  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:451 Y2:516
Mr. Fry, you know the secrets
of the video game "Chance."

111
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:43,205  X1:196 X2:518 Y1:490 Y2:516
Step into the War Room.

112
00:09:46,893 --> 00:09:49,805  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:455 Y2:516
You're meeting with
General Colin Packman.

113
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:54,006  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:456 Y2:516
What can you tell us
about the Nintendians?

114
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:56,602  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:451 Y2:516
I spent all of ninth grade
studying them...

115
00:09:56,813 --> 00:10:01,204  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
...except the day my eyeballs started
to bleed, and in my opinion...

116
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:05,373  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:490 Y2:516
Quickly! To the escape tunnels.

117
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,245  X1:236 X2:478 Y1:490 Y2:516
This way, damn it!

118
00:10:16,373 --> 00:10:20,048  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:456 Y2:516
Delicious!
Just like stale marshmallows!

119
00:10:20,293 --> 00:10:23,524  X1:269 X2:445 Y1:490 Y2:516
And a cherry!

120
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,372  X1:254 X2:461 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hey, watch out!

121
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:35,806  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Uh-oh!
- Oh, my God! He ate Fry! Fry is dead!

122
00:10:36,013 --> 00:10:39,323  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:489 Y2:516
It's okay! I had another guy!

123
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:57,282  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:490 Y2:516
Invaders, possibly from space!

124
00:10:58,493 --> 00:11:03,248  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:456 Y2:516
People of Earth, I am Lrrr
of the Planet Nintendu 64.

125
00:11:03,453 --> 00:11:07,412  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:451 Y2:516
Tremble in fear at our three
different kinds of ships.

126
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:13,006  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:453 Y2:516
All right. It's Saturday night. I have
no date, a two-liter bottle of Shasta...

127
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:16,689  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:456 Y2:516
...and my all-Rush mix tape.
Let's rock!

128
00:11:28,093 --> 00:11:30,766  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:489 Y2:516
We're losing ships. What should I do?

129
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:34,727  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:456 Y2:516
Increase speed, drop down
and reverse direction!

130
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:40,765  X1:220 X2:494 Y1:450 Y2:516
I've still got a trick
or two up my sleeve.

131
00:11:40,973 --> 00:11:44,363  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:451 Y2:516
Watch as I fire upwards
through our own shield!

132
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:48,242  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:494 Y2:516
He's a madman! A madman!

133
00:11:55,293 --> 00:11:57,932  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:489 Y2:516
It's working! Victory's assured!

134
00:11:58,173 --> 00:12:01,609  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:456 Y2:516
My retirement tomorrow
will be all the sweeter!

135
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:06,012  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:494 Y2:516
I'm hit! So cold.

136
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:09,042  X1:337 X2:379 Y1:495 Y2:516
No!

137
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:12,083  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:490 Y2:516
Amy, tend to the Widow Packman.

138
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:20,013  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:490 Y2:516
Drop down and increase speed!

139
00:12:21,613 --> 00:12:24,207  X1:224 X2:492 Y1:490 Y2:516
One ship is left only!

140
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:27,405  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Come on, Fry! Get it!
- It's moving too fast!

141
00:12:27,653 --> 00:12:32,204  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:451 Y2:516
I could never get the last one!
My brother always got it for me!

142
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:41,089  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:451 Y2:516
Drop down! Reverse direction!
Prepare for landing!

143
00:12:53,053 --> 00:12:54,452  X1:242 X2:472 Y1:495 Y2:516
You are defeated!

144
00:12:54,653 --> 00:13:00,046  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:451 Y2:516
Instead of shooting where I was, you
should have shot where I was going!

145
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:06,611  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:490 Y2:516
All your base are belong to us.

146
00:13:10,613 --> 00:13:14,811  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:451 Y2:516
- What do you monsters want?
- One thing, and one thing only:

147
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:20,810  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:451 Y2:516
Quarters! A million allowances worth
of quarters! No slugs or tokens!

148
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:22,128  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:495 Y2:516
Fork them over!

149
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:27,168  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:451 Y2:516
Forget it, you pixelated pirates!
We need quarters to do our laundry!

150
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,362  X1:295 X2:421 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Yeah!
- Right on!

151
00:13:28,573 --> 00:13:31,849  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:451 Y2:516
But space invaders need
to do laundry, too.

152
00:13:32,093 --> 00:13:36,052  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:451 Y2:516
Look at Donkey Kong.
Have you smelled his loincloth?

153
00:13:36,253 --> 00:13:37,845  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Yes.
- Go away!

154
00:13:38,093 --> 00:13:40,766  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:489 Y2:516
We're not giving you our quarters!

155
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:45,251  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:451 Y2:516
What if we put our laundry in with
yours? Would that be okay?

156
00:13:45,453 --> 00:13:48,047  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:451 Y2:516
- I guess so.
- Okay, that settles that.

157
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:52,172  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:451 Y2:516
But if this cape shrinks,
consider your species extinct!

158
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:57,852  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Bravo! That'll be hard to top!</i>
<i>I pity the next...</i>

159
00:13:58,093 --> 00:14:01,483  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:495 Y2:516
<i>... Tale of Interest!</i>

160
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:10,006  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:061 Y2:127
Well, there's time for
one last question.

161
00:14:10,213 --> 00:14:14,206  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:455 Y2:516
Let's turn to the Who Asked
Machine to see who's next.

162
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:18,402  X1:322 X2:389 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>Amy.</i>

163
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:21,045  X1:270 X2:442 Y1:495 Y2:516
<i>I mean Leela.</i>

164
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:24,808  X1:213 X2:501 Y1:456 Y2:516
As an alien who was
abandoned on Earth...

165
00:14:25,013 --> 00:14:27,527  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:450 Y2:516
...I've never really
belonged anywhere.

166
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,166  X1:301 X2:415 Y1:495 Y2:516
Boo-hoo!

167
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:30,722  X1:333 X2:383 Y1:495 Y2:516
Ow!

168
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:36,610  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:451 Y2:516
So my question is this:
What if I found my true home?

169
00:14:37,573 --> 00:14:38,562  X1:333 X2:383 Y1:495 Y2:516
Ow!

170
00:14:48,693 --> 00:14:49,762  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:495 Y2:516
Where are we?

171
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:09,051  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:450 Y2:516
Nibbler, I don't think we're
in New New York anymore.

172
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:17,448  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:450 Y2:516
Jeez, apparently the phrase "Tone it
down" doesn't exist on this planet.

173
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:24,087  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:451 Y2:516
Oh, no! We hit someone!
Quick, back into the ship! Nice boots.

174
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:25,968  X1:321 X2:393 Y1:495 Y2:516
Yuck!

175
00:15:26,173 --> 00:15:29,722  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:456 Y2:516
Look, everyone!
She killed the Man-Witch of the West!

176
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:34,688  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:451 Y2:516
A witch? That explains how these
boots magically appeared on my feet!

177
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:37,407  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:490 Y2:516
No, you stole them. We saw you!

178
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:40,605  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:455 Y2:516
Well, it's hard to find
shoes that fit me.

179
00:15:40,813 --> 00:15:45,329  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:516
Who are you people? Haven't I seen
you in some copyrighted movie?

180
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:51,881  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>We resemble but are legally distinct</i>
<i>from the Lollypop Guild, the Lollypop...</i>

181
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:02,285  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:456 Y2:516
Greetings!
I'm the Cute Witch of the North!

182
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:05,007  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:490 Y2:516
Can anyone fix my ship so I can go?

183
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:06,692  X1:238 X2:477 Y1:495 Y2:516
Ask the Professor.

184
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:11,364  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:451 Y2:516
He lives in the Emerald Laboratory
down Martin Luther King Boulevard.

185
00:16:11,573 --> 00:16:16,010  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:451 Y2:516
- You mean that Yellow Brick Road?
- The city council re-named it in 1 975.

186
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:19,410  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Those are great shoes!
- Oh, thank you.

187
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:22,207  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:489 Y2:516
Do they come in women's sizes?

188
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:32,892  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:490 Y2:516
Crow, prepare to be scared.

189
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:37,122  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:061 Y2:085
"Then, the car honked its own horn!"

190
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:41,724  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:456 Y2:516
A talking scarecrow. Want to come
with us to see the Professor?

191
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:45,812  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:451 Y2:516
- He might give you a brain.
- Hey! That's not nice to say.

192
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:49,011  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:495 Y2:516
Beer! Beer!

193
00:16:49,213 --> 00:16:50,771  X1:261 X2:455 Y1:490 Y2:516
Whiskey okay?

194
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:58,928  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:456 Y2:516
Are you off to see the Professor?
'Cause I could use a heart.

195
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:03,524  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:451 Y2:516
A human heart. I need to pump
a lot of blood out of my basement.

196
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,048  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:489 Y2:516
And I'm the other guy. Courage.

197
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:09,802  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:456 Y2:516
Not enough of it.
Need some from what's-his-name.

198
00:17:12,453 --> 00:17:14,364  X1:258 X2:457 Y1:495 Y2:516
Damn this DSL!

199
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:21,808  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:490 Y2:516
Fly, my stupids! Fly out and get them!

200
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:25,130  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:516
You promised you'd bake
monkey cake today!

201
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,723  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:489 Y2:516
By "monkey cake," I meant your ass!

202
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:38,003  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:450 Y2:516
We've been skipping for hours.
I need to pull over and take "The Wiz."

203
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,970  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:490 Y2:516
What, do I smell or something?

204
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:49,530  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Why'd you bring us here?
- Why'd I have to take a cab?

205
00:17:49,773 --> 00:17:53,561  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:450 Y2:516
Here's why I brought you,
you twice-baked barf bags!

206
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:59,006  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:516
I've always wanted a daughter to love.
You want to get adopted, you skank?

207
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:05,163  X1:101 X2:613 Y1:451 Y2:516
Live here and be a witch like you?
Yeah. As long as I get to hurt people...

208
00:18:05,373 --> 00:18:07,523  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:490 Y2:516
...and not just dance at the equinox.

209
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:11,931  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Absolutely.
- Oh, Mommy! I found my true home!

210
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:17,603  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:455 Y2:516
- That's great, Leela!
- I've heard worse excuses to drink.

211
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:20,122  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:489 Y2:516
I'm melting! Oh!

212
00:18:20,373 --> 00:18:26,164  X1:091 X2:627 Y1:451 Y2:516
Who would have thought a small amount
of liquid would ever fall on me?

213
00:18:27,693 --> 00:18:31,527  X1:221 X2:494 Y1:451 Y2:516
Well, no point letting
her go to waste.

214
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:41,573  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Yes?
- We're here to see the Professor.

215
00:18:41,773 --> 00:18:46,324  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:454 Y2:516
- No one sees the mighty Professor!
- Who's there, Hermes? Visitors?

216
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:50,612  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:451 Y2:516
- I want to see them!
- It's nobody! Now, sign that will.

217
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:53,964  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:450 Y2:516
- He's not here.
- Oh, for the love of Benji.

218
00:19:00,053 --> 00:19:06,288  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:451 Y2:516
I am the Professor!
Great and, uh, forgetful!

219
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:12,087  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:490 Y2:516
Now, what do you nice kids want?

220
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:17,083  X1:101 X2:615 Y1:451 Y2:516
Nothing! But if you have extra courage,
I'd haul it away for you maybe?

221
00:19:17,293 --> 00:19:21,809  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:451 Y2:516
Oh, blithery poop, my cowardly
lobster! You don't need courage.

222
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:27,326  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:451 Y2:516
After all, who needs courage
when you have a gun?

223
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:31,813  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:490 Y2:516
Now, world. You put your hands up!

224
00:19:32,013 --> 00:19:36,689  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Lad, all you need is a brain.
- Why does everyone keep saying that?

225
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:42,005  X1:185 X2:529 Y1:451 Y2:516
This is a stickup!
Give me the bag, old man!

226
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:47,685  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:456 Y2:516
Here you go, my friend.
5000 Professor Land fun bucks!

227
00:19:49,173 --> 00:19:54,452  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Oh, crap.
- You want to go home, right?

228
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:58,248  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:456 Y2:516
No. Not anymore.
I want to be the new Wicked Witch.

229
00:19:58,453 --> 00:20:02,731  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:451 Y2:516
Nonsense. Click your big honking
boots together three times...

230
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:05,003  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:490 Y2:516
...and wish to go home to Kansas...

231
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:09,445  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:451 Y2:516
...to live with your dirt-farming,
teetotaling aunt and uncle.

232
00:20:09,653 --> 00:20:12,292  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:490 Y2:516
Uh, all right. Here I go.

233
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:19,243  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:455 Y2:516
There's no place like...
I want to be a witch!

234
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:31,085  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:489 Y2:516
Oh, no! Help! What's happening?

235
00:20:31,293 --> 00:20:36,162  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:450 Y2:516
Uh, sorry. I think there's a problem
with your upstairs toilet.

236
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:41,527  X1:296 X2:418 Y1:490 Y2:516
Wake up!

237
00:20:42,693 --> 00:20:45,651  X1:198 X2:516 Y1:451 Y2:516
Are you all right?
You got hit on the head.

238
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:48,208  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:490 Y2:516
I was having a wonderful dream.

239
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:51,684  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:451 Y2:516
Except you were there.
And you. And you.

240
00:20:51,893 --> 00:20:53,770  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:493 Y2:516
Never mind, she came to.

241
00:20:55,293 --> 00:20:58,524  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:061 Y2:126
- Oh, so close.
- There's always next year.

242
00:20:58,733 --> 00:21:02,123  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:489 Y2:516
There's always next year.
