The Dragon Prince...

00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:24,399
I'm not going with you to Xadia.

6
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,776
I have to face my responsibility.

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,446
Now that I'm king, I have to go home.

8
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,865
Maybe I can help the world
better from the throne.

9
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,909
I can do whatever I can to stop the war.

10
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,913
[Rayla] This is it, Callum.

11
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,625
Xadia.

12
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:47,005
Soren, what did Dad ask you to do?

13
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,425
Kill the princes.

This is crazy, Rayla! Everything here
radiates with Primal Energy.

37
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,588
- Yup. That's Xadia.
- Wait.

38
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:41,596
What? You're kidding me.
You are kidding me!

Magic dirt? What?

40
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,811
Save some of that
googly-eyed amazement for later.

41
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,730
We still have a mission.

42
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,941
I'm taking you to my home.

43
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:57,195
The other elves will help us get Zym
to the Dragon Queen as fast as possible.

44
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:02,533
And if we get home by dusk,
I can show you something special.

May I offer His Majesty
a freshly baked jelly tart?

00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,800
Uh, really? It's okay?

56
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,468
Um, sure.

57
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,721
[guard 1] The king requests
a tart of jelly!

00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,972
[baker] Of course.

59
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,890
May I have another?

60
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,518
[guard 1] The king requests
another tart of jelly!

61
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,281
You don't have to repeat everything I say.

62
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,689
[guard 2] The king requests
that you stop repeating!

63
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,772
Uh...

64
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,277
[guard 2] I realized as soon as I said it.

65
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,779
You may have as many tarts
as you care for.

[Bait gulps]

67

Corvus!

00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,466
All packed for your journey to the throne?

69
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,999
[chuckles] Would you like a tart of jelly?

70
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,709
No, thanks.

71
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,878
Don't worry,
we can have as many as we want!

72
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,630
I wasn't worried.

73
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,424
[Bait grunts]

[laughs]

75
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,931
Good morning, King Ezran. [snaps fingers]

76
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,601
[Bait grunts]

77
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,898
High Council meetings
are attended by the council itself

78
00:05:56,981 --> 00:06:00,359
and necessary security, and no others,

79
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,237
unless specifically requested by the king.

80
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:09,744
Oh, well, I'd, uh... I'd like to request
Corvus to come. Specifically.

81
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,538
That checks out.

82
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,529
- Well, what do we do now?
- [Bait grunts]

83
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:48,866
The first order of business is to
review messages received by the kingdom.

84
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,493
Crow Lord?

85
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,372
Crow Lord! [voice echoing]

86
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:03,214
Oh! Sorry, the Crow Lord isn't here.
He's taking a personal day.

87
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,424
And you are?

88
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:09,303
The Crow Master.
It's similar, kind of like his number two.

89
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:13,099
If the Crow Lord were to die,
or to be otherwise incapacitated...

90
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,476
Okay, yes, I think we understand.

91
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,478
Can you please read the king his messages?

92
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:24,110
It's so small.
There can't be too much stuff, right?

93
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,365
[clears throat] You have
417 unread messages.

94
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,543
Your Majesty, if the king so desires,

95
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,379
we could begin
with the messages marked "urgent."

96
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,800
- Uh... I do so desire.
- [Bait grunts]

97
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,719
That checks out.

98
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,806
[upbeat music playing]

99
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,935
[gasps] It plays music!

100
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,441
Yup. It's a melodaisy.

101
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,449
Rayla. You're pushing us to move too fast.

102
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,909
You know, there's a human saying,

103
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,661
"Sometimes you just have to stop
and smell the roses."

104
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,997
- Or listen to them, or whatever.
- [Zym chirps]

105
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,542
Maybe you're right, Callum.

106
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,461
Did you know there's a Xadian flower

107
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,714
with a more fascinating scent
than anything in the human kingdoms?

108
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,967
Go ahead, stop and smell this one.

109
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,136
[sniffs]

110
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,141
- [coughing] Ugh!
- [Rayla laughing]

111
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,726
What was that?

112
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:44,565
[sighs] Some call them flatu-lillies,
toot-lips, peri-stinkles.

113
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,192
They go by many names,

114
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,778
but at the end of the day,
it's a fart flower.

115
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,696
[Zym chirping]

116
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,742
- [plants farting]
- Zym, no!

117
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,620

00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,624
Ugh! It's even worse.

120
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,046
I wish Ez were here to smell this.
[sighs] He'd love it.

[yawns]

[winces] Oh, dear. Um... uh...

123
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,271
What's wrong?

124
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,691
I'm not really comfortable reading
some of these things out loud.

125
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,902
Well, can you summarize?

126
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,241
There have been some bad events.

127
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,661
Maybe we should just wait for the
Crow Lord to return, so he can, uh...

128
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,204
Ugh, give me that.

129
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:51,257
This one also has similar...
[groans] bad events.

130
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,468
Assassins.

131
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,595
What?

132
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,682
There have been attacks in other kingdoms.
Successful attacks.

[all muttering]

134
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,269
King Florian and Queen Fareeda are dead.

[all gasp]

136

King Ahling is gravely injured.

137
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,278
It appears that Xadia is waging war
on all of humanity.

[all muttering]

139
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,327
We are in the middle
of an important discussion!

140
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,331
We've arrested two traitors.
We need the king's judgement immediately.

[birds chirping]

147
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:50,024
- How are we going to get down?
- To go down, we need to go up.

148
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:57,239
Wow. This must be the biggest
tree in the world.

149
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,992
- What do you call it?
- A tree.

150
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,703
Up we go!

151
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,881
[Callum] Uh...

152
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,635
[Ezran] What's going on?

153
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,637
Why are they chained up?

154
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,765
Your Majesty,
they're Lord Viren's children.

155
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:27,436
- So what?
- The high mage is in prison for treason.

156
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,439
We suspect they were involved
in his conspiracy.

157
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,983
No, you've got it all wrong.

158
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,819
When Dad sent us after the princes...

159
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,695
Viren sent you after the princes?

160
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,407
Uh... Uh... "Sent" is a strong word.

161
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,953
My point is, he wanted us
to rescue the princes, not kill them!

162
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,413
- [all gasping]
- "Kill them"?

163
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,498
Who said anything
about killing the princes?

164
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,042
No one. That's what I'm saying.
Or not saying.

165
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,712
Ugh, Soren, help!
Tell them we didn't do anything wrong.

166
00:11:56,465 --> 00:12:00,553
King Ezran, they need to be locked away.
Give the order.

167
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,931
But... I'm not really sure
what they were trying to do.

168
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,475
Ezran, please, we talked about this...

169
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,688
Silence!
My king, you need to make a decision.

170
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,734
Okay, but let them rest while I decide.

171
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,696
Get them some food.

172
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,365
[Claudia sighs] Thank you, Ezran.

173
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,202
This is a mistake. They're too dangerous.

174
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,912
You can't just release them.

175
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:33,461
Fine, fine, keep the chains on.
Until I can make up my mind. I'm sorry.

176
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,759
I'm sorry.

177
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,754
Ugh! How long are they going to keep us
like this?

178
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,881
We're prisoners in our own home.

179
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,425
Well, at least we have bread.

180
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,721
They're still going to give us bread
in the dungeon, right?

181
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:30,017
We're not going to the dungeon, Soren!
We didn't do anything wrong.

182
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,393
Claudia, I told you,

183
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,022
Dad wanted me to kill the princes.
That means we're guilty.

184
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,483
At least I am.

185
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,943
No, you're not.

186
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:44,573
I don't know if you misunderstood,
or mis-remembered, or mis-listened,

187
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,493
but there's no way
Dad would tell you to do that.

188
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,996
It doesn't matter anyway.

189
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,708
Dad's in prison, and everyone's
telling Ezran we're guilty, too.

190
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,335
Ezran thinks for himself.

191
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,255
He'll see through this mess,
and he'll do the right thing.

192
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,216
Why are you stacking the bread like that?

193
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,552
It's a bread sandwich.

194
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,222
[Claudia] Ugh!

195
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,851
[Bait croaks]

196
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,938
[guard] King Ezran, a visitor has arrived.

197
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:20,025
Prince Kasef of Neolandia,
eldest son of King Ahling.

198
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,586
Prince Kasef, I heard about
what happened to your father.

199
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:39,879
I'm so sorry.

200
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,964
Thank you for your condolences.

201
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,175
And the tragedy of your father's loss
breaks my heart.

202
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,012
But the important thing
is that we're here now.

203
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,889
Yes. I'm happy to meet you.

204
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,063
My army stands outside your city gates,
at the ready.

205
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,982
At the ready? What do you mean?

206
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,942
[grunts] Forgive me,

207
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,904
but was it not a week ago
your regent called on us

208
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,780
to unite against the rising Xadian threat?

209
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,742
Uh... I'm not sure.

210
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:13,037
Xadia has attacked the human kingdoms.
All of us.

211
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,122
There must be a proportionate response.

212
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,375
I'm sorry,
but, um, I'm kind of new at this.

213
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,879
I'm not really sure what you mean.
What kind of response?

214
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,422
War.

215
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:27,801
What? No. The people of the human kingdoms
and Xadia want peace.

216
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:33,015
Am I missing something?
Why is the child on the throne now?

217
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,893
Isn't there an adult advisor
I can speak with?

218
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,520
I'm right here. You can speak with me.

219
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:43,484
If you can't take action against Xadia,
you have failed as a king.

220
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,612
And you have failed as a son.

221
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:50,282
Enough! You have a disagreement,
but you are in the court of King Ezran.

222
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,367
[Bait growling]

223
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,702
Who are you to interrupt
a royal discussion?

224
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,623
I'm Corvus. I was specifically requested.

225
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:03,837
[sighs] I'm sure once King Ezran
has had proper council,

226
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,006
he will make the correct choice.

227
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,551
I will remain in Katolis
awaiting your decision.

228
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:17,892
[Zym chirps]

229
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,562
[Callum panting]

230
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,877
[exclaims and gulps]

231
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,094
Get ready. Hold on tight.

232
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:58,934
- Uh, are you sure this is safe?
- As long as you hold on tight.

233
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,478
[yelling]

234
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,822
[Zym chirps]

235
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:30,758
- Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to...
- It's okay. It was a bumpy ride.

236
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,390
[Bait grunting]

237
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,103
May I join you?

238
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,316
Sure. Have a seat.

239
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:53,113
- I noticed you aren't wearing it.
- Wearing what?

240
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:58,035
Ezran, the crown is
a heavy burden to carry.

241
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:04,083
[sighs] There's so much happening.
I don't know what to do.

242
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:13,008
There's no shame if you aren't yet ready.
No one blames you for being a child.

243
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,221
[sighs] I feel like
I'm letting everyone down.

244
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,477
- There may be a way out.
- What?

245
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,605
There are capable people around you

246
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:30,234
who can take up the burden of ruling
for a few years, while you...

247
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,528
just focus on growing up.

248
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,197
You're saying... a regent?

249
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,537
Yes. Someone you trust.
You choose who it is. For a few years.

250
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,623
The crown will be here for you
when you're ready.

251
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,336
Just think about it.

252
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,553
This is so much to handle.

253
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,388
[Bait groans]

254
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,975
So what do you say, Bait? Be my regent?

255
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:06,061
- [Bait grunts]
- I agree. You'd be a tyrant.

256
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,145
[Bait grunts]

257
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,608
We made it just in time.

258
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,030
So, what did you want to show me?

259
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,835
[Rayla] I used to come to this meadow
when I was a kid.

260
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,546
I would spend hours on my own,

261
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,591
exploring and making all kinds
of colorful little friends.

262
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,051
Friends?

263
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,473
What is it?

264
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,226
[squeaks]

265
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,310
[gasps]

266
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,314
[squeaking]

267
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,608
It's an adoraburr.

268
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,110
[adoraburrs squeaking]

269
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,280
They're so cute!

270
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:02,034
Look! They stick together.
I thought you'd like them.

271
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,077
I love them.

272
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,996
[adoraburrs squeaking]

273
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:13,378
[laughs] That's nice.
No, really, that look suits you.

274
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,462
[gasps]

275
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,551
[Rayla gasps]

276
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,262
[Callum laughs] Hey...

277
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,056
Hey, these things come off, right?

278
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,474
[both laughing]

279
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,476
[Zym barks]

00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,322
[Bait groans]

281
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,130
[indistinct chatter]

282
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,341
[door opens]

283
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,847
[sighs]

284
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,331
Have you given thought
to what we discussed?

285
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,043
I have. And I have something to say.

286
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,213
[sighs]

287
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,926
All of you knew King Harrow
as a great king.

288
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,638
He was a leader, a warrior,
and a champion.

289
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,974
But I knew him as my dad,

290
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,437
who loved me and my brother and our mom.

291
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,689
And sometimes told really bad jokes.

292
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,235
I didn't see
everything he had to do as king,

293
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:04,323
but I do know that my dad
had to make very hard decisions.

294
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:08,201
I'm just a kid.
I haven't fought in any battles.

295
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,787
I haven't read many books of wisdom.

296
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,958
I haven't gone through the things
that made my father the king he was.

297
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,377
So, I've decided...

298
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,049
that I don't have to be the king
my father was.

299
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,094
My father made choices
to keep fighting battles

300
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,889
that started hundreds of years
before he was born.

301
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:32,476
To punish enemies for crimes
their parents committed.

302
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,312
I don't want to be that kind of king.

303
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,649
Set them free.

304
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,904
Soren and Claudia will not pay
for the mistakes their father made.

305
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,699
But Your Highness, they are criminals.

306
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,368
Take their chains off!

307
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,245
[chains rattle]

308
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,749
Katolis will not go to war.

309
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,585
I'm sorry about what happened
to your father,

310
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:02,339
and what happened to mine,
but we don't have to avenge them.

311
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:06,468
We don't have to strike back.
We can choose peace.

312
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,136
[all gasping]

313
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,305
[all muttering softly]

314
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,861
King Ezran, I admire your courage.

315
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,365
But peace will require
just as much strength as war.

316
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,243
Are you prepared to defend it?

317
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,326
Yes.

318
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,711
I am.
