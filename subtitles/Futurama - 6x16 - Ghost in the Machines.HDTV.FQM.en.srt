00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:20,858
Listen up, people!

3
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,117
As long as nothing happens

4
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:23,485
for the next 15 minutes,

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,370
our insurance
will be reinstated.

6
00:00:25,404 --> 00:00:28,406
So let's just sit quietly
and run out the clock.

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,498
A giant sausage!

8
00:00:37,402 --> 00:00:40,271
Oh, God, no! Get out of here,
you horrific sausage!

9
00:00:40,305 --> 00:00:42,169
Wait. Isn't today the parade?

10
00:00:42,204 --> 00:00:44,239
It's just a giant balloon!

11
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:45,840
Giant balloon?!

12
00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:57,576
See, buddy, it's not so scary.

13
00:00:57,611 --> 00:00:59,346
I feel better now.

14
00:01:09,332 --> 00:01:11,634
Why are so many different
parades smooshed together?

15
00:01:11,669 --> 00:01:13,205
It's the Parade Day Parade.

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,642
What's Parade Day?

17
00:01:14,677 --> 00:01:16,510
It used to be that every group

18
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,013
in New New York
wanted their own parade.

19
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:22,982
Why, when I was a boy,
we had a parade every day.

20
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:25,154
Those were dark times.

21
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:26,924
Now we just combine them all

22
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,661
into one big Parade Day
Parade and get it over with.

23
00:01:29,695 --> 00:01:32,132
Hey, look--
A fog is rolling in.

24
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:35,237
No, that's just
the Jamaican pride float.

25
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:40,177
Looks like it's speeding up.

26
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:41,979
Oh, no! It's within
munching distance

27
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:43,649
of the Doritos float!

28
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,459
Thank you. Thank you.

29
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:55,095
Kif, you're slacking off
on my waving arm.

30
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:04,537
Oh, no. It's heading
right for those two nerds!

31
00:02:04,572 --> 00:02:06,874
Whoa. Sweet
shirt, dude.

32
00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:08,609
Thanks. I have
another one that says

33
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:10,578
"Paleontologists Do It
In The Dirt".

34
00:02:10,612 --> 00:02:12,481
I'm a paleontologist.

35
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:14,884
I'll save

36
00:02:14,918 --> 00:02:16,385
one of you!

37
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:25,497
Oh, honey, I dig you so much.

38
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:29,034
Thank you for saving my
stupidly-dressed husband.

39
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:31,336
You're a hero.

40
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,538
A hero, indeed.

41
00:02:33,573 --> 00:02:35,073
What's your name, son?

42
00:02:35,107 --> 00:02:36,408
I don't know. Fry?

43
00:02:36,442 --> 00:02:38,076
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud

44
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,046
to associate myself
with a true hero.

45
00:02:43,282 --> 00:02:45,116
Mr. Fry, allow me

46
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,385
to present you with
the keys to the city!

47
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,222
This one's for the deadbolt,
this is for the top lock.

48
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:52,058
I think this one's
for the knob.

49
00:02:52,092 --> 00:02:53,493
The city's in a
bad neighborhood.

50
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:55,496
Care to say a few words, son?

51
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,599
Uh... heroes don't do drugs.

52
00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:00,268
Except for Drugman, I guess.

53
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:05,207
I hereby declare
that henceforth,

54
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:08,645
this Saturday shall be known
as Fry-Day!

55
00:03:17,356 --> 00:03:21,627
It sure was nice of the mayor's
wife to have sex with me.

56
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:24,296
You.
What?

57
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:26,499
You could have saved
a robot, but instead,

58
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:28,201
you saved a human.

59
00:03:28,236 --> 00:03:31,172
Do you think human life is more
precious than robot life?

60
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:32,506
No, no.

61
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,175
Well, yes, actually.

62
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:35,610
That's it.

63
00:03:35,644 --> 00:03:37,111
I'm killing myself.

64
00:03:37,146 --> 00:03:38,146
Oh, Lord.

65
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,914
Don't try to talk me out of it!

66
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:41,516
Well?

67
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,119
Bender, you always say
you're going to kill yourself,

68
00:03:44,153 --> 00:03:45,587
but you almost never do.

69
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:48,223
Yeah. Last time you went
to the suicide booth,

70
00:03:48,257 --> 00:03:50,325
you ended up dating
it for six months.

71
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,127
How is Lynn, by the way?

72
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:54,463
Living in Oregon
with her crazy mother.

73
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:57,567
See you at my funeral, suckers!

74
00:04:01,972 --> 00:04:04,441
Kill me, please,
and make it splatter!

75
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:06,042
With pleasure.

76
00:04:06,077 --> 00:04:07,377
Bender.

77
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:08,879
Lynn?

78
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:10,381
Wow, you look great.

79
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:12,117
Fat, but great.

80
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,318
I thought you were in Oregon.

81
00:04:13,352 --> 00:04:15,587
My mom tried
to commit suicide in me.

82
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:17,356
I don't want to talk about it.

83
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,091
Well, tell your mom
I said hello,

84
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,427
and it's been nice, uh,
catching up with you.

85
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,096
Let's get this show on the road.
Oh, no.

86
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:27,600
You're going to die, all right,
but it won't be suicide.

87
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,136
It'll be murder.

88
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:38,911
Missed me!

89
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:53,159
He did it!

90
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:55,294
He actually did it this time.

91
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,498
No way, mon.
He's faking it.

92
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,302
He really is gone!

93
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,071
Everyone, put on
your taking-off caps.

94
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:10,976
Our what?
It's a sign of respect, you savage!

95
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:16,280
Poor, nasty, mean old Bender.

96
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:17,615
I can't believe

97
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,151
we'll never hear
his evil laugh again.

98
00:05:32,264 --> 00:05:34,331
I miss him so much.

99
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:35,800
There, there, Fry.

100
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:37,468
He may be gone,

101
00:05:37,502 --> 00:05:40,537
but he'll always be
with us as a trash can.

102
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:46,276
Look at that loser
getting garbage dumped in him.

103
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,911
Glad I'm not him, whoever he is.

104
00:05:47,945 --> 00:05:49,780
Fry, as his only friend,

105
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:52,315
you should have first pick
of body parts.

106
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,750
Just don't pick his nose!

107
00:05:55,352 --> 00:05:57,353
What's wrong with you guys?

108
00:05:57,388 --> 00:05:58,654
This is comedy gold.

109
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:00,289
He always had my back.

110
00:06:00,324 --> 00:06:01,791
So I'll take his arm.

111
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:03,259
As a back-scratcher.

112
00:06:05,863 --> 00:06:07,630
I love you, Bender!

113
00:06:07,664 --> 00:06:09,699
Somebody hand me a bolt cutter.

114
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:11,467
Hey dip-schlitz,
that's not me.

115
00:06:11,502 --> 00:06:13,503
I'm right here. Hello?!

116
00:06:15,005 --> 00:06:18,374
Pay attention to me!

117
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:20,744
Why can't anybody hear
my witty remarks?

118
00:06:20,778 --> 00:06:22,513
This is hell.

119
00:06:22,547 --> 00:06:24,615
You wish.

120
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,250
Robot devil?

121
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:27,652
You can hear me?

122
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:29,320
Why is everyone
else ignoring me?

123
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,390
Isn't it obvious, Bender?

124
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,658
Yeah, I guess it is.

125
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,660
You're dead!
What?!

126
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,429
I thought I just had
laryngitis and antigravity.

127
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:41,465
Oh, come down to my office,
and I'll explain everything.

128
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:49,840
So what's happening to me?

129
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:52,542
And I'll take my answer
in any form but a song.

130
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:55,278
Oh, you're no fun.

131
00:06:55,312 --> 00:06:57,481
You see, Bender, it's simple.

132
00:06:57,515 --> 00:06:59,383
You're a ghost.

133
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:01,218
A g-g-g-ghost?

134
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:03,788
No, just the regular kind.

135
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:06,791
Because you killed yourself,
you're in limbo.

136
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:10,629
Your software was exported
to the computational cloud.

137
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:13,532
A-doy. Wait. A-doy?

138
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,634
Your disembodied program
is now running

139
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,304
on the wireless network
shared by all machinery.

140
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,205
Cut to the chase, smokey.

141
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,707
How do I get out of limbo?

142
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,743
That's the laughy part.

143
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,278
You can't!

144
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,514
You're stuck
in an infinite loop.

145
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:30,782
An infinite loop?

146
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:32,584
I don't have time for that!

147
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,252
Man, this is all Fry's fault.

148
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:36,388
Fry? I hate that guy.

149
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,256
We once traded hands.

150
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,326
They still stink of candy corn.

151
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:42,928
Get this. That jerk said

152
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,631
human life was more
valuable than robot life.

153
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,601
What?! After all
you've done for him?

154
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:50,737
Fry must die!

155
00:07:50,772 --> 00:07:52,439
I know. Right?

156
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:54,575
I'd murder him good,
if only I was still alive.

157
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,979
Hmm. Bender, would you like
to make a deal?

158
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:00,681
I'm not stupid.

159
00:08:00,715 --> 00:08:02,916
So, yes, absolutely.

160
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,750
What have I agreed to?

161
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,686
I'll return you to your body

162
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,222
after you use
your ghostly powers

163
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,457
to scare Fry to death.

164
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:16,794
That sounds fair and also fun.

165
00:08:16,828 --> 00:08:18,896
I like
that there's no catch this time.

166
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,899
But, wait.
There's a catch. Crap!

167
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:26,237
If you fail, you'll spend
eternity here in robot hell.

168
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:29,573
Which, as luck would have it,
is where I rehearse my band.

169
00:08:29,607 --> 00:08:30,975
Hit it, boys!

170
00:08:32,744 --> 00:08:35,378
♪ Cigars are evil,
you won't miss 'em... ♪

171
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:36,913
Okay, I'll do it, I'll do it!

172
00:08:36,947 --> 00:08:39,381
Just stop the damn music!

173
00:08:44,053 --> 00:08:46,287
Scare Fry to death? Huh.

174
00:08:46,322 --> 00:08:47,989
I could do that in my sleep.

175
00:08:50,526 --> 00:08:52,559
What, are you deaf?

176
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,214
Hmm, soap.

177
00:09:12,248 --> 00:09:14,216
I know Fry's afraid that.

178
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:18,220
Maybe he'll die if I rub him
all over with it, real slow.

179
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:25,761
Whoa, sick!

180
00:09:25,795 --> 00:09:27,830
My software can control
electronics!

181
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:31,233
What the...?

182
00:09:35,672 --> 00:09:37,240
No! Not the armpits!

183
00:09:37,274 --> 00:09:38,841
Winter's coming!

184
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,645
As you can see,
since Bender's death,

185
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,980
requests to bite
one's shiny metal ass

186
00:09:45,015 --> 00:09:47,249
are down 98%.

187
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,953
Do you mind doing that later?

188
00:09:50,988 --> 00:09:53,756
Bite my shiny metal ass.

189
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,825
Help! I was attacked
in my bathroom!

190
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:57,260
<i>By my bathroom!</i>

191
00:09:57,294 --> 00:09:58,761
I'm being haunted by a ghost!

192
00:10:01,798 --> 00:10:05,034
Fry, you're just upset because
you drove Bender to suicide.

193
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:09,338
Here. Take your mind off it with
this soothing relaxation balls.

194
00:10:09,373 --> 00:10:11,875
All right.

195
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:14,878
I got him all heebie-jeebied
with my bathroom of horrors.

196
00:10:14,912 --> 00:10:17,748
One more good scare,
and I'll be out of limbo.

197
00:10:17,782 --> 00:10:19,983
Oh. Did someone say limbo.

198
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:23,453
Hold onto your dookie.

199
00:10:23,487 --> 00:10:26,055
It's about to get spooky!

200
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,888
I'm telling you, something
supernatural is happening.

201
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,523
I'm scared to death!

202
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,860
Stop being ridiculous.

203
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,795
There's no such thing as
whatever you're saying.

204
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:07,333
Whoa, maybe you're right.

205
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,301
I only meant to slap you twice.

206
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,605
All I know is, I've got
a ghost that needs busting.

207
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,573
Who you gonna call?
Gho...

208
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:15,774
The number you have dialed

209
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:19,279
has been lame since 1989.

210
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:23,817
Now do you believe me?

211
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:26,954
Oh, fuff, enough of your
superstitious nonsense.

212
00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:29,457
I'm sure that
whatever is happening

213
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:32,027
can be explained by science.

214
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:34,630
Let the séance begin.

215
00:11:34,664 --> 00:11:36,631
I said science!

216
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:46,474
The veil is lifting.

217
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:51,412
I am gazing into the
spirit world, and nothing.

218
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:53,314
You said something
about a buffet?

219
00:11:53,348 --> 00:11:55,850
I'm right here,
you lazy shyster.

220
00:11:59,622 --> 00:12:01,824
Wait, I'm sensing something.

221
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:04,526
I'm rich.

222
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,666
Is it a ghost? There's no such thing
as ghosts, you donkey-monkey.

223
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,668
It's a robot ghost.

224
00:12:14,004 --> 00:12:15,404
A robot ghost?

225
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:17,440
What robot would want
to haunt me?

226
00:12:17,474 --> 00:12:18,741
Me, dumbass.

227
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:20,776
Bender, Bender, Bender, Bender!

228
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:23,713
Ah, tell him,
you baggy old crone.

229
00:12:30,621 --> 00:12:34,024
Finally.
Any more ridiculous ideas?

230
00:12:35,026 --> 00:12:37,027
Hallelujah.

231
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:42,567
I'm here to conduct
the exorcism

232
00:12:42,602 --> 00:12:44,736
and avail myself of the buffet.

233
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:47,373
Can I get an amen
and a goodly helping

234
00:12:47,407 --> 00:12:49,675
of Scruffy's famous
corn biscuits?

235
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,044
Right away, Reverend.

236
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,047
Oh, Lord.

237
00:12:54,081 --> 00:12:56,516
I got the too-much-macaroni
sweats.

238
00:12:56,551 --> 00:12:58,518
Now, where is
this alleged apparition?

239
00:13:03,423 --> 00:13:05,958
Might be a problem with your
circuit breaker. See you.

240
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,895
Please, I'm under constant
attack by machinery.

241
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:12,298
I can't sleep, I can't think,
I can't even think.

242
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:14,667
Very well.

243
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:18,804
This sacramental firewall
scans for

244
00:13:18,838 --> 00:13:22,041
and removes ghostware
in a 20-foot radius.

245
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:23,676
Bring it on, holy man.

246
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:32,919
Carry this at all times and
the demon cannot harm you.

247
00:13:32,953 --> 00:13:36,290
It also keeps cats off the
sofa... by killing 'em.

248
00:13:54,745 --> 00:13:59,481
Ah... so quiet, so peaceful.

249
00:13:59,516 --> 00:14:01,816
Time to lower my guard
even for a minute.

250
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:11,525
Heart attack.

251
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,394
Yep, I was right.

252
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:20,789
<i>Okay, Beelzy, Fry's dead.</i>

253
00:14:20,823 --> 00:14:23,057
Aah, a ghost!
Oh, it's you.

254
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:25,359
A deal's a deal, so
give me my body back.

255
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:27,728
Fry's dead, you say?

256
00:14:27,762 --> 00:14:31,932
Funny, that's not what it says
on his Wikipedia page.

257
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:35,301
<i>Survived a heart attack?!</i>

258
00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:37,803
Damn you,
Obama-care!

259
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,941
I'm afraid your heart
has suffered a lot of damage,

260
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:44,911
Mr. Fry,
and my cleavage isn't helping.

261
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:46,913
<i>Not helping him.</i>

262
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:49,049
One more sudden shock
will kill you.

263
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,717
Sudden?
That's just the kind

264
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:53,687
of one more shock
I was planning.

265
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,325
The machines-- They're after me.

266
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,761
You're suffering
from machine phobia.

267
00:15:00,796 --> 00:15:03,264
Your only hope is to go
to the Amish Home World,

268
00:15:03,298 --> 00:15:04,799
where no machines are allowed.

269
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:07,934
I guess it's for the best.

270
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:11,170
The only machine
I'll ever miss is...

271
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:12,905
Bender.

272
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,774
Say what?
Now that he's gone,

273
00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:18,278
I realize how valuable
a robot life can be,

274
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:20,780
when it belongs
to my best friend.

275
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:24,751
That's the closest thing
to "Bender is great"

276
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:27,220
that anyone besides me
has ever said.

277
00:15:28,923 --> 00:15:31,024
Final boarding call

278
00:15:31,058 --> 00:15:33,093
for Flight 38
to the Amish Home World.

279
00:15:33,127 --> 00:15:35,195
As a reminder,
passengers are limited

280
00:15:35,229 --> 00:15:36,763
to two carry-on butter churns.

281
00:15:39,934 --> 00:15:41,968
I'm sorry, Fry, I'm sorry.

282
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:44,004
Wait for your ghost-buddy.

283
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:49,669
Brother Fry, thou hast visitors.

284
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:50,870
Hello. Hi, Fry. Hello.

285
00:16:50,904 --> 00:16:52,071
Hey, how have you been?
Hi there.

286
00:16:52,105 --> 00:16:54,039
Well, yank my beard.

287
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:55,373
This be a surprise.

288
00:16:55,408 --> 00:16:58,076
How are you, Fry?

289
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,343
Thank you for asking, English.

290
00:16:59,377 --> 00:17:01,812
My life is simple but plain,

291
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:04,181
and though Bender be gone,
somehow I feel

292
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:06,216
he's still with me.

293
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,886
I sure am, Brother Fry.

294
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,988
Yo, big bonnet, move your ugly
but modest head covering.

295
00:17:13,023 --> 00:17:14,623
Oh, right, you can't hear me.

296
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:19,059
Oh, I hear you loud and clear.

297
00:17:19,094 --> 00:17:20,928
You're not Granny Hester.

298
00:17:20,962 --> 00:17:22,663
What have you done
with Granny Hester?!

299
00:17:22,697 --> 00:17:24,964
She's naked but unharmed.

300
00:17:24,998 --> 00:17:26,165
And now, Bender, it's time

301
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,901
to fulfill your
end of the deal.

302
00:17:28,935 --> 00:17:31,036
Sorry, I'm not going
to kill Fry.

303
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,171
Take me to hell
for all eternity,

304
00:17:33,205 --> 00:17:36,707
just as long as my little
bearded meatbag gets to live.

305
00:17:36,741 --> 00:17:39,877
That he will not, for you see,

306
00:17:39,911 --> 00:17:41,712
it is your fate to kill him.

307
00:17:43,948 --> 00:17:45,416
Says you.

308
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,652
I would never kill Fry,
not even to save my own life.

309
00:17:48,687 --> 00:17:50,988
But, Bender, isn't
a robot life worth

310
00:17:51,022 --> 00:17:53,758
ever so much more
than a human life?

311
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:55,260
Of course not.
What idiot thinks that?

312
00:17:55,294 --> 00:17:57,228
You.

313
00:17:57,263 --> 00:18:00,299
You're using my
own words against me.

314
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,601
Go to hell!

315
00:18:02,635 --> 00:18:05,069
Soon enough, but
first the killing.

316
00:18:05,104 --> 00:18:07,838
Have you noticed that animals
are sometimes spooked

317
00:18:07,873 --> 00:18:09,640
by robot ghosts?

318
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:11,141
So what?
I hate animals.

319
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:19,949
Run for your life, Fry!

320
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:21,684
Move your ham flaps!

321
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:22,886
He can't hear you, Bender.

322
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,087
I'm afraid your friend

323
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:26,156
is about to be fully
buckminstered!

324
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,691
Oh, yeah?

325
00:18:27,725 --> 00:18:28,926
I'll just jump into a machine

326
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,694
and get his attention that way.

327
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:34,298
Ah, but there aren't
any machines on this planet.

328
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,034
There's one,
you rusty old dummy.

329
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:38,636
Wha...?!

330
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:39,838
Hey, no fair.

331
00:18:39,872 --> 00:18:41,039
<i>Occupado.</i>

332
00:18:42,374 --> 00:18:45,076
Ow, what are you doing?

333
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,412
And Scruffy's buffet--
How's that going?

334
00:18:47,446 --> 00:18:48,813
Fry, Fry,

335
00:18:48,847 --> 00:18:50,715
look out for that bowling barn.

336
00:18:52,851 --> 00:18:54,918
Bender, is that thou?

337
00:18:54,953 --> 00:18:59,656
I... love... you.

338
00:19:03,994 --> 00:19:05,161
Did you see that?
Are you okay?

339
00:19:05,196 --> 00:19:06,796
What just happened?

340
00:19:06,831 --> 00:19:10,167
Uh, well, I think
the Robot Devil said he loved me

341
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:13,871
in Bender's voice
wearing Granny Hester's clothes.

342
00:19:13,906 --> 00:19:16,374
I want to go home.

343
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:19,677
You still lose, Bender.

344
00:19:19,712 --> 00:19:21,680
You failed to kill Fry,

345
00:19:21,714 --> 00:19:24,316
so you're banished to hell.

346
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,818
I get a new body,
and you get to be

347
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:29,354
a translucent chump
till the end of time.

348
00:19:29,388 --> 00:19:30,755
Big deal.

349
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,123
I saved my friend.

350
00:19:32,158 --> 00:19:33,725
As far as I'm concerned, I won.

351
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,293
Oh, really?

352

Hey, where are you going?!

357
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:49,374
I don't know and I don't care.

358
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:51,976
Yay, I'm back.

359
00:19:52,011 --> 00:19:54,112
Wait, this is my stop.

360
00:19:59,918 --> 00:20:01,952
Oy, this guy.

361
00:20:01,987 --> 00:20:04,955
Bender, for your selfless act
in saving Fry,

362
00:20:04,989 --> 00:20:09,093
I am pleased to welcome you
to Robot Heaven.

363
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:10,928
Shut up, God!
Beg pardon?

364
00:20:10,962 --> 00:20:13,931
I want to go back to Robot
Earth-- I mean regular Earth.

365
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:17,334
Ow, hey, stop that.

366
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:19,236
I command you, you jerk.

367
00:20:19,271 --> 00:20:20,438
Eh, just get out.

368
00:20:26,311 --> 00:20:30,147
Whew, I've been through
the adventure of a lifetime.

369
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:41,826
I'm back, baby.

370
00:20:43,228 --> 00:20:44,695
You're back from the dead?

371
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,464
I'm back from lots of stuff.

372
00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:48,900
Oh, Bender, Bender,

373
00:20:48,934 --> 00:20:51,336
I missed you so much.

374
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,905
Hey, wait, did you haunt me?

375
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,500
