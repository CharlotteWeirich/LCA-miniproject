1
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:28,735
Zuko: No one can make tea like Uncle.
But hopefully I learned a thing or two.

2
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,881
Would you like to hear Uncle's favorite tea joke?

3
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:32,454
- Katara: Sure.
- Aang: I like jokes.

4
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,540
Toph:
Bring it.

5
00:01:34,735 --> 00:01:38,335
Zuko: Okay. Well, I can't remember
how it starts but the punch line is...

6
00:01:38,408 --> 00:01:41,208
"Leaf me alone, I'm bushed"

7
00:01:45,744 --> 00:01:48,344
Well, it's funnier when Uncle tells it.

8
00:01:48,377 --> 00:01:52,177
Right. Maybe that's because
he remembers the whole thing.

9
00:01:58,205 --> 00:02:02,005
It's nice to get a chance to relax a little.
It hardly ever happens.

10
00:02:07,822 --> 00:02:09,822
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

11
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,510
So what's up?

12
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,240
Sokka: If someone was captured by the Fire Nation,
where would they be taken?

13
00:02:21,737 --> 00:02:23,937
Zuko: What do you mean?
Who was captured?

14
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,400
When the invasion plan failed,
some of our troops were taken.

15
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:29,501
I just want to know where they might be.

16
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:30,881
I can't tell you.

17
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:36,264
- What? Why not?
- Trust me. Knowing would just make you feel worse.

18
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:41,775
It's my Dad. He was captured too,
I need to know what I put him through.

19
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:44,318
- It's not good Sokka.
- Please.

20
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:48,559
My guess is…
They were taken to the Boiling Rock.

21
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,020
- What's that?
- The highest security prison in the Fire Nation.

22
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:57,548
It's on an island in the middle of a boiling lake.
It's inescapable.

23
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,999
- So where is this place?
- Why do you need to know? What are you planning?

24
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:06,083
Nothing.
Boy, you're so paranoid.

25
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,510
It's in the middle of a volcano
between here and the Fire Nation.

26
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,460
You guys actually flew
right past it on your way here.

27
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:18,191
Thanks Zuko.
Just knowing makes me feel better.

28
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:21,021
Yeah, I'm sure it does.

29
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:48,759
Not up to anything, huh?

30
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:55,284
Fine, you caught me.
I'm gonna rescue my Dad. You happy now?

31
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:57,271
I'm never happy.

32
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,500
Look, I have to do this.
The invasion plan was my idea.

33
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,599
It was my decision to stay
when things were going wrong.

34
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,800
It's my mistake
and it's my job to fix it.

35
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:11,108
I have to regain my honor.
You can't stop me Zuko.

36
00:04:12,742 --> 00:04:17,642
You need to regain your honor?
Believe me, I get it. I'm going with you.

37
00:04:17,788 --> 00:04:20,288
No.
I have to do this alone.

38
00:04:20,535 --> 00:04:24,335
How are you going to get there?
On Appa? Last time I checked...

39
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:26,372
...prisons don't have bison day cares.

40
00:04:29,447 --> 00:04:31,047
We'll take my war balloon.

41
00:04:46,673 --> 00:04:49,973
- What does it say?
- Need meat. Gone fishing.

42
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:54,123
Back in a few days. Sokka and Zuko.
One more thing...

43
00:04:54,248 --> 00:04:56,748
Aang,
practice your firebending while I'm gone.

44
00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:01,849
Do 20 sets of fire fists and 10 hot squats
every time you hear a badger frog croak. Zuko.

45
00:05:05,844 --> 00:05:07,844
Nobody else has homework.

46
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:14,558
1 hot squat. 2 hot squat.
3 hot squat. 4 hot...

47
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:31,738
- Pretty clouds.
- Yeah, fluffy.

48
00:05:36,684 --> 00:05:40,684
- What?
- What? Oh, I didn't say anything.

49
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:44,872
You know, a friend of mine
actually designed these war balloons.

50
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:49,009
- No kidding.
- Yep. A balloon. But for War.

51
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:52,215
There's one thing my Dad's good at,
it's War.

52
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,070
Yeah,
it seems to run in the family.

53
00:05:55,102 --> 00:05:57,702
Hey, hold on.
Not everyone in my family is like that.

54
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:59,779
I know, I know,
you've changed.

55
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:05,026
I meant my Uncle.
He was more of a Father to me.

56
00:06:05,742 --> 00:06:07,242
And I really let him down.

57
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:13,359
I think your Uncle would be proud of you.
Leaving your home to come help us, that's hard.

58
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,507
It wasn't that hard.

59
00:06:15,565 --> 00:06:18,965
Really? You didn't leave behind
anyone you cared about?

60
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:22,124
Well I did have a girlfriend.
Mai.

61
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:26,137
- That gloomy girl who sighs a lot?
- Yeah.

62
00:06:27,298 --> 00:06:32,298
Everyone in the Fire Nation thinks I'm a traitor.
I couldn't drag her into it.

63
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:38,644
- My first girlfriend turned into the Moon.
- That's rough buddy.

64
00:06:51,864 --> 00:06:53,564
There it is.

65
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,270
There's plenty of steam to keep us covered.

66
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:00,279
As long as we're quiet we should be able
to navigate through it without being caught.

67
00:07:19,508 --> 00:07:22,508
We're going down.
The balloon's not working anymore!

68
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,940
The air outside is just
as hot as the air inside so we can't fly.

69
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
- So what are we supposed to do?
- I don't know. Crash landing?

70
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:52,918
How are we gonna get off
the island if the balloon won't work?

71
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,350
We'll figure something out.
I suspected it might be a one-way ticket.

72
00:07:56,423 --> 00:07:59,223
You knew this would happen
and you wanted to come anyway?

73
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:02,478
My Dad might be here.
I had to come and see.

74
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:08,883
Uncle always said I never thought
things through but this, ugh, this is just crazy.

75
00:08:09,092 --> 00:08:14,892
Hey! I never wanted you to come along in the first place.
And for the record, I always think things through.

76
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:19,911
But my plans haven't exactly worked,
so this time I'm playing it by ear. So there.

77
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,750
- What are you doing?
- It doesn't work anyway.

78
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,357
- And we don't want anyone to find it.
- I hope you know what you're doing.

79
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,554
Zuko:
There's no turning back now.

80
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:47,327
Zuko:
I hope these disguises work.

81
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:50,847
Sokka: We just need to lay low
and find my Dad as soon as possible.

82
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,880
Guards!
There's a scuffle in the yard, come on.

83
00:09:04,037 --> 00:09:07,537
Chit Sang: I didn't do anything.
I'm going back to my cell.

84
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:11,642
Bully Guard:
Stop right there Chit Sang.

85
00:09:13,158 --> 00:09:15,258
Sokka: We can't blow our cover.

86
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:19,788
Bully Guard:
I've had it with your unruly behavior.

87
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:21,042
What did I do?

88
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:24,642
He wants to know what he did.
Isn't that cute?

89
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,270
Zuko: Uh, yeah, very cute sir.
Sokka: Super cute.

90
00:09:31,627 --> 00:09:34,627
You didn't bow down
when I walked by Chit Sang.

91
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,240
What?
That's not a prison rule.

92
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,360
- Do it.
- Make me.

93
00:09:55,571 --> 00:10:01,071
Tsk, tsk. Firebending is prohibited.
You're going in the Cooler.

94
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:04,683
You!
Help me take him in.

95
00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:07,465
Sokka:
Meet back here in an hour.

96
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:20,739
Bully Guard:
The Warden will deal with you soon.

97
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,126
Bully Guard:
Can you believe this guy?

98
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:31,407
Sokka: Prisoners. Am I right?
Bully Guard: Ugh. Tell me about it.

99
00:10:35,756 --> 00:10:41,756
Male Guard: Hey new guy. I know it's the rule to have
your helmet on at all times but this is the lounge. Relax.

100
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:47,042
Zuko: But what if there's an incident?
If I'm not prepared someone could strike me on the head.

101
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:54,348
Female Guard:
Give it a week, he'll loosen up.

102
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:58,309
Can the new guy ask you
veterans a few questions about the prison?

103
00:10:58,372 --> 00:11:01,372
No,
you can't date the female guards.

104
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:04,476
Trust me, you don't want to.

105
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:12,450
No, that's not it. The Boiling Rock, it holds
the Fire Nation's most dangerous criminals right?

106
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:15,237
So what about war prisoners?

107
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:37,909
It sure looks cold in there.

108
00:11:37,934 --> 00:11:42,934
That's why we call it the Cooler.
He won't be firebending in there.

109
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,420
It's the Warden. Look alive.

110
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:56,144
Warden: So Chit Sang, I hear you used
firebending to try to escape. You should know better.

111
00:11:56,373 --> 00:11:58,873
I wasn't trying to escape.

112
00:11:58,938 --> 00:12:01,438
Bully Guard: He's lying.
I saw him with my own eyes.

113
00:12:02,173 --> 00:12:10,073
No one has ever, ever escaped from here. I'd sooner
jump in the boiling lake myself than let that record fall.

114
00:12:10,118 --> 00:12:13,618
Don't forget it.
Now go back to your shivering.

115
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:27,647
Zuko: Hey there, fellow guard. How goes it?
Sokka: Zuko?

116
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:34,946
Zuko: Shh. Listen, I asked around the lounge. There are no
Water Tribe prisoners. I'm afraid your Father's not here.

117
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:40,137
- What? Are you sure? Did you double check?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

118
00:12:40,338 --> 00:12:42,338
No. No!

119
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:49,638
- I'm really sorry Sokka.
- So we came all this way for nothing. I failed. Again.

120
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:52,161
Err, what would Uncle say?

121
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,920
Sometimes clouds have two sides,
a dark and light. And a silver lining in between.

122
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:07,441
It's like a silver sandwich. So...  when life
seems hard... take a bite out of the silver sandwich.

123
00:13:09,468 --> 00:13:11,568
Maybe we haven't failed after all.

124
00:13:11,596 --> 00:13:16,296
That's the spirit. I can't believe that worked.
I didn't even know what I was saying.

125
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:21,097
No, what you said made no sense at all.
But look, it's Suki!

126
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,610
Guard:
Prisoners! Back in your cells!

127
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:43,039
What is it?
Did I do something wrong?

128
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:46,802
- You mean you don't recognize me?
- You people all look the same to me.

129
00:13:46,878 --> 00:13:49,378
Oh.
Then maybe you'll recognize this.

130
00:13:54,627 --> 00:13:56,927
Sokka, it's you.

131
00:14:01,126 --> 00:14:03,426
The other Kyoshi Warriors,
are they here?

132
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,720
No, I don't know where they are.
They locked me here because I'm the leader.

133
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,000
Well, you won't be here for long,
I'm busting you out.

134
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,560
I'm so glad to see you Sokka.
I knew you'd come.

135
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,940
Female Guard:
‘Scuse me, I need to get into that cell.

136
00:14:27,058 --> 00:14:28,558
No,
you can't go in there.

137
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,911
The lights are out… the prisoner
could sneak up on you.

138
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:37,607
Step aside, fool.
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

139
00:14:47,448 --> 00:14:51,948
Guard, help! I think he's an imposter!
Argh! Arrest him!

140
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:01,359
Get him off me and arrest him!

141
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:11,691
You're under arrest!
Don't worry, I'll figure it out.

142
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:27,324
Warden: Well, well, well.
I never thought I'd find you in here, Prince Zuko.

143
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:29,792
How did you know who I am?

144
00:15:29,851 --> 00:15:33,851
How could I not?
You broke my niece's heart.

145
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:38,278
You're Mai's uncle?
I never meant to hurt her.

146
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:42,683
Quiet!
You're my special prisoner now.

147
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,639
And you best behave.
If these criminals found out who you are...

148
00:15:47,762 --> 00:15:53,762
the traitor prince who let his nation down.
Why, they'd tear you to shreds.

149
00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:58,304
So what's in it for you? Why don't you
just tell my Father and collect the reward.

150
00:15:58,361 --> 00:16:02,861
Oh in due time believe me,
I intend to collect.

151
00:16:13,777 --> 00:16:17,977
- Oh, good. You guys have met.
- A…actually, we met a long time ago.

152
00:16:18,037 --> 00:16:23,037
- We did?
- Yeah, you kind of burned down my village.

153
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:27,106
Oh. Sorry about that.
Nice to see you again.

154
00:16:31,593 --> 00:16:34,093
So listen,
I think I have an escape plan.

155
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:39,648
I checked out the Coolers again, the whole
point of them is to keep firebenders contained, right?

156
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:40,793
Yeah...

157
00:16:40,856 --> 00:16:44,756
So they're completely
insulated and sealed to keep the cold in.

158
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,950
Well to keep the cold in it also
has to keep the heat out, right?

159
00:16:49,022 --> 00:16:50,522
Just get to the point Sokka.

160
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,543
It's a perfect boat
for getting through the boiling water.

161
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,981
The cooler as a boat?
Are you sure?

162
00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:00,069
I'm telling you, it'll work.

163
00:17:02,161 --> 00:17:06,361
I walked around the perimeter.
There's a blind spot between two guard towers.

164
00:17:06,517 --> 00:17:12,117
It's the perfect launching point.
I already tested it out.

165
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,556
We'll roll the cooler into the
water and just float with the current.

166
00:17:15,646 --> 00:17:20,046
It'll take us straight across. As long
as we don't make a sound, no one will notice.

167
00:17:20,135 --> 00:17:22,335
And bing, bang, boom
we're home free.

168
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,809
But how are you going
to get the cooler out?

169
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:27,859
Chit Sang: Yeah,
how are you going to get the cooler out?

170
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,870
What?
We didn't. We… We didn't say that.

171
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:34,333
Yeah,
you heard wrong.

172
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,810
I heard you hatching
an escape plan and I want in.

173
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:39,317
There's nothing to get in on.

174
00:17:39,707 --> 00:17:43,507
Yeah,
the only thing we're hatching is... an egg?

175
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:49,941
Ok, well, I come with you or the Warden
hears about this egg too.

176
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:51,667
I guess we have no choice.

177
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:54,101
Okay, you're in.

178
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:58,653
Now, first we need someone
to unbolt the Cooler. From the inside.

179
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:01,419
Oh,
I can get you inside.

180
00:18:08,098 --> 00:18:13,098
Ugh. Hey, what are you, stupid?
Watch where you're going!

181
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,125
Hey,
you watch who you're shoving.

182
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,960
I think you mean
whom I'm shoving.

183
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,830
Sokka:
I need backup over here.

184
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:42,766
Guard:
No firebending. Into the cooler.

185
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:06,609
Sokka: I can take you back to your
cell if you've learned your lesson.

186
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,166
Yes, I have.
Completely.

187
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,330
I got Suki and Chit Sang out
of their cells a few minutes ago.

188
00:19:17,352 --> 00:19:19,152
They'll be waiting for us at the shore.

189
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:21,329
Someone's coming.

190
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:24,726
Male Guard: Yeah,
new arrivals coming in at dawn.

191
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:26,251
Female Guard:
Anybody interesting?

192
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,640
Nah, just the usual. Some robbers,
couple of traitors, some war prisoners.

193
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,911
Though I did hear
there might be a pirate.

194
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:34,975
Female Guard:
No foolin’.

195
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:38,045
War prisoners.
It could be your Father.

196
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:42,467
- I know.
- Well, what should we do?

197
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:45,217
Are we going ahead with the
plan or are we waiting another night?

198
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:49,229
I don't know.
Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom?

199
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:52,834
All of our freedom on the slim
chance that my dad is gonna show up?

200
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:54,224
It's your call Sokka.

201
00:20:04,948 --> 00:20:06,748
Took you guys long enough.

202
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,805
This here's my girl and my best buddy.
They're coming too.

203
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,754
Fine, everybody in the cooler.
Let's go.

204
00:20:21,573 --> 00:20:23,073
Are you sure you want to go?

205
00:20:23,074 --> 00:20:25,174
You're the one who said
you wanted to redeem yourself.

206
00:20:25,246 --> 00:20:28,746
Redeem your honor.
Rescuing your Dad is your chance.

207
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:30,207
Your Dad?

208
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:36,339
If I had just cut my losses at the invasion,
maybe we wouldn't be in this mess.

209
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,602
Maybe sometimes it's just
better to call it quits before you fail.

210
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:44,934
No, it's not. Look Sokka,
you're going to fail a lot before things work out.

211
00:20:45,422 --> 00:20:47,022
That's supposed to
make me feel better?

212
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:50,370
Even though you'll probably
fail over and over and over again.

213
00:20:50,437 --> 00:20:51,937
Seriously, not helping.

214
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:57,042
You have to try every time. You can't
quit because you're afraid you might fail.

215
00:20:57,486 --> 00:21:00,986
Hey, if you two are done
cuddling, can we get a move on?

216
00:21:02,101 --> 00:21:08,101
No, I'm staying. You guys go.
You've been here long enough.

217
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
I'm not leaving without you, Sokka.

218
00:21:10,582 --> 00:21:11,882
I'm staying too.

219
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:14,901
Not me, I'm out.
Let's roll baby.

220
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:22,530
We gave up our only chance of escaping.
I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake.

221
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:39,992
Argh, this current is so slow.
I can use this to paddle.

222
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:58,247
Guards! Secure the perimeter
and lock down the prisoners. Now!

223
00:22:04,003 --> 00:22:06,503
The plan failed!
They're caught.

224
00:22:07,132 --> 00:22:10,132
Get the fugitives and
throw them in the Cooler!

225
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:12,433
Uh, they are
in the cooler sir.

226
00:22:12,547 --> 00:22:17,047
One that's bolted down and not
floating in the water! This is a lockdown!

227
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:21,528
We have new prisoners arriving!
Everything must be completely secure!

228
00:22:34,943 --> 00:22:36,443
The gondola's moving.

229
00:22:46,663 --> 00:22:47,663
This is it.

230
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,972
If my Dad's not there,
we risked everything for nothing.

231
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:57,089
We had to.

232
00:22:58,316 --> 00:22:59,616
Come on,
come on.

233
00:23:03,635 --> 00:23:04,635
Zuko:
Is that him?

234
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,875
My Dad doesn't have a nose ring.

235
00:23:10,343 --> 00:23:11,343
Where is he?

236
00:23:14,808 --> 00:23:18,708
- That's it? That can't be it.
- I'm sorry Sokka.

237
00:23:18,757 --> 00:23:19,957
Oh no.

238
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:23,729
Guard:
Hey you, get off the gondola.

239
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:36,482
Dad.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
