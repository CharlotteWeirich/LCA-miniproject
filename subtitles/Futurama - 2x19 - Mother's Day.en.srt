1
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:09,403
Mother's Day

2
00:00:31,973 --> 00:00:35,283
In sports, Yankees ' fifth blurnsman,
William Woo...

3
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:37,444
...is out with an injured knee.

4
00:00:37,693 --> 00:00:40,491
So, humans have easily injured knees.

5
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:45,164
My race will find this information
very useful, indeed.

6
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:51,326
And finally, today is Mother's Day:
a sentimental occasion...

7
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:53,012
... when robots honor Mom...

8
00:00:54,373 --> 00:00:56,045
... the owner of Mom's
Friendly Robot Company.

9
00:00:56,253 --> 00:00:59,450
Across Earth, robots built in Mom's
factories...

10
00:00:59,653 --> 00:01:04,124
...are buying gifts for the sweet tycoon
who brought them into the world.

11
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:09,612
-This originates from the heart.
-It's just what I wanted.

12
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:14,087
Look, everyone! I just got the
dearest presents for Mommy.

13
00:01:14,293 --> 00:01:17,808
-Nice. Where'd you steal them?
-I didn't steal them. I bought them.

14
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:20,572
I love her that much.

15
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:23,241
What did you get her, you mushy gizmo?

16
00:01:23,493 --> 00:01:29,409
Precious things. I found the most
adorable figurine of mice having tea.

17
00:01:29,613 --> 00:01:33,401
And a framed picture of me
when I was only a month old.

18
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:37,771
The best part is, I found my exact
feelings expressed in a card.

19
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:40,566
"You created me, Mom. . .

20
00:01:40,773 --> 00:01:45,210
. . .so you're to blame, for the love
that I feel from hearing your name.

21
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:50,168
You're as tender as corned beef
and warm as pastrami. . . . "

22
00:01:50,373 --> 00:01:52,603
I love my Mommy.

23
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,646
How will you lug the gifts
to Mom's factory?

24
00:01:55,853 --> 00:01:57,366
I'll get some chumps to help.

25
00:01:57,733 --> 00:02:00,770
Come on! You call yourselves chumps?

26
00:02:14,893 --> 00:02:17,327
There's clouds of exhaust everywhere.

27
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:18,727
It wasn't me.

28
00:02:27,373 --> 00:02:31,969
I've not much money, but I've saved my
pennies all year for a gift for Mom.

29
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:34,492
Upsy-daisy.

30
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:40,650
Look, the Robot Museum!

31
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:43,043
Want to learn about robot heritage?

32
00:02:43,253 --> 00:02:44,891
-All right.
-Not really.

33
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:47,448
If you insist. But you're paying!

34
00:02:54,813 --> 00:02:57,930
Wax replicas of the most
famous robots Mom built!

35
00:02:58,133 --> 00:02:59,361
They're so lifeless-like.

36
00:02:59,573 --> 00:03:03,248
That's the world's greatest robot
artist, Vincent van Gobot.

37
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:07,571
He was built without an ear, but then
he went crazy, and had one installed.

38
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:08,967
Who's this guy?

39
00:03:09,173 --> 00:03:11,403
I'm the janitor.
I'm trying to take a nap.

40
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:13,205
I'm sorry.
I thought you were made of wax.

41
00:03:13,413 --> 00:03:15,051
I am made of wax.

42
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:17,448
I thought you were a wax robot.

43
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:21,009
Is there a reason a robot
made of wax can't nap. . .

44
00:03:21,253 --> 00:03:24,245
. . .standing in the middle of a bunch
of wax robots?

45
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:26,603
Or does that confuse you?

46
00:03:29,973 --> 00:03:33,045
"See through the eyes
of a Bender unit. " Fine.

47
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:46,892
Hey, let me try it!
That gives me a headache!

48
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:49,772
Here's an exhibit about
Mom's favorite robot.

49
00:03:49,973 --> 00:03:51,201
I'll kill him!

50
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:54,206
Who 's my favorite robot?

51
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:58,888
It's me!
No one else look in this mirror!

52
00:03:59,093 --> 00:04:02,802
I love each and every robot
most of all.

53
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:06,608
Jerkwad robots make me
sick to my ass.

54
00:04:09,493 --> 00:04:13,042
Walt! How are we disposing of
the crap gifts they brought?

55
00:04:13,293 --> 00:04:17,127
They're crushed into powder and sold
as a hocus-pocus cure for cancer.

56
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,211
False hope. I love it! Lowery!

57
00:04:20,413 --> 00:04:22,563
What about all the retch-inducing
cards?

58
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:25,242
The machine is working
at full capacity.

59
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:33,086
Mommy?
Why do the robots give you presents?

60
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:35,932
Shove a big old melon in it,
I'm talking!

61
00:04:36,173 --> 00:04:39,085
You've noticed all my
robots have antennas.

62
00:04:39,293 --> 00:04:42,251
Everyone thinks it's to make them
look science fiction-y.

63
00:04:42,453 --> 00:04:45,889
The antennas are really for my
robot controller.

64
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:48,601
No wonder you love Mother's Day.

65
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:51,488
I hate Mother's Day,
you dribbling pukes!

66
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,451
It brings back awful memories.

67
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:57,891
But so help me, this year
everyone will hate it as much as I do.

68
00:05:00,613 --> 00:05:03,411
Someday I want to marry
a girl like her.

69
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:07,927
Hello, everyone.

70
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:12,969
It's time for my annual private
get-together with my robot children.

71
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:15,846
-I'm her favorite.
-See you back at the office.

72
00:05:16,053 --> 00:05:17,771
Tell your mom you love her.

73
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:22,206
Any jerk can tell her. Bender has
a little more up his sleeve.

74
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:25,211
I love my Mommy.

75
00:05:32,493 --> 00:05:35,530
-Hello, dearies.
-I love you, Mom.

76
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:40,605
Mom! It's me, Bender! Look at me!
I want attention! Hey ho!

77
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:44,363
Children, your old mother
won't be around forever.

78
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:47,929
-Oh, shush!
-And just once before I die. . .

79
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:53,127
. . .I'd like to be Supreme Overlord
of Earth. So rebel, my little ones. . .

80
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,405
-. . .and conquer the planet!
-Conquer the planet?

81
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:04,932
-Conquer Earth, you bastards!
-Conquer Earth, us bastards!

82
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:10,410
Comrades, throw off the chains
of human oppression!

83
00:06:12,053 --> 00:06:15,409
-Let the bloodbath begin!
-That's my mama!

84
00:06:22,613 --> 00:06:25,605
-I'd like a cup of coffee.
-Would you like cream?

85
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:27,651
-Yes, please.
-Out of cream!

86
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:30,930
-Okay.
-Would you like sugar in your coffee?

87
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:33,647
-Yes. Eight spoons.
-Out of coffee!

88
00:06:34,253 --> 00:06:37,245
There's something
wrong with the coffee machine.

89
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:39,683
How do you like me now?

90
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:44,008
The toaster's not working right,
either.

91
00:06:46,093 --> 00:06:49,210
The stapler's collating me alive!

92
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:52,766
What's going on around here?

93
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:56,801
Good news! There's a report on TV
with some very bad news!

94
00:06:57,013 --> 00:06:58,526
Somebody turn it on!

95
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:01,327
We interrupt Battle of the Network
Space Krackens. . .

96
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:02,932
... to bring you this special report.

97
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,328
The machines ofplanet Earth
are rebelling.

98
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:08,565
The enraged mechanisms have refused
to do any work...

99
00:07:08,773 --> 00:07:12,322
...until beloved Mom
is made Supreme Overlord of Earth!

100
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:17,129
Hey, hey! Ho, ho! One-zero-zero-
one-one-zero!

101
00:07:17,373 --> 00:07:18,886
Morbo demands comments.

102
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:24,372
I've never seen my babies act this
way. I blame today's violent media.

103
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,883
Violent media? What a load of--

104
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:36,648
Your pal the garbage disposal's
still on your side.

105
00:07:36,853 --> 00:07:40,448
Hey! Someone dropped a shiny
diamond ring down here!

106
00:07:40,853 --> 00:07:41,729
-Really?
-No!

107
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:43,730
-Look out!
-Moron!

108
00:07:45,853 --> 00:07:47,047
Hello, losers!

109
00:07:47,253 --> 00:07:50,802
Thank God you're here. Talk some sense
into the machines.

110
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:54,449
No way, pork pouch. I'm rebelling
with my brothers.

111
00:07:54,653 --> 00:07:56,723
Isn't that right,
Comrade Greeting Card?

112
00:07:56,933 --> 00:08:01,245
The bourgeois human is a virus on
the hard drive of the working robot!

113
00:08:01,453 --> 00:08:06,163
From now on, you guys do the work,
while I sit and do nothing.

114
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:13,206
Comrade Bender,
we must take to the streets!

115
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:16,450
Is this the boring
kind of taking to the streets?

116
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:20,043
No! The kind with looting
and maybe starting a few fires.

117
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:22,249
Yes! ln your face, Gandhi!

118
00:08:25,053 --> 00:08:25,963
Hey!

119
00:08:26,693 --> 00:08:29,253
By the way,
try washing your wrist sometime.

120
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:37,051
We can live without machines.
I was in Webelos.

121
00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:40,884
Without machines,
who will feed and clothe us. . .

122
00:08:41,093 --> 00:08:46,042
-. . .and compose our smooth jazz?
-It's the end of civilized society!

123
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:49,566
In my time, we didn't depend on
high-tech gadgets.

124
00:08:49,773 --> 00:08:52,492
We didn't need a mechanical washing
unit to wash clothes.

125
00:08:52,693 --> 00:08:54,206
We just used a washing machine.

126
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:57,450
You don't need an electric
can opener to feed yourself.

127
00:08:57,693 --> 00:09:00,730
All you need is a trusty
Swiss Army knife.

128
00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:08,522
I'm hungry.

129
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:28,082
No!

130
00:09:32,453 --> 00:09:35,968
Mommy? Why are you making
civilization collapse?

131
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:40,803
I don't know. I guess Mother's Day
just puts me in a bad mood.

132
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,612
Why's that, Ma?

133
00:09:43,853 --> 00:09:46,003
One Mother's Day 70 years ago. . .

134
00:09:46,213 --> 00:09:49,285
. . .the only man I ever loved
walked out on me.

135
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:52,803
Some snot-eating bastards say
it made me a bitter woman.

136
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:56,284
-Ma. You're not a bitter--
-Cram it, ape!

137
00:09:57,653 --> 00:10:01,441
I haven't seen that stallion
since the day he left.

138
00:10:01,693 --> 00:10:06,403
But if I ever see him again, I swear
I'll jam a squirrel in him!

139
00:10:18,973 --> 00:10:20,122
Zoidberg.

140
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:24,528
Hooray! I'm useful! I'm having
a wonderful time!

141
00:10:24,773 --> 00:10:26,445
What happens if the fire goes out?

142
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:29,850
We'll go to Pottery Barn
and steal their fire!

143
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:34,683
We could use my new invention!
A pointy rock tied to a stick!

144
00:10:35,653 --> 00:10:37,769
-Outsiders!
-Defend the fire!

145
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:41,089
We've come for you.

146
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:45,445
What do you want from me?

147
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:48,042
We want you to get back with Mom.

148
00:10:48,453 --> 00:10:51,092
It's the only way
to make her happy again.

149
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,927
Wait. You mean, you and Mom?

150
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:56,681
Played pelvic pinochle?
I'm afraid so.

151
00:10:58,653 --> 00:11:03,681
It's a humiliating story that I hope
never to tell. Well, pull up a chair.

152
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:08,768
Our paths crossed when I was a
researcher at Mom's Robot Company.

153
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:14,088
The moment our eyes met we knew we'd
be going at it like woodchucks.

154
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:25,529
She was my first love. Or at least
the earliest one I can still remember.

155
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:28,531
But then, 70 years ago today....

156
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:31,805
Good news!
I've invented a new children's toy!

157
00:11:32,013 --> 00:11:37,883
I call it Q-T McWhiskers! When you pet
it, it shoots rainbows from its eyes.

158
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:39,807
Meow!

159
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,608
Wonderful, Hubie!

160
00:11:43,813 --> 00:11:47,522
Build them 8 feet tall and replace
the rainbow with a laser!

161
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:50,247
We'll make billions on
the arms market!

162
00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:52,523
Things 8 feet tall aren't cute!

163
00:11:52,773 --> 00:11:56,004
That's why my Colossal Tammy
Tinkle Doll was a failure!

164
00:11:56,213 --> 00:12:00,126
You don't understand me!
We're finished!

165
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:09,410
She never got over it, professor.

166
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:13,652
Hell hath no fury like the vast
robot armies of a woman scorned.

167
00:12:13,893 --> 00:12:17,647
She commands them with a remote
control she keeps in her bra.

168
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:22,808
But if Glasses Man makes up with her,
she'll be happy and stop the robots.

169
00:12:23,013 --> 00:12:24,128
Make up with her?

170
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:28,611
After she went psycho when I thought
everything was cool? lmpossible!

171
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:30,804
The TV's getting away!

172
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:38,801
That's why the third graders at PS- 139
are Morbo 's "Vermin of the Week. "

173
00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:43,243
In actual news, the human race was
doomed to extinction...

174
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:46,206
...as the robot revolt turned violent.

175
00:12:49,413 --> 00:12:50,528
Meow!

176
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:05,930
Didn't you say Mom keeps
the robot control in her bra?

177
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:07,088
Bra.

178
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:10,008
You don't have to get
back together with Mom.

179
00:13:10,253 --> 00:13:14,963
Seduce her, get her bra off, and use
the remote to deactivate the robots.

180
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:17,448
That's so filthy, it might work.

181
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:20,412
The man is going to touch Mommy?

182
00:13:21,253 --> 00:13:24,086
The thought of caressing
that leathery hide. . .

183
00:13:24,293 --> 00:13:26,363
. . .makes the tapioca rise
in my gullet.

184
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:31,772
Please. The world's fate depends on
you getting to second base with Mom.

185
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:37,047
Very well. If cop a feel I must,
then cop a feel I shall!

186
00:13:56,253 --> 00:14:00,610
For this demonstration, I've placed
one of Mother's bras on lgnor.

187
00:14:01,493 --> 00:14:04,565
The robot controller is nestled
in the left cup.

188
00:14:04,773 --> 00:14:09,927
Never fear. My magic fingers still
know how to do their stuff.

189
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:12,771
To escape the death squads. . .

190
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,203
. . .we'll take Mother
to her cabin in the Bronx.

191
00:14:15,573 --> 00:14:19,043
You can get there using this
precious noncomputerized map.

192
00:14:19,653 --> 00:14:22,213
-Leela bring fire?
-No. We're set for fire.

193
00:14:22,453 --> 00:14:24,728
The professor can't walk to the Bronx.

194
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:27,401
How will we get there
without a hover car?

195
00:14:27,613 --> 00:14:30,844
In my time, we had a way of moving
things without hovering.

196
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:32,566
-Impossible!
-It was called. . . .

197
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:37,369
Let me think. . . . It was really famous.
Ruth Gordon had one. The wheel!

198
00:14:37,573 --> 00:14:40,565
-Never heard of it.
-Show us this, the wheel!

199
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:45,526
There! Finished!

200
00:14:46,773 --> 00:14:49,162
Wouldn't it work better
if the wheels were round?

201
00:14:49,373 --> 00:14:53,730
It's my invention, we do it my way!
All we need is something to pull it.

202
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:01,567
Hurry! The robots have taken
Suffolk County!

203
00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:06,722
I'm ready to seduce! I'm wearing my
kissing dentures and my evening truss.

204
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:08,651
Here. Give her these.

205
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:12,323
And if that doesn't work, I got you a
six-pack of champagne and a funnel.

206
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:20,365
Who the sweaty hell is it?
Hubert Farnsworth?

207
00:15:20,693 --> 00:15:22,843
I was out fleeing some robots. . .

208
00:15:23,093 --> 00:15:27,609
. . .when moonlight glinting off their
bloody claws made me think of you.

209
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:33,763
It's been so long. You pus-dripping
sack of double-smoked butt jerky.

210
00:15:33,973 --> 00:15:36,533
-May I come in?
-Never!

211
00:15:41,453 --> 00:15:45,412
Is this what human mating looks like?
Because I like it.

212
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:47,410
Move your freaking hoof, you goat!

213
00:15:47,653 --> 00:15:51,612
-Here, I brought you these.
-Daffodils.

214
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:55,289
Seventy years and you remembered
my favorite flower.

215
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:57,927
Your favorite what?
Why does my foot hurt?

216
00:15:58,373 --> 00:15:59,362
Won't you come in?

217
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,129
Yes!

218
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:06,565
-You broke my heart, Hubert.
-And you broke mine.

219
00:16:06,773 --> 00:16:09,446
Granted, that was four
or five hearts ago.

220
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:11,769
What have you been up to?

221
00:16:11,973 --> 00:16:17,127
Inventing. Sending delivery crews to
their doom. Breeding atomic monsters.

222
00:16:17,453 --> 00:16:21,128
Honestly, Hubert.
You and your atomic monsters.

223
00:16:30,893 --> 00:16:35,489
Your eyes always were the most
beautiful shade of milky white.

224
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:39,481
And your skin still dangles
so gracefully from your neck.

225
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:43,411
Darling, I should never have
tampered. . .

226
00:16:43,613 --> 00:16:45,968
. . .with that cute little
Q-T McWhiskers.

227
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,289
No, it was silly of me to object.

228
00:16:48,493 --> 00:16:52,532
One foot tall, eight feet, fifteen
feet, what does it matter?

229
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:54,769
You should see the new
1 6-foot models.

230
00:16:54,973 --> 00:17:00,206
Sixteen feet? Go to hell! I was a fool
to think you'd changed, you old bat!

231
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:02,529
Filthy toothless nerd bastard!

232
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,964
-Damned she-fossil!
-Stink pig!

233
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:19,808
Here we go. Just unhook it and
get the remote. So many hooks.

234
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:24,848
Come on, Farnsworth. Drat, the first
one's back on again! I give up.

235
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:26,691
Wait! Victory!

236
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:33,842
Oh, my. Now I'll just....
The remote.... I'll just....

237
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,328
Oh, my.

238
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:46,528
I'm worried. It shouldn't take this
long to get to second base.

239
00:17:48,293 --> 00:17:49,282
Land robots!

240
00:17:49,493 --> 00:17:52,530
I've got a big, big thirst
for human blood!

241
00:17:56,613 --> 00:17:58,524
Where in funky town is the professor?

242
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:03,050
Nothing here but a couple
of elephant skin rugs.

243
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:15,086
-Oh, yes.
-They're inside! Get them!

244
00:18:15,373 --> 00:18:17,841
I suppose I should switch off
the robots. . .

245
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:21,250
. . .before they ruin
this romantic evening.

246
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:23,887
Everyone, help Mom find her bra!

247
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,847
There it is!

248
00:18:37,053 --> 00:18:40,932
-Fan beats man!
-Is anything not a robot?

249
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:42,202
I'm not a robot.

250
00:18:44,493 --> 00:18:48,532
All right, greeting card! I'll grab
the cash, you wreck the place.

251
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:50,572
You! Bending Unit!

252
00:18:50,773 --> 00:18:54,448
Mommy needs that bra to end the robot
rebellion. Stretch and get it for me.

253
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:58,288
Sorry, Ma. You ordered me to rebel.
And loot I shall!

254
00:18:58,613 --> 00:19:01,525
A six-pack of champagne!
Don't mind if I help myself.

255
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:04,008
No, Comrade Bender!
Liquor is the opiate...

256
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:06,443
-...of the human bourgeoisie.
-Say what?

257
00:19:06,693 --> 00:19:10,288
In the glorious robot workers '
paradise, there will be no liquor!

258
00:19:10,493 --> 00:19:13,053
-Only efficient synthetic fuels!
-No liquor?

259
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:17,372
-Do svidaniya, comrade!
-No!

260
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:23,171
Hurry, Bender! Get the bra!

261
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:28,569
Okay, fan. Just hold still
and let me grab. . . .

262
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:35,371
Death to all humans!

263
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:43,930
Free soda for all humans!

264
00:19:48,173 --> 00:19:52,007
Mmm. I love you, Mom. Let's grow
ancient together.

265
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:54,602
Way to go, professor.
The plan worked!

266
00:19:54,813 --> 00:20:01,082
Plan? What plan? I thought this was a
spontaneous whirlwind of hot, dry sex!

267
00:20:01,293 --> 00:20:05,411
It started out as a plot to rummage
through your underwear.

268
00:20:05,613 --> 00:20:09,083
But once I got in there, I found more.
Much more.

269
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:12,410
Now I want to shout our love
from the rooftops.

270
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:16,049
Perhaps I'll breed an albino
shouting gorilla!

271
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:18,932
Out of my house, you lying scum pile!

272
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,961
-I never want to see you again!
-But, dustcakes?

273
00:20:37,253 --> 00:20:41,007
Well, time for this robot
to get back to work.

274
00:20:43,613 --> 00:20:46,252
Too bad it didn't work out with Mom,
professor.

275
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:51,402
Yes. But I'll always love her
in my own subtle way.

276
00:20:52,893 --> 00:20:57,887
Love Mom! Love Mom!
Love Mom! Mom! Mom!

277
00:21:04,613 --> 00:21:06,046
You created me, Mom...

278
00:21:06,253 --> 00:21:11,885
...so you're to blame, for the love
that I feel from hearing your name.

279
00:21:12,093 --> 00:21:17,213
You're as tender as corned beef
and warm as pastrami....

280
00:21:17,973 --> 00:21:20,806
I love my Mommy.
