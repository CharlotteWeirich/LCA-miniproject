4
00:00:25,218 --> 00:00:26,718
Double time, soldier.

5
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:29,255
I want this ice fishing
operation up and running

6
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,697
by 0800 hours.

7
00:00:30,972 --> 00:00:33,347
It's too cold, Dad.

8
00:00:33,472 --> 00:00:35,035
My teen region is freezing off.

9
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,405
You don't know what cold is.

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,309
I once survived an entire week
trapped in a Swiss glacier,

11
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:43,460
eating nothing but
frozen Neanderthal.

12
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,755
To this day I can't stand
the taste of early hominid.

13
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:49,484
Let's just get inside the shack.

14
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:50,926
- Hold, maggot!
- Ow!

15
00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:52,921
Remember the code of the ice:

16
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:55,223
Thick and blue, tried and true;

17
00:00:55,348 --> 00:00:57,759
thin and crispy, way too risky.

18
00:00:57,884 --> 00:00:59,261
Shows what you know.

19
00:00:59,386 --> 00:01:00,894
Crispy doesn't even rhyme with risky.

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,062
Aah!

21
00:01:02,322 --> 00:01:03,665
Help, I'm drowning!

22
00:01:05,292 --> 00:01:09,361
Don't worry, son, you'll
freeze before you drown.

23
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:19,413
I love ice fishing.

24
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:21,456
I shouldn't be out in this cold.

25
00:01:21,808 --> 00:01:24,753
I have no protective fat, hair
or warm blood.

26
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:26,588
I'm not even legally a mammal.

27
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:28,857
You don't know what cold is.

28
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:31,089
I was frozen for a thousand years.

29
00:01:31,214 --> 00:01:31,893
You were?

30
00:01:32,018 --> 00:01:34,553
Huh, learn something dumb every day.

31
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,973
Live bait.

32
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:40,268
Get your live bait here.

33
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:43,238
Fresh killed bait.

34
00:01:44,964 --> 00:01:46,775
Can we get inside the shack?

35
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,608
I'm wearing a belly parka.

36
00:01:51,137 --> 00:01:53,515
If I understand ice fishing,
and I'm pretty sure I don't,

37
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,784
we'll need to laser-blast
a hole in the ice.

38
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:58,386
No, no crazy technology.

39
00:01:58,511 --> 00:02:00,956
Here, Bender, use
your immense robot strength

40
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:02,706
to drill a hole
the old-fashioned way.

41
00:02:02,949 --> 00:02:04,624
I don't see any irony in that.

42
00:02:10,323 --> 00:02:12,132
And voilà !

43
00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:15,003
Everybody's ice fishing.

44
00:02:15,128 --> 00:02:16,720
How come nobody's ice fishing?

45
00:02:16,996 --> 00:02:20,015
Hot cocoa break.

46
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,876
Cocoa is for yodeling babies.

47
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:24,913
If you're sober,
it isn't ice fishing.

48
00:02:30,176 --> 00:02:32,854
Mom, what's my temperature?

49
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:35,957
50, 45, 40.

50
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:37,225
It's all over.

51
00:02:38,952 --> 00:02:40,695
Whoo!

52
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,197
Down at the 35!

53
00:02:42,322 --> 00:02:43,832
I'm really sick.

54
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:45,667
Huh?
Oh, sorry.

55
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:47,068
A hundred and nine.

56
00:02:47,193 --> 00:02:48,543
We'll check it again at halftime.

57
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:51,379
You home from school, you traitor?

58
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:53,924
I fell through the ice.
Cut me some slack.

59
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:57,345
Nobody cut me any slack
when I broke my spine.

60
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,947
Didn't even take a day off of work.

61
00:02:59,072 --> 00:03:00,415
Lot of people depend on you

62
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,742
when you sell trampolines
door to door.

63
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,687
Here's your homework, you lucky knob.

64
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:08,230
And with a little more luck
from my seven-leaf clover,

65
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,992
I might get sick enough
to miss the whole semester.

66
00:03:11,117 --> 00:03:12,160
Hey, give me that.

67
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,896
No.

68
00:03:15,021 --> 00:03:16,031
Give it to me, you faker.

69
00:03:16,156 --> 00:03:17,697
No, you're not getting it.

70
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:21,169
Ow, my underbite.

71
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:22,786
Come on, Yancy,

72
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,372
your brother's sick.

73
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:26,498
You'll never have
a better chance to take him out.

74
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,625
Dad.

75
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,853
"Nerd Search '88"?

76
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:31,711
What's this?

77
00:03:31,971 --> 00:03:34,282
Some stupid science contest
for smartwads.

78
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:37,801
NASA's going to pick one kid's
experiment to launch into space.

79
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,088
I could make a space experiment.

80
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:41,823
I just got a new thing of glitter.

81
00:03:41,948 --> 00:03:43,758
I'm not sure science is your thing,

82
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:46,027
seeing how that chimp
at the zoo tricked you

83
00:03:46,152 --> 00:03:47,352
out of your allowance.

84
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,098
Yeah, well, I'll show you
and Mr. Bananas.

85
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:51,933
Anyway, I've got nothing better to do

86
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:53,275
while I'm sick in bed.

87
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,103
Wait, that's it.

88
00:03:55,228 --> 00:03:56,971
I'll make a space experiment
about the common cold.

89
00:03:57,096 --> 00:03:58,864
Where's that contest flyer?

90
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:00,532
You're holding it, genius.

91
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:02,534
Oh, good.

92
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:07,048
I feel awful, but it was worth it

93
00:04:07,173 --> 00:04:09,284
to catch and kill this baby fish.

94
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,921
Shmeez, what's with
the shmiffling?

95
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:14,189
It's nothing.

96
00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:16,172
Just a common cold.

97
00:04:16,338 --> 00:04:17,757
- Wha...?
- Common huh?

98
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:20,762
- What the hell's a common cold?
- Is it valuable?

99
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:24,472
Could it be taken from you
if you were, say, unconscious?

100
00:04:24,638 --> 00:04:26,301
A common-- a common cold?!

101
00:04:26,426 --> 00:04:28,336
No, no...!

102
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:30,305
Ever since Fry first came to us,

103
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,982
I've lived in mortal terror
that this would happen.

104
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:35,610
I never heard you mention that.

105
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:39,112
Oh, I try to act cool, but
inside I'm freaking out.

106
00:04:39,372 --> 00:04:40,548
It's just a cold.

107
00:04:40,673 --> 00:04:42,250
What's the big deal?

108
00:04:54,987 --> 00:04:57,198
This is the police.

109
00:04:57,323 --> 00:05:00,335
An unknown pathogen has been
detected on these premises.

110
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,502
Come out with your hands...

111
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:04,679
I mean, stay in with your hands up.

112
00:05:04,945 --> 00:05:07,768
You are hereby quarantined
until such time

113
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:11,061
as it is deemed safe to enter
and shoot your asses.

114
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:16,049
Now, now, let's not
all panic at once.

115
00:05:16,174 --> 00:05:17,624
We'll have to take shifts.

116
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:20,237
Hermes, you take the first six hours.

117
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:22,528
Very well.

118
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:25,158
Louder, louder!

119
00:05:26,017 --> 00:05:27,410
Right, baby.

120
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,394
Look, I just have a common...

121
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,921
...cold!

122
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:39,998
It'll be gone as fast
as I can sneeze, hurl,

123
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:41,383
and squirt it out.

124
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,093
No, it won't.

125
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:46,846
The common cold died out
500 years ago,

126
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:50,541
and subsequently, humanity lost
all resistance to its ravages,

127
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,978
but the virus survived in you,

128
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:55,246
frozen for a thousand years.

129
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:58,016
Huh, so it was hiding
deep down inside of me,

130
00:05:58,141 --> 00:05:59,734
like my skeleton bones?

131
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,019
Give it to us straight, Professor.

132
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:02,954
How incredibly deadly is it?

133
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,355
We don't know.

134
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,758
It could kill millions or nobody.

135
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:10,194
I suppose it might even bring
a few people back to life.

136
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,263
Anything is possible in science.

137
00:06:13,656 --> 00:06:16,534
Oh, no, I've got it, too.

138
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:20,588
My nose is all gunked up with blork.

139
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:22,674
And I've got a hankering
for a useless remedy

140
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,410
created by a schoolteacher.

141
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,547
Uh-oh, I think
I'm getting swollen glands.

142
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,229
Screw the quarantine,
I'm out of here.

143
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,064
Initiate containment procedure.

144
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:41,426
Aah, ow, oh!

145
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:43,294
Go on now.

146
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,064
Now I'm sick.

147
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:48,533
I shudder to think
what this cold will do to me.

148
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:52,037
Yesterday I was nearly killed
by a tight hat.

149
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,439
I'd be remiss if I didn't rub
your goopy noses

150
00:06:54,564 --> 00:06:56,007
in the fact that I'm immune.

151
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,145
Which is why we'll all be
counting on you and you alone

152
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,181
to nurse us through this catastrophe.

153
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,616
Why, God?

154
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:08,319
Why have I been singled out?

155
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:15,484
Everyone just calm down and make
yourself a tissue walrus.

156
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,398
Damn it, son, lose the tissues.

157
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,633
You're ruining Thanksgiving dinner.

158
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:25,036
I'm busy with my space experiment.

159
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,198
I can't devote precious
brainpower to blowing my nose.

160
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:31,109
You're never going to win
that science fair, Philip.

161
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:33,544
Face it, someone
with your limited brainpower

162
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:36,998
would be lucky to get a job
as a pizza delivery boy.

163
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:41,185
Hey, Barack,
pizza going out, come on.

00:16:51,926 --> 00:16:53,436
and released into orbit.

329
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:58,674
Hmm. All ancient satellites were
swept up as space junk in 2113.

330
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,009
I actually knew that offhand.

331
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:02,044
I'm Facebooking right now.

332
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:04,447
Aha!

333
00:17:04,572 --> 00:17:07,116
That satellite was scuttled
on Enceladus,

334
00:17:07,241 --> 00:17:09,819
Saturn's main dump moon.

335
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:11,211
Let's dump it up!

336
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:21,430
This is the exact location of the dump,

337
00:17:21,555 --> 00:17:23,366
but there's nothing here.

338
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:25,268
Can we please go home and die now?

339
00:17:25,393 --> 00:17:27,203
I'm with Bender.

340
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:28,905
Whatever was here has been covered

341
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,073
by centuries of ice buildup.

342
00:17:31,198 --> 00:17:32,909
No! It's under here somewhere!

343
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:35,388
We just have to bust our way down.

344
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,079
Remember the code of the ice.

345
00:17:37,204 --> 00:17:39,749
Thin and crispy, way too risky!

346
00:17:46,826 --> 00:17:48,859
I found the satellite!

347
00:17:49,116 --> 00:17:54,163
Let's just hope
the experiment's still in here.

348
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:56,465
Yes! We're saved!

349
00:17:58,292 --> 00:18:01,771
And now, to present the awards,
our very special guest.

350
00:18:01,896 --> 00:18:03,506
He walked on the moon,

351
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:06,475
and now he is judging
a high school science contest.

352
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,779
Truly a man who can
and will do anything:

353
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:11,280
Dr. Buzz Aldrin!

354
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:15,918
Wow. I could have used
an introduction like that

355
00:18:16,043 --> 00:18:18,521
when I first met the moon men.

356
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,492
But seriously, there <i>are</i> moon men.

357
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:27,063
Okay, this year's
Nerd Search runner-up

358
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:30,399
is a young man who devised
a way to add and subtract

359
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:36,305
in zero gravity-- Vijay Patel
and his calculator space hat!

360
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:42,612
And now, the grand prize winner

361
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:45,915
whose experiment will be
launched into space...

362
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,020
Look at that cocky smirk.

363
00:18:51,145 --> 00:18:52,923
My money's on Gedgie.

364
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:55,358
Yeah? He may have brains,
but I have heart.

365
00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:57,293
Josh Gedgie!

366
00:18:58,853 --> 00:19:01,054
I'll bring the car around.

367
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,412
What a well-prepared virus culture.

368
00:19:16,537 --> 00:19:19,181
This will make a fine vaccine.

369
00:19:19,306 --> 00:19:21,050
Good thing Gedgie won.

370
00:19:21,175 --> 00:19:23,352
My dumb experiment wouldn't
have lasted an hour in space,

371
00:19:23,477 --> 00:19:25,354
let alone a thousand years.

372
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:28,524
Besides, Buzz Aldrin ran over my
guinea pig in the parking lot.

373
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:30,226
Okay.

374
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:33,396
Come on, gang,
let's go inoculate everyone

375
00:19:33,521 --> 00:19:36,990
and cram Manhattan
back into its rightful hole.

376
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,911
This may hurt a little.

377
00:19:49,036 --> 00:19:50,446
Ow!

378
00:19:50,571 --> 00:19:53,482
Now I'll give you the shot.

379
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:56,052
You saved millions of lives, Fry.

380
00:19:56,177 --> 00:19:59,479
You should feel proud, no matter
what your dad said to you.

381
00:20:09,557 --> 00:20:11,434
You still haven't thanked me

382
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:13,963
for pulling you out
of the lake, soldier.

383
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:16,085
I could have flip-flopped out.

384
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,030
I know that.

385
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,212
Look, son, I know I give you
the business sometimes.

386
00:20:23,337 --> 00:20:26,349
But if I'm hard on you,
it's only 'cause I want you

387
00:20:26,474 --> 00:20:28,918
to grow up strong and resilient.

388
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:31,945
Some day, you may face
adversities so preposterous,

389
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,490
I can't even conceive of them.

390
00:20:34,615 --> 00:20:38,051
But I know you'll pull through
and make me proud.

391
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,357
I love you, son.

392
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,009
<i>Now bundle up.</i>

393
00:20:54,134 --> 00:20:56,060
<i>I don't want you getting frozen.</i>

394
00:20:57,275 --> 00:21:00,801
