the four nations lived
together in harmony.

then everything changed
when the fire nation attacked.

only the avatar,
master of all four elements
could stop them.

needed him most

11

he vanished.

100 years passed and my brother
and i discovered the new avatar

00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,063
an airbender named aang.

14
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,399
and although his airbending
skills were great

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,635
he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.

00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,782
a wanted poster.

165
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,850
that's so great.

166
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,018
the runaway.

167
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,353
i love my new nickname.

168
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,521
is there a picture of me?

169
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:56,488
does it look good?

170
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,127
well, yeah, actually,
it does look pretty good.

171
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,163
but toph,
you're missing the point.

172
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,698
maybe katara was right.

173
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,966
these scams are drawing
too much attention to us.

174
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:10,536
don't be such a worrywart
like your sister.

175
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:11,904
think of it this way.

176
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:15,374
now you have plenty of money
to help with the invasion plan.

177
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,576
well, that is true.

178
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,312
i had this idea
of making armor for appa.

179
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,914
[growling]

180
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:25,984
here's a little extra
so you can get yourself
a nice map of the fire nation.

181
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:27,486
you know what?

182
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:29,154
make it an atlas.

183
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,757
i do like expensive atlases.

184
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:37,529
of course you do, and that's why
this wanted poster is going
to stay our little secret.

185
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,803
sokka, tell me
you didn't buy a bird.

186
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,372
not just a bird.

187
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:47,806
a messenger bird.

188
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,976
now we can send messages
all over the world,
even to gran-gran.

189
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,278
wow, how does it work?

190
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,715
hm, uh, i never actually
thought about that.

191
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,919
hawky, gran-gran, south pole.

[squealing]

195
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:07,726
hawky, make nice.

196
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:08,761
bad hawky.

[growling]

198
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,904
well, look who decided
to join us.

199
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,305
where have you two been?

200
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,040
off scamming again?

201
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:24,076
yes, we were.

202
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:27,646
and i suppose you don't think
what you're doing
is dangerous at all?

203
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,781
no, i don't.

204
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:29,782
really?

205
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,950
yes, really.

206
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:34,119
well then, what's this?

207
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,554
i don't know.

208
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,856
i mean, seriously,
what's with you people?

209
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,058
i'm blind.

210
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,859
it's a wanted poster of you.

211
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,127
the runaway.

212
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,529
is that what you're called now?

213
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,863
are you proud of this?

214
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,065
where did you get that?

215
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,333
it doesn't matter
where i got it.

216
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,067
the fact is...

217
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,101
you went through my stuff.

218
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,803
you had no right.

219
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:53,439
your stuff was messy,
and i was just straightening up

220
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,174
and i happened
to stumble across it.

221
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,775
that's a lie.

222
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,410
you're lying, katara.

223
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:02,715
fine, it's a lie,
but you've been so
out of control lately

224
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,416
i knew something was up.

225
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,052
i knew you were
hiding something, and you were.

226
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,289
don't you walk away from me
while i'm talking to you.

227
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,557
oh, really, mom?

228
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:12,825
or what are you going to do?

229
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:13,992
send me to my room?

230
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:15,494
i wish i could.

231
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:19,098
well, you can't,
because you're not my mom
and you're not their mom.

232
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,400
i never said i was.

233
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,635
no, but you certainly
act like it.

234
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:26,772
you think it's your job
to boss everyone around,
but it's not.

235
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:31,744
you're just a regular kid like
the rest of us, so stop acting
like you can tell me what to do.

236
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,946
i can do whatever i want.

237
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:37,683
i don't act that way.

238
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,785
sokka, do i act motherly?

239
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,787
hey, i'm staying
out of this one.

240
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:42,821
what do you think, aang?

241
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,323
do i act like a mom?

242
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:45,524
well, i...

243
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,726
stop rubbing your eye
and speak clearly when you talk.

244
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,761
yes, ma'am.

i can't be around you right now.

i know, hawky.

249

why can't they just get along?

250
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,945
hey, aang, you want to test out
my messenger hawk with me?

251
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:08,047
i've got an idea.

252
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,815
sure.

253
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:14,787
i'm gonna send a note to katara
and say it's from toph,
who wants to apologize.

254
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,889
then everyone
will be friends again.

255
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,626
i got to say, sokka,
you continue to impress me
with your ideas.

256
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:23,462
eh, it's a gift.

257
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:26,832
dear katara.

258
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,834
sorry for everything.

259
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:29,902

katara: i know this is
from you, sokka.

262
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,518
toph can't write.

263
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:50,456
ugh, you're all
driving me crazy.

264
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,491
i can't believe we forgot
toph can't write.

265
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,093
yep, we're idiots.

266
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:58,063
i guess plan b is,
we send a note to toph
pretending it's from katara.

267
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,432
i think we're gonna run into
a similar problem.

sorry, hawky.

270
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,737
looks like i'm gonna have to
do this without your help.

271
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:07,473
come on, we need to talk.

272
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,484
so let me guess.

273
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,352
you brought me out here
to tell me your sister's

274
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:22,855
not as annoying as
i make her out to be.

275
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:25,657
nah, she's pretty much a pain.

276
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,793
she's always got
to be right about everything

277
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:31,296
and she gets all bossy,
and involved,
and in your business.

278
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,999
toph: yeah, i don't know how
you can deal with it.

279
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,703
sokka: actually, in a way,
i rely on it.

280
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,004
toph: i don't understand.

281
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,041
when our mom died, that was
the hardest time in my life.

282
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:47,112
our family was a mess,
but katara,
she had so much strength.

283
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:50,382
she stepped up and took on
so much responsibility.

284
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:53,152
she helped fill the void
that was left by our mom.

285
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,688
i guess i never
thought about that.

286
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,023
i'm gonna tell you
something crazy.

287
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,025
i never told anyone this before

288
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:04,396
but honestly,
i'm not sure i can remember
what my mother looked like.

289
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:08,667
it really seems like,
my whole life, katara's been
the one looking out for me.

290
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:12,671
she's always been the one
that's there, and now

291
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:18,177
when i try to remember
my mom, katara's is
the only face i can picture.

292
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:23,582
toph: the truth is, sometimes
katara does act motherly, but
that's not always a bad thing.

293
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:27,486
she's compassionate and kind,
and she actually cares about me.

294
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:30,723
you know, the real me.

295
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:34,360
that's more than my own mom.

296
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:37,629
don't ever tell her
i said any of this.

you don't need to apologize.

to apologize.

i want to pull a scam with you.

what?

you've made in all your scams

how could you do this to me?

325
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:43,529
you betrayed me.

326
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,465
you brought this on yourself.

i had no choice.

328
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:56,608
you did the right thing
by turning in the runaway.

329
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,345
the right thing
is its own reward.

well, i'm happy
to hear you say that.

the actual reward.

that's the girl
you were looking for.

do you think this scam of theirs
should be taking this long?

the same thing.

it was a trap?

i'm against these scams.

katara, you are fun.

if nothing else, you're at least
fun to argue with.

i know your relationship with
your parents is complicated

what i said.

it's ok.

i was really mad
when you said that because,
well, because maybe it's true.

i try not to think about it,
but when i left,
i probably really hurt them.
