Book One: Water | Chapter Twenty:
The Siege of the North Part 2

2
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:15,828
I can't believe I lost him.

3
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:17,768
You did everything you could...

4
00:00:17,803 --> 00:00:20,649
...and now we need to do everything we can to get him back.

5
00:00:20,682 --> 00:00:24,986
Zuko can't have gotten far. We'll find him. Aang's gonna be fine.

6
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:26,935
Okay.

7
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:34,731
It's all right. You stay here, Momo, in case Aang comes back.

8
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:36,843
Yip! Yip!

9
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,243
Hello? I'm sorry to disturb you,...

10
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:11,786
...but I just really need to find the Moon and the Ocean spirits.

11
00:01:11,816 --> 00:01:14,750
Go... away.

12
00:01:15,915 --> 00:01:17,335
You're still here?

13
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:19,405
Yes! I need...

14
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:25,319
Perhaps that thing will help you? Chase it!

15
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:29,189
Finally!

16
00:01:36,298 --> 00:01:38,177
Come back!

17
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:42,144
Hello, Aang.

18
00:01:42,192 --> 00:01:43,948
Roku!

19
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:10,094
Shelter!

20
00:02:20,135 --> 00:02:26,505
Roku, the Water Tribe is under attack. I need to find the Ocean and Moon spirits!

21
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:30,287
The Ocean and the Moon are ancient spirits.

22
00:02:30,323 --> 00:02:36,360
They crossed over from the Spirit World to the Mortal World very near the beginning.

23
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:41,749
There is only one spirit I know of who is old enough to remember.

24
00:02:41,764 --> 00:02:42,595
Who?

25
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:51,621
The spirit's name is Koh. But he is very dangerous. They call him... the Face Stealer.

26
00:02:51,648 --> 00:02:57,527
When you speak with him you must be very careful to show no emotion at all...

27
00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:04,905
...not the slightest expression or he will steal your face!

28
00:03:22,357 --> 00:03:27,339
I finally have you. But I can't get you home because of this blizzard.

29
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:31,130
There's always something. Not that you would understand.

30
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:35,084
You're like my sister. Everything always... came easy to her.

31
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:39,103
She's a firebending prodigy... and everyone adores her.

32
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:44,808
My father says she was born lucky. He says I was lucky to be born.

33
00:03:44,847 --> 00:03:48,078
I don't need luck though, I don't want it.

34
00:03:48,117 --> 00:03:51,431
I've always had to struggle and fight and that's made me strong.

35
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:53,881
It's made me who I am.

36
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:26,488
I don't need to remind you we have a time limit.

37
00:04:26,503 --> 00:04:32,266
If we don't defeat the Water Tribe before the full moon rises they will be undefeatable.

38
00:04:32,327 --> 00:04:35,383
I assure you I have everything under control.

39
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:38,502
I intend to remove the moon as a factor.

40
00:04:38,536 --> 00:04:41,167
Remove the moon!? How?

41
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,771
Admiral Choi!

42
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:47,391
Prepare to meet your fate!

43
00:04:49,663 --> 00:04:55,834
As I was saying... years ago I stumbled upon a great and powerful secret...

44
00:04:55,886 --> 00:04:59,468
...the identity of the Moon Spirit's mortal form.

45
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:00,607
What?

46
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,641
I was a young Lieutenant serving under General Shu in the Earth Kingdom...

47
00:05:04,688 --> 00:05:11,210
I discovered a hidden library, underground in fact. I tore through scroll after scroll.

48
00:05:11,242 --> 00:05:17,667
One of them contained a detailed illustration and the words "moon" and "ocean."

49
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:22,761
I knew then that these spirits could be found... and killed.

50
00:05:22,775 --> 00:05:25,340
And that it was my destiny to do so.

51
00:05:25,371 --> 00:05:28,795
Zhao, the Spirits are not to be trifled with!

52
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:32,974
Yes, yes, I know you fear the Spirits, Iroh.

53
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:36,308
I've heard rumors about your journey into the Spirit World.

54
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:41,237
But the Ocean and Moon gave up their immortality to become a part of our world...

55
00:05:41,264 --> 00:05:45,108
...and now they will face the consequences!

56
00:06:02,176 --> 00:06:07,665
Oh! Whew! You're just a curly tailed blue nose.

57
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:16,740
Show no fear. Show no emotion at all.

58
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:33,956
Hello? I'm looking for a spirit named "Koh."

59
00:06:45,642 --> 00:06:48,266
Welcome!

60
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:50,973
Thank you.

61
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:57,142
My old friend, the Avatar. It's been a long time.

62
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:58,498
You know me?

63
00:06:58,525 --> 00:07:01,057
How could I forget you!

64
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:04,249
One of your previous incarnations tried to slay me!

65
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:07,418
It was eight or nine hundred years ago.

66
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:13,582
I didn't know that. Why did he... or I... try to kill you?

67
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:19,640
Oh... it was something about stealing the face of someone you loved...

68
00:07:25,524 --> 00:07:28,752
Of course, that's all behind us.

69
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:32,393
Why should I hold a grudge against you for something in a past life?

70
00:07:32,432 --> 00:07:39,804
After all, you're a different person now. You've come to me... with a new face.

71
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:46,296
Guess we'll be here awhile.

72
00:07:48,698 --> 00:07:53,037
Don't worry! Prince Zuko can't be getting too far in this weather.

73
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:57,518
I'm not worried they'll get away in the blizzard. I'm worried that they won't.

74
00:07:57,524 --> 00:07:59,164
They're not gonna die in this blizzard.

75
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:02,134
If we know anything it's that Zuko never gives up.

76
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:05,567
They'll survive... and we'll find them!

77
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:10,440
It's been a long time since I've added a child's face to my collection.

78
00:08:10,474 --> 00:08:13,682
So... how may I help you?

79
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,235
I need to find the Moon and the Ocean.

80
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:20,420
Their spirit names are Tui and La.

81
00:08:20,455 --> 00:08:27,688
Push... and Pull... and that has been the nature of their relationship for all time.

82
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:30,404
Please, help me find them.

83
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,966
An entire culture could be destroyed if I don't get their help.

84
00:08:33,984 --> 00:08:40,751
Oh, you think you need their help? Actually, it's quite the other way around.

85
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:43,673
Someone's going to kill them!

86
00:08:43,714 --> 00:08:47,208
What do you mean? How can I find them and protect them?

87
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:50,767
You've already met them, actually.

88
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:54,828
Tui and La, your Moon and Ocean,...

89
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:58,093
...have always circled each other in an eternal dance.

90
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:03,417
They balance each other... push and pull... life and death...

91
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:09,595
...good and evil... yin... and yang.

92
00:09:12,363 --> 00:09:14,384
The koi fish!

93
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:18,002
I must be going now.

94
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:20,752
We'll meet again.

95
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,638
The spirits are in trouble. I need to get back to the physical world.

96
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:32,332
A friend is here to guide you back.

97
00:09:32,377 --> 00:09:34,258
Hei-Bai!

98
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:27,830
We'll be following this map to a very special location.

99
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:32,487
And when we get there... we're going fishing.

100
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:39,571
This is where I came in. But how do I get back?

101
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:48,445
Good riddance.

102
00:10:52,755 --> 00:10:54,536
Momo!

103
00:10:54,558 --> 00:10:59,106
Momo? Oh no! Where's my body?

104
00:11:05,352 --> 00:11:09,922
Look! That's gotta be Aang! Yip! Yip!

105
00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:19,749
Welcome back.

106
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:21,786
Good to be back.

107
00:11:28,017 --> 00:11:31,002
That won't be enough to escape.

108
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,747
Appa!

109
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,806
Here for a rematch?

110
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:41,790
Trust me, Zuko, it's not going to be much of a match.

111
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:49,720
Hey! This is some quality rope!

112
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:54,173
We need to get to the oasis! The spirits are in trouble!

113
00:11:57,796 --> 00:12:00,653
Wait, we can't just leave him here.

114
00:12:00,694 --> 00:12:02,712
Sure we can. Let's go.

115
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:06,209
No, if we leave him, he'll die.

116
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:15,178
Yeh, this makes a lot of sense. Let's bring the guy who's constantly trying to kill us!

117
00:12:45,657 --> 00:12:46,899
Are you okay?

118
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,617
I feel faint.

119
00:12:48,658 --> 00:12:50,993
I feel it too.

120
00:12:51,711 --> 00:12:53,722
The Moon Spirit is in trouble.

121
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:56,190
I owe the Moon Spirit my life.

122
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,307
What do you mean?

123
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,438
When I was born I was very sick and very weak.

124
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:03,908
Most babies cry when they're born...

125
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:07,819
...but I was born as if I were asleep. My eyes closed.

126
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:10,945
Our healers did everything they could.

127
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,689
They told my mother and father I was going to die.

128
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:18,122
My father pleaded with the spirits to save me...

129
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:20,552
...that night, beneath the full moon,...

130
00:13:20,603 --> 00:13:24,197
...he brought me to the oasis and placed me in the pond.

131
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:29,601
My dark hair turned white, I opened my eyes and began to cry...

132
00:13:29,622 --> 00:13:32,473
...and they knew I would live.

133
00:13:32,482 --> 00:13:37,602
That's why my mother named me Yue, for the moon.

134
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:45,943
I am... a legend now! The Fire Nation will for generations tell stories about...

135
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,802
...the great Zhao who darkened the moon!

136
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:58,175
They will call me Zhao the Conqueror! Zhao the Moon Slayer! Zhao The Invincible!

137
00:13:58,202 --> 00:14:02,816
Huh! Get it off! Get if off!

138
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,601
Don't bother!

139
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:15,777
Zhao! Don't!

140
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:21,708
It's my destiny... to destroy the Moon... and the Water Tribe.

141
00:14:21,743 --> 00:14:25,514
Destroying the moon won't hurt just the Water Tribe.

142
00:14:25,538 --> 00:14:28,905
It will hurt everyone... including you.

143
00:14:28,944 --> 00:14:32,293
Without the moon, everything would fall out of balance.

144
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:36,413
You have no idea what kind of chaos that would unleash on the world.

145
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:38,247
He is right, Zhao!

146
00:14:38,263 --> 00:14:43,539
General Iroh, why am I not surprised to discover your treachery?

147
00:14:43,573 --> 00:14:47,740
I'm no traitor, Zhao, the Fire Nation needs the moon too.

148
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,297
We all depend on the balance.

149
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:59,882
Whatever you do to that spirit I'll unleash on you ten-fold! Let it go, now!

150
00:15:39,337 --> 00:15:44,410
There's no hope now. It's over.

151
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:48,660
No, it's not over.

152
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:04,760
You're alive?

153
00:17:04,787 --> 00:17:07,941
You tried to have me killed!

154
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:15,715
Yes, I did. You're the Blue Spirit... and enemy of the Fire Nation!

155
00:17:15,757 --> 00:17:17,821
You freed the Avatar!

156
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:20,119
I had no choice!

157
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:27,533
You should have chosen to accept your failure... your disgrace!

158
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:31,162
Then, at least you could have lived!

159
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:46,226
It's too late. It's dead.

160
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:53,758
You have been touched by the Moon Spirit. Some of its life is in you!

161
00:17:53,781 --> 00:18:01,991
Yes, you're right. It gave me life. Maybe I can give it back.

162
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,819
No! You don't have to do that!

163
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:06,590
It's my duty, Sokka.

164
00:18:06,605 --> 00:18:10,298
I won't let you! Your father told me to protect you!

165
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,665
I have to do this.

166
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:27,172
No!

167
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:32,163
She's gone. She's gone.

168
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:36,197
Goodbye, Sokka. I will always be with you.

169
00:20:14,426 --> 00:20:17,196
It can't be!

170
00:20:26,483 --> 00:20:28,724
Take my hand!

171
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:47,065
I've decided to go to the South Pole.

172
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,694
Some other benders and healers want to join me.

173
00:20:49,726 --> 00:20:52,966
It's time we helped rebuild our sister tribe.

174
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:56,415
What about Aang? He still needs to learn waterbending.

175
00:20:56,433 --> 00:21:02,628
Well, then he better get used to calling you "Master Katara."

176
00:21:03,598 --> 00:21:07,674
The Spirits gave me a vision when Yue was born.

177
00:21:07,714 --> 00:21:14,918
I saw... a beautiful, brave young woman... become the Moon Spirit.

178
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:16,693
I knew this day would come.

179
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,057
You must be proud.

180
00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:23,342
So proud. And sad.

181
00:21:24,198 --> 00:21:26,769
I'm surprised, Prince Zuko,...

182
00:21:26,814 --> 00:21:32,109
...surprised that you are not at this moment trying to capture the Avatar.

183
00:21:32,131 --> 00:21:33,479
I'm tired.

184
00:21:33,483 --> 00:21:39,696
Then you should rest. A man needs his rest.

185
00:21:56,022 --> 00:21:57,523
You too, Momo.

186
00:21:57,546 --> 00:21:59,444
Come here.

187
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:19,693
Iroh is a traitor and your brother Zuko is a failure. I have a task for you.

188
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:24,004
