<b>The Legend of Korra</b>

00:00:28,054 --> 00:00:29,635
A chance encounter turns Korra

00:00:29,648 --> 00:00:32,248
from pro-bending spectator
to pro-bending star!

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,540
With her new teammates,
Mako and Bolin,

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,253
the Fire Ferrets earn a place
in the championship tournament.

12
00:00:37,284 --> 00:00:40,928
But meanwhile, an anti-bending revolution
brews in Republic City.

13
00:00:40,947 --> 00:00:43,600
Who are the Equalists,
and what nefarious plan

14
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:47,302
does the mysterious man behind the mask
have in store for our hero?

17
00:00:58,876 --> 00:01:02,130
What's the big idea with making me train
this early in the morning?

18
00:01:02,164 --> 00:01:04,242
The morning is evil.

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,351
We're the rookies, so we get
the worst time spot in the gym.

20
00:01:07,378 --> 00:01:09,109
And you're the rookiest of us all.

21
00:01:09,127 --> 00:01:11,901
We gotta get you up to speed
if we want to survive in the tournament.

22
00:01:12,097 --> 00:01:13,697
Deal with it!

23
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:16,280
- You deal with it!
- Ooh! Oh...

24
00:01:17,572 --> 00:01:20,722
There are my little hard working
street urchins!

25
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:25,718
It's an honor to finally meet ya,
Avatar.

26
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,402
- And you are...?
- Butakha.

00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:31,226
I run this whole pro-bending shebang.

Here's your winnings
from the last match.

Ah, ah, ah!
Not so fast...

30
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:39,666
First you owe me
for the Avatar's new gear...

31
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:42,348
Gym and equipment rentals
for the last month...

32
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,768
Ah, ah!
Rent on your apartment...

33
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:47,778
Aa... and the personal loan,
for groceries.

34
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:51,728
What?
I'm a growing boy!

35
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:54,656
Oh, and one more
small item of business...

36
00:01:54,717 --> 00:01:56,533
The Fire Ferrets need to ante up

37
00:01:56,546 --> 00:01:59,411
30,000 yuans,
for the championship pot.

38
00:01:59,427 --> 00:02:01,243
30,000 yuans?!?

39
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,428
Sorry, kids.

40
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:06,083
You've got till the end of the week
to come up with the dough, or else...

41
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:07,495
You're out of the tournament.

44
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,262
I got nothing.

45
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:17,233
I've never really needed money.

46
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:19,193
I've always had people
taking care of me.

47
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:21,076
Then I wouldn't say
"you've had nothing".

48
00:02:21,597 --> 00:02:24,766
- Sorry I didn't mean...
- No, it's alright. It's just...

49
00:02:25,697 --> 00:02:28,781
Ever since we lost our parents,
we've been on our own.

50
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:31,324
I'm so sorry, I didn't know.

51
00:02:31,397 --> 00:02:32,978
So, anyway...

52
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,567
How are we gonna come up
with the money?

53
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:36,229
Oh, oh!
I got it! I got it!

54
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:38,432
I've been training Pabu
to do circus tricks...

55
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:40,948
Now, people would pay
good money to see that.

56
00:02:40,997 --> 00:02:43,896
Come on Bolin...
We need serious ideas.

57
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,506
I was serious...

58
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:48,356
Don't worry about it.
I'll figure something out.

59
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:49,889
I always do.

60
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:59,069
Come one, come all!

61
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:01,644
See Pabu,
the fantastic fire ferret,

62
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:04,335
as he crosses the ladder of peril...

63
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:07,133
Ooh!
Upside down!

64
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,247
Psst, psst!

65
00:03:12,536 --> 00:03:15,394
Big finish buddy.
Stick the landing!

66
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,492
Ta-da!

67
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,848
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen!

68
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,342
You are too kind.
Seriously, too kind!

69
00:03:22,357 --> 00:03:24,269
You can come back here
and put money right in this...

70
00:03:24,282 --> 00:03:25,766
Okay. That's fine.
That's fine.

71
00:03:25,844 --> 00:03:27,182
One yuan down...

72
00:03:27,194 --> 00:03:30,582
29,999 to go.

73
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,802
Hey, Bo-lin!
Is that you?

74
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,604
Oh... Hey there,
Shady Shin.

75
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:43,091
Heard you're a big time
pro-bending player now.

76
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,382
Not bad.

77
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:46,421
Uh... Thanks?

78
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,315
So listen...
I got an offer for you.

79
00:03:49,603 --> 00:03:53,830
Lightning Bolt Zolt is looking to hire
some extra muscle.

80
00:03:54,316 --> 00:03:56,635
Uh... I don't know, Shin

81
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:59,081
Mako told me
to stay away from the Triple Threats.

82
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:01,864
Pff! Your brother
ain't the boss of you!

83
00:04:01,995 --> 00:04:04,383
It's just a little security work.

84
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:06,058
Nothing crooked...

85
00:04:07,637 --> 00:04:11,100
<i>[Kiddie shows goofy onomatopoeias]</i>

86
00:04:11,332 --> 00:04:12,639
You game?

87
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:29,046
Bo'...! I'm back!

88
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,029
Picked up your favorite dumplings...!

89
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:35,312
Hey, I found some work
down at the power plant!

90
00:04:35,624 --> 00:04:37,103
Made some decent money.

91
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:40,017
Bolin?

92
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:41,826
You here, bro?

93
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:49,998
Huh...

94
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:52,351
I bet that little lovebird
is making a house call.

95
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:00,913
Good! Light on your feet!

96
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:06,516
Ooh, he's cute!

97
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,355
Korra, is that the handsome Fire bender boy
that drives you crazy?

98
00:05:10,374 --> 00:05:12,019
Does he drive you crazy
in a bad way?

99
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:14,731
Or does he drive you crazy
like you like him...

100
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:19,036
Oh! Hey, Mako.

101
00:05:19,293 --> 00:05:21,405
- You seen Bolin?
- Nice to see you, too.

102
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:24,332
And, no.
I haven't seen him since practice.

103
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,625
- Think something's wrong?
- I don't know...

104
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:29,995
Bolin has a knack
for getting into stupid situations.

105
00:05:30,231 --> 00:05:32,300
- Hm... See you later.
- Wait!

106
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:35,050
I could... help you look for him.

107
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:37,548
- Nah, I got it.
- Hey, "cool guy"...

108
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:40,060
Let me help you.
We can take Naga.

109
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:41,993
- Who's Naga?
- My best friend...

110
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:43,591
And a great tracker.

111
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:49,161
Your best friend is a...
polar bear-dog.

112
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:51,428
Somehow, that makes perfect sense.

113
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:53,760
I'll take that as a compliment,
city boy.

114
00:06:02,453 --> 00:06:04,903
Well, this is his usual hangout.

115
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:11,620
You guys seen my brother
around here today?

116
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,022
Perhaps...
My memory's a little...

117
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:15,294
Foggy.

118
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:17,764
Maybe you can help
clear it up.

119
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:19,228
You're good Skoochy...

120
00:06:19,835 --> 00:06:21,159
A real pro.

121
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:22,834
Yeah, I seen him.

122
00:06:22,852 --> 00:06:24,375
- When?
- 'Bout noon.

123
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,400
What was he doing?

124
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:28,281
He was performing some
kinda monkey-rat circus.

125
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:29,736
And then...

126
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:33,478
And then, what?
Why did he leave?

127
00:06:34,173 --> 00:06:37,160
Shady Shin showed up
and flashed some serious cash.

128
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,317
Bo took off with him
in his hot rod.

129
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,628
The Triple Threats,
the Red Monsoons,

130
00:06:41,657 --> 00:06:43,057
the Agni Kais...

131
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:45,669
All the triads are muscling up
for something real big.

132
00:06:45,692 --> 00:06:47,364
Now that's all you're getting
outta me!

133
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:52,470
- What's he talking about?
- Sounds like there's a turf war brewing.

134
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:55,637
And Bolin's about to get caught
right in the middle of it.

135
00:07:00,274 --> 00:07:03,163
- So where are we headed?
- The Triple Threat Triad's headquarters.

136
00:07:03,234 --> 00:07:05,474
Hopefully Bolin's there
and nothing's gone down yet.

137
00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:09,349
Triple Threat Triad? I beat up
some of those yahoos when I got into town.

138
00:07:09,368 --> 00:07:11,380
Why would Bolin
get tangled up with...

139
00:07:12,144 --> 00:07:13,403
Whoah, Naga!

140
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:21,876
- That's Pabu!
- No, Naga.

141
00:07:22,032 --> 00:07:24,060
Pabu's a friend,
not a snack.

142
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:30,729
We gotta hurry!

143
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:35,753
Something's not right.

144
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:37,708
There're usually thugs
posted out front.

145
00:07:37,742 --> 00:07:39,145
We better be cautious.

146
00:07:51,212 --> 00:07:53,281
Bolin, you in here?

147
00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:05,187
Bolin!

148
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:14,463
Naga, come!

149
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:00,946
I can't bend.

150
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:03,990
- I can't bend!
- Calm down.

151
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,777
It'll wear off.
Those guys were chi-blockers.

152
00:10:06,985 --> 00:10:09,121
- They're Amon's henchmen.
- Amon?

153
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:11,838
That anti-bending guy,
with the mask?

154
00:10:11,884 --> 00:10:14,249
Yeah. He's the leader
of the Equalists.

155
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,151
What do they want
with the Triple Threats?

156
00:10:16,244 --> 00:10:17,669
Whatever it is...

157
00:10:17,781 --> 00:10:19,000
Can't be good.

158
00:10:20,294 --> 00:10:22,812
I can't believe
Bolin got himself into this mess!

159
00:10:23,897 --> 00:10:27,042
Mako, we are going
to save your brother.

160
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,731
I promise you that.

161
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:44,557
We've been out all night.

162
00:10:45,006 --> 00:10:47,531
- No sign of him.
- We've gotta keep looking...

163
00:10:48,153 --> 00:10:49,390
But where?

164
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,607
I have an idea!

165
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:03,762
The first day
I got into town,

166
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:06,229
I ran into an Equalist protestor,
over there.

167
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:09,562
- You think they'll know where Bolin is?
- It's our only lead right now.

168
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:23,178
So, why is Bolin running around
with the Triple Threat Triad, anyway?

169
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:26,790
Well, we... we used to do
some work for them, back in the day.

170
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,447
What? Are you
some kind of criminal?

171
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:32,071
No! You don't know
what you're talking about.

172
00:11:32,378 --> 00:11:34,435
I just ran numbers for them
and stuff.

173
00:11:34,516 --> 00:11:36,222
We were orphans
out on the street!

174
00:11:36,223 --> 00:11:39,382
I did what I had to do to survive
and protect my little brother.

175
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:41,277
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:43,637
It must've been really hard.

177
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,475
Can I ask...

178
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:48,479
What happened to your parents?

179
00:11:50,736 --> 00:11:53,187
They were mugged,
by a fire bender.

180
00:11:53,353 --> 00:11:55,305
He cut them down
right in front of me.

181
00:11:55,822 --> 00:11:57,126
I was eight.

182
00:11:58,096 --> 00:11:59,317
Mako...

183
00:11:59,494 --> 00:12:01,636
Bolin's the only family
I have left.

184
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,182
If anything happened to him...

185
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,942
Equality now! Equality now!

186
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:15,327
We - want - equality - now!

187
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:18,095
I, uh...

188
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,150
Non-benders of Republic City!

189
00:12:20,245 --> 00:12:22,788
- That's the guy.
- Amon calls you to action!

190
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:24,685
Take back your city!

191
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,468
It's time for the...

192
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,810
It's you again!

193
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:32,573
You can not silence me,
Avatar!

194
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,070
Shut your yapper and listen up.

195
00:12:36,263 --> 00:12:39,110
My friend got kidnapped by some
chi-blockers. Where'd they take him?

196
00:12:39,204 --> 00:12:41,629
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

197
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:43,435
Oh, I think you do.

198
00:12:54,218 --> 00:12:57,684
"Witness the Revelation tonight,
9 o'clock."

199
00:12:57,975 --> 00:12:59,478
What's this "Revelation"?

200
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:02,210
Nothing that concerns
the likes of you two!

201
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:05,577
You better believe
it concerns us.

202
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:06,922
Spill it.

203
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:09,003
No one knows
what the Revelation is.

204
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:11,500
And I have no idea
what happened to your friend.

205
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:13,048
But, if he's a bender...

206
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:15,350
then my bet is, he's getting
what's coming to him!

207
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:16,894
Where's it happening?

208
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:20,335
Hey! What's going on
over there?

209
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:23,191
The Avatar's oppressing us!
Help!

210
00:13:23,704 --> 00:13:25,225
Let's scram.

211
00:13:31,552 --> 00:13:34,061
Why didn't the Equalists
put a location on these?

212
00:13:34,284 --> 00:13:37,841
Probably because they don't want just
anyone waltzing into their big "Revelation".

213
00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:39,331
Whatever that is...

214
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:42,354
I'll bet the information
is hidden on here, somehow.

215
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,798
Look at the backs.

216
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:45,389
There's four different images.

217
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,700
So... it's a puzzle?

218
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:50,872
Yeah... of a map!

219
00:13:58,651 --> 00:14:01,319
Bingo! That must be
where it's going down.

220
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,209
This is the place.

221
00:14:21,536 --> 00:14:24,493
- What are you doing?
- We'll attract less attention this way.

222
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:29,453
This is a private event.
No one gets in without an invitation.

223
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:31,961
Uh... invitation?

224
00:14:33,393 --> 00:14:35,341
You mean, this?

225
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:40,944
The Revelation is upon us,
my brother and sister.

226
00:14:47,398 --> 00:14:49,799
I knew
a lot of people hated benders,

227
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:52,184
but I've never seen so many
in one place.

228
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,645
Keep your eyes out for Bolin.

229
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:02,518
Please welcome your hero,

230
00:15:02,686 --> 00:15:04,749
your savior,

231
00:15:04,835 --> 00:15:07,791
Amon!

232
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:25,200
My quest for equality
began many years ago...

233
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:30,342
When I was a boy, my family and I
lived on a small farm.

234
00:15:30,445 --> 00:15:34,242
We weren't rich,
and none of us were benders.

235
00:15:34,404 --> 00:15:39,763
This made us very easy targets for
the Fire bender who extorted my father.

236
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:43,253
One day,
my father confronted this man.

237
00:15:43,762 --> 00:15:45,530
But when he did...

238
00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:49,209
That Fire bender
took my family from me.

239
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:52,397
Then... he took my face.

240
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:56,804
I've been forced to hide behind a mask
ever since.

241
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:03,678
As you know, the Avatar has
recently arrived in Republic City.

242
00:16:05,788 --> 00:16:08,718
And if she were here,
she would tell you

243
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:11,647
that bending brings balance
to the world.

244
00:16:11,794 --> 00:16:13,802
But, she is wrong.

245
00:16:13,814 --> 00:16:16,789
The only thing bending
has brought to the world

246
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:18,041
is suffering.

247
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,885
It has been the cause
of every war,

248
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:22,531
in every era.

249
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:25,566
But that
is about to change.

250
00:16:25,956 --> 00:16:28,192
I know you have been wondering,

251
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:30,628
"What is the Revelation?"

252
00:16:30,944 --> 00:16:33,973
You are about to get your answer.

253
00:16:35,568 --> 00:16:37,685
Since the beginning of time,

254
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:41,560
the Spirits have acted
as guardians of our world.

255
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:43,959
And they have spoken to me.

256
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:48,092
They say
the Avatar has failed humanity.

257
00:16:48,234 --> 00:16:52,161
That is why
the spirits have chosen me,

258
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:55,598
to usher in a new era of balance.

259
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:58,683
They have granted me a power

260
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:02,198
that will make equality a reality.

261
00:17:02,448 --> 00:17:06,769
The power to take
a person's bending away...

262
00:17:07,074 --> 00:17:08,460
Permanently.

263
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:12,878
That's impossible. There's no way...

264
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:14,552
This guy's insane...

265
00:17:14,574 --> 00:17:17,127
Now, for a demonstration.

266
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:20,638
Please welcome Lightning Bolt Zolt,

267
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:23,235
leader of the Triple Threat Triad,

268
00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:27,571
and one of the most notorious criminals
in Republic City.

269
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,583
Oh, boo yourself!

270
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,160
- There's Bolin.
- Wait!

271
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:41,102
We can't fight them all.
We need to be smart about this.

272
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:44,130
Then come up with a game plan,
team captain!

273
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:46,145
Zolt has amassed a fortune

274
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:49,294
by extorting and
abusing non-benders,

275
00:17:49,423 --> 00:17:53,685
but his reign of terror
is about to come to and end!

276
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,560
Now, in the interest of fairness,

277
00:17:56,587 --> 00:17:59,426
I will give Zolt the chance
to fight

278
00:17:59,427 --> 00:18:00,995
to keep his bending.

279
00:18:01,403 --> 00:18:03,646
You're gonna regret doing that,
pal!

280
00:18:37,795 --> 00:18:39,051
Wh...

281
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:40,648
What did you do to me?

282
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,233
Your Fire bending is gone.

283
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,825
Forever.

284
00:18:47,856 --> 00:18:51,152
The era of bending is over.

285
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:54,183
A new era, of equality,

286
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,781
has begun!

287
00:18:59,602 --> 00:19:00,988
No, ah!

288
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,853
Any ideas yet?

289
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:04,988
I think so.
See those machines?

290
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,736
They're powered by water and steam.

291
00:19:06,757 --> 00:19:09,843
If you create some cover,
I can grab Bolin without anyone seeing.

292
00:19:09,866 --> 00:19:12,123
- Then, we duck outta here.
- Works for me!

293
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:13,374
Mako...

294
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,263
- Good luck.
- You too.

295
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:29,350
It's not enough...

296
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:31,910
Hey, you!

297
00:19:43,087 --> 00:19:44,811
Is there a problem, my brother?

298
00:19:44,989 --> 00:19:46,730
What are you doing back here?

299
00:19:46,843 --> 00:19:49,991
Uh, looking for the bathroom?

300
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,974
Come on...

301
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:12,464
Thanks!
This should be enough.

302
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:26,072
Uh, hello, Amon, sir?

303
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:29,529
I think there's been
a big misunderstanding.

304
00:20:50,507 --> 00:20:52,926
- Bolin, you alright?
- Yes! Mako!

305
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,280
I love you!

306
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,797
You benders need to understand...

307
00:21:48,961 --> 00:21:52,211
There's no place in the world for you
anymore.

308
00:21:58,056 --> 00:22:00,120
I wouldn't count us out,
just yet.

309
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,704
Naga!

310
00:22:12,871 --> 00:22:15,683
Stop!
I want - to be - on - your back.

311
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,246
The Avatar! That's her!

312
00:22:19,802 --> 00:22:21,424
Let her go.

313
00:22:21,629 --> 00:22:25,128
She's the perfect messenger
to tell the city of my power.

314
00:22:33,137 --> 00:22:34,600
Thank goodness!

315
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:37,364
I was just about to send out
a search party. Are you alright?

316
00:22:38,282 --> 00:22:39,614
Uh-uh.

317
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,932
Korra? What happened?

318
00:22:42,457 --> 00:22:45,133
- Did you find your friend?
- Yes, but...

319
00:22:45,682 --> 00:22:47,562
I was at an Equalist rally.

320
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:49,518
- I saw Amon.
- What?

321
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,044
He can take people's bending away.

322
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,894
- For good.

00:22:58,372 --> 00:23:00,123

00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,361

00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:06,131
