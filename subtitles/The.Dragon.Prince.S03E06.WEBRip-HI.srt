[Viren] <i>Previously on</i> The Dragon Prince...

5
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,231
[Nyx] So, why did you save me?

6
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,608
Even after I tricked you and betrayed you?

7
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,279
- It's because Rayla is a hero.
- What?

8
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,699
Rayla is selfless, strong, and caring.

9
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:35,368
That's what makes her a hero.

10
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,121
That's what makes her Rayla.

11
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:46,504
I've spent years going along
with these creative solutions,

12
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,006
and where has it gotten me?

13
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,424
I don't understand.

14
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,760
I know you don't.

15
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,138
Viren, you are not above the law!

16
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:59,642
I'm afraid you have
misjudged the situation terribly.

17
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,648
I am the law.

18
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:11,321
All hail King Viren. All hail the king!

19

All hail the king!

- Whoa!
- [Zym growls]

26
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,079
So, what do we do from here?

27
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,166
[Nyx] Well, the dragon's lair
is only about a day's journey.

28
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,835
They call it the Storm Spire.

29
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:53,047
Big, tall, mountainy-tower thing,
pierces the clouds? You can't miss it.

[Callum grunts and exhales]

00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:11,190
So, uh, again, thanks for not killing me.

32
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,985
You know, for conning you,
and then betraying you,

33
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,571
stealing your dragon,
and leaving you stranded in the desert.

34

[laughs nervously]

35
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,825
No tip?

36
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,662
I suppose that's fair.

37
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,583
A word of advice, the air can get
pretty thin up there.

38
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,883
[laughs] Hey, looks like I gave you a tip!

39
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,344
- Guess we're even now.
- [Zym scoffs]

00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,849
[Nyx] Bye!

Phoe-Phoe, you've been flying all night.
You must be exhausted.

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,944
Are you sure
you don't want to stop and rest?

[horse whinnies]

47
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,433
[grunts] What, you don't want me
to smoosh that thing?

48
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:33,606
Do not smoosh the purple creature.
Think of it as my animal familiar.

49
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,735
So, you're saying
you've adopted a little bug-pal?

50
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:42,699
[sighs] Yes, Soren.
He is my little bug-pal.

51
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:48,121
I'll just ride back here
with Claudia for a while.

52
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:56,296
Has our relationship truly escalated
to this new height?

53
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,841
Am I your "little bug-pal"?

54
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,553
We have a long journey ahead.

55
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:08,057
While we travel, there is something
I have been meaning to ask you.

56
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:14,397
My understanding is that somehow
you killed Avizandum.

57
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,065
I've killed no such person.

58
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,651
Avizandum was no person.

59
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:24,073
Avizandum was an archdragon,
the great king of all the dragons.

60
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,326
The most powerful creature in the world.

61
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:30,496
Yet, somehow, you brought him down.

62
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:36,669
So, Avizandum was his true name.
We called him... Thunder.

63
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,504
[roars]

64
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,925
[Viren] <i>We encountered the great dragon
many years ago.</i>

65
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:49,140
<i>We had dared to enter Xadia
because we desperately needed something.</i>

66
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,190
<i>And in his fury to drive us out...</i>

67
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:09,619
<i>Thunder killed our queen,
the love of King Harrow's life, Sarai.</i>

68
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,667
<i>Many years passed
before I saw a chance to avenge her.</i>

69
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:24,592
...eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

70
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,969
Ready or not, here I come.

71
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:31,349
Now, where could
that clever little glow toad be hiding?

72
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,434
[giggling]

73
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,353
[Harrow] Hmm.

74
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,897
Bait's not back here.

75
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,191
I think I hear him.

76
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,276
[sniffs] I smell him.

77
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,612
I sense his grumpiness.

78
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,156
- He's close, I know it.
- [Ezran giggling]

79
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,538
[chuckles] I give up.
Bait is a hiding genius.

80
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,621
[Bait croaks]

81
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,833
- [laughs] Gotcha!
- [giggling]

82
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,584
[door opens]

83
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:03,256
[Harrow] Ah, Viren. Care to join
the next round of hide-and-seek?

84
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,258
No cheating with magic.

85
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,594
[chuckles] Uh-huh, perhaps next time.

86
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,431
High Mage Viren and I are going to talk.

87
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,559
Okay, Dad. Come on, Bait.

88
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,486
My king, an unusual opportunity
has presented itself.

89
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:30,533
We can avenge her, Harrow.
We can slay the King of the Dragons.

90
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,368
Are you crazy?

91
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,455
Thunder is bigger and stronger
than any beast the world has ever seen.

92
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:39,584
Entire armies have fallen and crumbled
like toys before him.

93
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,879
How can we hope to kill
such a godly creature?

94
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,590
I have discovered a powerful spell.

95
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:49,886
We can create
the ultimate weapon of vengeance.

96
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:59,145
On that fateful day, so many years ago,
Queen Sarai saved my life,

97
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,398
but minutes later, after Thunder struck,

98
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,110
there was nothing I could do to save hers.

99
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:10,698
I watched as her spirit
passed from the world.

100
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:11,949
Go on.

101
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,576
[Viren] <i>In her final moments,</i>

102
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:18,164
<i>I captured something
that I hoped we could use later.</i>

103
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,042
[Sarai gasping]

104
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,924
- It's empty.
- No.

105
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,927
It contains her dying breath.

106
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,220
[nervously] Viren...

107
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,890
You see, I knew about
a very ancient, powerful spell.

108
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:40,853
However, it requires something
impossibly rare, the horn of a unicorn.

109
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,481
I searched for years and I failed,

110
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:49,028
but a few days ago, my daughter Claudia
succeeded where I could not.

111
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,990
She captured a unicorn
and brought me its horn.

112
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,869
[sighs] Viren, what have you done?

113
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:01,374
Tell me you don't want justice.
Tell me she wasn't your world.

114
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,044
The dying breath. The unicorn's pure horn.

115
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,505
There's one last component I need.

116
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:11,634
The undying hatred
of one who loved the victim.

117
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,718
Your blood.

118
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:18,683
I know your heart still burns with anger.
Avenge her, Harrow!

119
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,446
[sighs]

120
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,991
It's been a long time.

121
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:40,746
Our kingdom is prospering. There is peace.
My boys, they're growing up.

122
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,874
Perhaps it's wiser
to stay focused on these blessings.

123
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,921
She didn't get to see the princes grow up.
She should have.

124
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,882
Yes, it's true.

125
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:56,637
And what about them?
They were robbed of their mother's love.

126
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,447
I do hate him.

127
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,754
[chanting]

128
00:10:57,114 --> 00:11:00,910
[exhales heavily] I will leave you
with your grief.

129
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,762
Hey, man. I'm Soren.
I don't think I caught your name.

130
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,224
Kasef. Prince Kasef.

131
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,267
Right, right.

132
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,145
Do I detect a little accent?

133
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,815
Ooh, let me guess.
You're from that one kingdom...

134
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,876
You know the...
you know the one I'm talking about.

135
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,610
Uh, uh, the...

136
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:35,693
Noodleoodlia.

137
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:41,117
[sighs] Neolandia.

138
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:45,663
[chuckles] Yeah.
That's exactly what I just said.

139
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,706
Noodleoodlia.

140
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,051
I can't believe it.

141
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,513
This is the moment
I've dreamed of my whole life!

142
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,598
We're going into Xadia!

143
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,724
[Bait croaks]

144

- [Phoe-Phoe panting]

145
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,148
Phoe-Phoe? What's wrong?

146
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,623
- Phoe-Phoe! You're exhausted and sick.
- [panting]

147
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,379
You got us to Xadia.
We can find them on our own now.

148
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,924
You need to go home
so you can rest and get better.

[Phoe-Phoe chirping]

150
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:44,430
I know Lujanne told you
to bring me all the way,

151
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,891
but you have to promise me you'll be okay.

152
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,976
[coos softly]

153
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,022
She says she has to see this through.

154
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,580
[sniffs] Ugh.

155
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:16,337
Your brother, Soren, he's a bit... quirky.

156
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,882
Hmm. People usually say
I'm the quirky one.

157
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,092
[exclaims]

158
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:33,103
And your father, is he talking to himself?

159
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,857
What? No, of course
he's not talking to himself.

160
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:37,942
That'd be crazy!

161
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,403
He's talking to his little bug-pal.

162
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:46,867
Uh-huh.

163
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:58,087
[Aaravos] Please, continue.
I eagerly await the great confrontation.

164
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:05,052
We did not find Thunder... Avizandum...
where we expected to find him.

165
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,643
Where is he?

166
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,187
He's always guarded this border jealously.

167
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,523
But today, when we've come for him,
he hides?

168
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,607
No.

169
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,194
If he's not protecting the border,

170
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,281
it's because he's protecting something
more important.

Here he comes.

177
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:15,497
Leave.
Today, of all days, I will spare you.

178
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:21,211
But you must turn around
and leave Xadia. Now.

179
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,839
No.

180
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:29,428
Today is a special day, a day of life.

181
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:35,142
Do not force me to make it a day of death.

182
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:40,773
This is your last chance. Leave or die!

183
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,319
You never gave her that choice.

No, it's not.

What do you mean?

202
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,861
The reason he was here
and not at the border.

203
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,364
He was protecting something very precious.

204
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,326
His egg!

205
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,619
His mate must be gone.

206
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,080
That's why Thunder
was willing to spare us.

207
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,873
He needed to get back to that egg!

208
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,417
So what? Why does that matter?

209
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,880
- We must destroy it.
- What?

210
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,050
- No.
- We have no choice, Harrow.

211
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:17,096
Don't you see? If that egg hatches,
all of us will be in terrible danger.

From a baby dragon?

After what we have done,
his name will be "vengeance"!

His destiny will be
the destruction of humanity.

Give me one chance to clean this up.

And then it will truly, finally be over.

I am delighted you took down
that arrogant monster.

It sounds like you have
a history with Avizandum.

[Aaravos] Oh, I do.

[Viren] And where is that?

237
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:08,624
[scoffs] He never bothered to mention
where he imprisoned me.

You're imprisoned?

239
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,670
[scoffs] Your home looks like no prison
I've ever seen.

00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:17,174
Yes, it's well appointed.

241
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,675
But make no mistake,

242
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,095
this has been my prison
these past few centuries.

243
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,806
King Viren, I have some bad news.

244
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,893
We've received word that the Breach
has been completely destroyed.

245
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,771
- What?
- Without the Breach to cross into Xadia,

246
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,315
our armies are stranded on the human side.

247
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,567
The border is completely impassable.

248
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,904
We're going to cross that border.

After all...

250
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,992
impassable is just
another kind of passable.

Ezran, what are you doing here?

Let's just say that being king
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,901
Are you okay? Are you hurt?
Let me look at you.

Oh, no. She flew the whole way here.

She's so tired,
but she wouldn't let me stop her.

and now we made it.

Oh...

283

Looking at him, seeing him...

284
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,202
It makes me sad, and angry, and...

285
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,621
confused.

286
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:20,083
Of course it does. It's painful.

287
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,752
How could you feel any different?

288
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,462
See that spear?

289
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,840
That was her spear, my mom's.

290
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:30,135
And my stepdad put it into his heart.

291

How am I supposed to feel about that?

[Rayla] I don't know, Callum.

293

Glad?

294

Happy that we got revenge?

295
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,901
Or maybe regretful...

296
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,320
and sad, because...

297
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,238
Because what?

298
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,742
Because that was Zym's dad.

Me too, Callum.

302

But look at them, playing together.

That's the miracle. That's hope.
