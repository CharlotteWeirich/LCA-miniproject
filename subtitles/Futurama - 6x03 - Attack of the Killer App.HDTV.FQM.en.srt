As mayor, it is my deeply
tedious pleasure to kick off

00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:35,918
Sorry. I get
aroused in crowds.

8
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:39,489
I will now throw out
the ceremonial first dump--

9
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:42,892
this old, inefficient
vote rigger!

These old doomsday devices
are dangerously unstable.

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,702

So long, overly complicated
Japanese toilet.

16
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,076
TOILET:
Please not to throw away.

17
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,844
I give you happy poopie time.

18

25

Us bending units

28
00:01:25,202 --> 00:01:26,702
No one. Your mama.

29
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,137
Shut up.

30

Mr. Mayor,
isn't this e-waste dangerous?

35
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:39,248
Not at all, Scoop.

36
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:41,484
Not after it's hauled off
to the Third World

It shan't take long

42

to strip down
your clunker.

43

There's nothing wrong
with our clunker.

44
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:18,588
Really? Because we can smelt out
the deadly, deadly chromium

45
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:21,557
to make rat poison
and artificial sweeteners.

46
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,626
No, thanks.
We're delivering e-waste.

47
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:25,595
Pity. We're
halfway done.

48
00:02:25,662 --> 00:02:27,697
(blowtorch hissing)

49
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:31,067

40% chromium!

Gentle now.

53
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:37,507
Gentle with
the hoverdumpster.

54
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,443
Ready for processing!

What smells like bloody sinuses?

57
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,653
We burn your e-waste down
to the usable metals,

58
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:53,756
safely releasing the
toxins into our air

59
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,458
and drinking water.

Ugh! That's the worst thing
I've ever seen!

62
00:02:59,463 --> 00:03:01,397
Really? Then don't
look over there.

63
00:03:01,465 --> 00:03:02,798
(laughter)

64
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:04,200
Okay, kids.

65
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:06,435
Let's play find
the shiny!

66
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:08,804

That's even
more horrific!

69
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:15,878
Is all the
work done
by children?

70
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,713
No, not the whipping.

71
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,715
(whip cracking)

72
00:03:22,252 --> 00:03:25,688
Granted, we later learned some
positive things about recycling,

73
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:28,457
but a better solution is
to use our electronics

74
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:31,093
as long as possible
instead of throwing them out

75

in the first place.

76
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,764
I'm gonna start
by keeping my old cell phone,

77
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:36,132
even if it is outdated.

80
00:03:40,204 --> 00:03:42,872
Well, let's at least
throw this TV out.

81
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,474
The batteries
in the remote are getting low.

82
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:48,044
No! Put that back
and turn it on!

83

There may be one.

no choice of carrier,

Twitcher lets you send

149
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,959

Nowadays, cool kids like me
mash up our own phone-isodes.

00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:10,839
It's from the

171

My nephew is alive!

172
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:14,676
And he's... in
this envelope.

173
00:07:14,744 --> 00:07:17,879

It's a phone call, dingus.

181

These eyePhones are phones, too?

182
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:34,396
Duh.

183
00:07:34,463 --> 00:07:36,765
Fry-lo.
LEELA: Hi, Fry.

184
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:39,501
Did you know
these eyePhones are phones, too?

185
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:42,237
Duh. Hey, is it safe
to talk while you're flying?

186
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:44,973
Oh, totally.
This thing's hands-free.

187
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,942
That's how I can eat this taco.
And this spaghetti.

188
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,478

Ow!

193
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:00,989
You recorded that?

194
00:08:01,057 --> 00:08:02,691
The eyePhone records everything.

195
00:08:02,758 --> 00:08:04,659
All I did was add a laugh track

196
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:06,561
and twit it

It's exactly the right
amount of information!

210
00:08:30,186 --> 00:08:31,586
For years,
I've collected personao data

Why is Mr. Chunks
doing that?

269
