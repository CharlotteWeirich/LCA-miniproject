her and her father,</i>

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,667

12

18
00:00:55,428 --> 00:00:59,564
Welcome home, Avatar.
Thanks for starting a war.

19
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:01,566
I didn't start a war.

20
00:01:01,568 --> 00:01:04,669
Well, I did, but it's more complicated

21
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:05,703
Than you're making it seem.

22
00:01:05,705 --> 00:01:07,205
Mako, I want you back on the beat.

23
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:10,008
There's going to be a southern
water tribe peace March tonight.

24
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,378
I need you there to make sure
things don't get out of hand.

25
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,747
- I'm all yours.
- I'll go too.

26
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:18,550
The people of the south need to see
that the avatar is on their side...

27
00:01:18,552 --> 00:01:20,618
In the fight against the northern invaders.

28
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,788
Great.
That should calm them down.

29
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,557
- Maybe you should sit this out.
- What?

30
00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:28,660
I just think having you there
blatantly supporting one side

31
00:01:28,662 --> 00:01:29,594
Will only make things worse.

32
00:01:29,596 --> 00:01:31,329
You could at least
try to seem neutral.

33
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:34,799
I'm not neutral.
The north invaded my home.

34
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:35,533
The only reason I'm here

35
00:01:35,535 --> 00:01:38,870
Is to get the republic to send
troops to help the south.

36
00:01:38,872 --> 00:01:41,973
Zhu li's already scheduled a meeting
for us with President Raiko tomorrow.

37
00:01:41,975 --> 00:01:43,241
We'll get him on board.

38
00:01:43,243 --> 00:01:45,276
Whatever.
I gotta go to work.

39
00:01:45,278 --> 00:01:46,511
I better go check on my factory.

40
00:01:46,513 --> 00:01:48,646
I'm going to find out
about this peace March.

41
00:01:48,648 --> 00:01:52,383
And I am dying
for a pedicure!

42
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,322
So, uh, what should I be doing?

43
00:01:57,324 --> 00:01:58,957
I don't know, Bolin.

44
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,693
Figure something out.

45
00:02:01,695 --> 00:02:05,530
Say, kid, have you ever seen
Republic City at night?

46
00:02:05,532 --> 00:02:07,465
Sure, I live here.

47
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:09,801
Have you <i>really</i> seen it?

48
00:02:09,803 --> 00:02:10,602
Y--
No?

49
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:14,038
That's what I thought.

50
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,141
Come on.

51
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:18,576
Tonraq and the rebels are holed up here

52
00:02:18,578 --> 00:02:20,845
In the hills
outside of town.

53
00:02:20,847 --> 00:02:21,412
Leave them.

54
00:02:21,414 --> 00:02:23,081
My brother's no threat to us up there.

55
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,483
Increase security around the spirit portal.

56
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:28,620
Keeping it safe is our number one priority.

57
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:31,022
Yes, sir.

58
00:02:39,632 --> 00:02:41,833
I need you two to go after the avatar.

59
00:02:41,835 --> 00:02:45,470
She's the only one who can open
the northern spirit portal.

60
00:02:45,472 --> 00:02:47,939
But, father, you told korra--

61
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:50,441
I told korra what I thought she needed to hear.

62
00:02:50,443 --> 00:02:54,212
I'll find her.
She stole my husband.

63
00:02:54,214 --> 00:02:56,447
I need her alive.

64
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:59,050
Fine.

65
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:05,857
Watch me, Poki.

66
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:09,227
You lay down and roll over.

67
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:10,995
Roll over.

68
00:03:10,997 --> 00:03:14,199
No, no, you can't
just demonstrate it.

69
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:15,466
That never works.

70
00:03:18,805 --> 00:03:21,539
Good.

71
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:24,943
Ugh, Classic over-rewarding.

72
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:31,783
- Poki, where are you going?
- Command respect.

73
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:35,820
Having some trouble, son?

74
00:03:35,822 --> 00:03:38,156
Poki isn't very good at learning.

75
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,092
Believe me, I know the feeling.

76
00:03:41,094 --> 00:03:42,293
Maybe I can help.

77
00:03:42,295 --> 00:03:43,561
How would you like your old dad.

78
00:03:43,563 --> 00:03:46,130
To teach you how to be a master trainer?

79
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:47,999
Yeah!

80
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:04,649
<i>Tensions are running high outside of the
southern water tribe cultural center.</i>

81
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:06,784
<i>The avatar is leading
a group of southerners</i>

82
00:04:06,786 --> 00:04:09,854
<i>In a peaceful protest
against chief unalaq,</i>

83
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:14,058
<i>But the northerners have come out in
droves in support of their leader.</i>

84
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,027
Boo!

85
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,762
Get out of here!

86
00:04:17,764 --> 00:04:21,099
- Boo!
- Get a real job!

87
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:24,936
- Get out of here!
- You stink!

88
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:39,717
Hey!
Stop!

89
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:42,620
Republic City Police.

90
00:05:32,504 --> 00:05:34,906
The northern water tribe
is out of control.

91
00:05:34,908 --> 00:05:38,042
I saw a firebender running away from the blast.

92
00:05:38,044 --> 00:05:40,078
The north might not be
responsible for this.

93
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,113
Of course they're responsible.

94
00:05:42,115 --> 00:05:45,683
Who else would it be?

95
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:04,135
Wow. Usually, When I see
flashing lights like this,

96
00:06:04,137 --> 00:06:06,604
It's because I got hit
in the head with a rock.

97
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:12,377
Being famous is like getting
hit with a rock all the time.

98
00:06:15,114 --> 00:06:17,682
Look!
It's bolin!

99
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:20,985
Bolin! Bolin! Bolin!

100
00:06:20,987 --> 00:06:25,022
Bolin! Bolin!
Bolin! Bolin!

101
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:26,124
Folks, that cheer you're hearing

102
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:28,593
Is for local favorite, bolin, of the fire ferrets.

103
00:06:28,595 --> 00:06:31,529
Let's see
if we can get a quick interview.

104
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:33,164
Bolin!

105
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,366
Bolin, the fire ferrets
are out for the season.

106
00:06:35,368 --> 00:06:37,068
How have you been spending
your time lately?

107
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,705
Well, I took a trip south for
the glacier spirits festival,

108
00:06:40,707 --> 00:06:42,373
Was briefly engaged to a princess,

109
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,276
Then went through kind of
a tough breakup there,

110
00:06:45,278 --> 00:06:49,280
Was accidentally involved
in a civil war...

111
00:06:51,017 --> 00:06:53,217
But there's nowhere I'd rather be

112
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:55,787
Than pro bending night
in Republic City!

113
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:57,155
Am I right, people?

114
00:06:57,157 --> 00:06:59,257
Republic City!

115
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:03,928
Do you miss being in the ring?

116
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,731
Well, I definitely don't miss getting
hit with things all the time

117
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:08,466
And the humiliating losing.

118
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:09,367
I mean,
that gets pretty old.

119
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:13,171
You know, sometimes I actually
cry myself to sleep...

120
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,642
I guess what I miss the
most are these fans!

121
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:19,577
They're the greatest fans
in the world!

122
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:24,081
Give it up for the fans!

123
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,384
Look how these people love you, kid.

124
00:07:26,386 --> 00:07:29,420
They're eating that cornball
spiel right out of your hand.

125
00:07:29,422 --> 00:07:31,923
The trick is, whenever I get confused,

126
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:34,992
I just say "Republic City" or "fans,"

127
00:07:34,994 --> 00:07:36,127
And then everyone cheers.

128
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:40,565
I think I just figured out
your true calling.

129
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:45,636
I hope President Raiko
listens to us.

130
00:07:45,638 --> 00:07:46,504
Don't worry.

131
00:07:46,506 --> 00:07:49,640
I was a big contributor
to his election campaign.

132
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:54,612
Him and the other guy.
Gotta hedge your bets.

133
00:07:56,048 --> 00:07:59,116
Hello, Mr. President.

134
00:07:59,118 --> 00:08:01,852
Sir, the southern water tribe--

135
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:03,120
Just a second.

136
00:08:03,122 --> 00:08:06,657
Keep smiling.

137
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:12,096
Now, how can I help the avatar
and my most generous supporter?

138
00:08:12,098 --> 00:08:14,532
Unalaq's troops have invaded the south.

139
00:08:14,534 --> 00:08:16,734
We need you to send
the united forces to help.

140
00:08:16,736 --> 00:08:19,470
I'm very concerned by what's
happening down there,

141
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:21,472
But I don't think it's the Republic's place

142
00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:23,240
To interfere with internal
water tribe matters.

143
00:08:23,242 --> 00:08:26,711
Unalaq isn't even the rightful
ruler of the water tribe.

144
00:08:26,713 --> 00:08:29,780
He lied his way onto the northern throne.

145
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:30,381
Mr. President,

146
00:08:30,383 --> 00:08:32,783
The republic is already
involved in this conflict.

147
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:35,219
The north attacked
our cultural center last night.

148
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:37,855
Believe me, we are doing
everything we can

149
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:40,424
To bring the people responsible to justice.

150
00:08:40,426 --> 00:08:41,726
"The people responsible"?

151
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:43,928
Who else would it be
but the northerners?

152
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,529
Now, I know that when you're young,

153
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:46,997
It's hard to keep perspective--

154
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:48,799
You're the one who's lost perspective.

155
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:51,802
I'm trying to save my tribe,
and you're taking pictures.

156
00:08:51,804 --> 00:08:54,839
Sending troops is not something
I can do at this time,

157
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:59,176
But I promise I will work with unalaq and
the south for a diplomatic solution.

158
00:08:59,178 --> 00:09:02,079
Now, I'm sorry,
but my mind is made up.

159
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:03,080
This meeting is over.

160
00:09:03,082 --> 00:09:05,616
My family is going to be wiped out,

161
00:09:05,618 --> 00:09:11,255
And it'll be on your head
for doing nothing about it.

162
00:09:14,493 --> 00:09:16,828
I can't believe the president is doing nothing.

163
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,662
He--he doesn't even care.

164
00:09:17,664 --> 00:09:20,365
I'm sure he cares, but he
can't just tell his people

165
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:22,033
To go fight a battle
at the south pole

166
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:23,268
That has nothing
to do with them.

167
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,936
How could you take his side?

168
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:26,371
What's with you and sides?

169
00:09:26,373 --> 00:09:28,573
Why do you always think
I'm working against you?

170
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,408
Well, you're not helping me.

171
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,244
I'm trying to get troops
to the south.

172
00:09:32,246 --> 00:09:33,445
What are you doing?

173
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,913
I'm doing my job.

174
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:37,148
Well, excuse me, officer.

175
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,085
Don't let me stand in the way
of you writing tickets.

176
00:09:40,087 --> 00:09:41,219
I'm just trying
to save the world.

177
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:43,722
Well, you wouldn't have to if
you didn't keep messing it up.

178
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:46,024
I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

179
00:09:48,996 --> 00:09:52,130
You're the one
who's like this!

180
00:09:56,904 --> 00:09:58,003
Hey, in a hurry?

181
00:09:58,005 --> 00:10:00,038
Sorry, I have to talk to Varrick.

182
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,441
Yeah, me too.

183
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:10,181
Oh, Hello.

184
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:12,117
See?
I told you I could do it.

185
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:13,952
Sorry I ever doubted you.

186
00:10:13,954 --> 00:10:17,622
We can't wait for the president to act.
We need those troops now.

187
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:19,357
And my company is about to go under.

188
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:21,660
I have to find a way
to make some sales.

189
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,762
Right. Okay.
Got it.

190
00:10:23,764 --> 00:10:25,196
Idea storm.

191
00:10:25,198 --> 00:10:27,032
Get the supplies.

192
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:29,134
You're about to get
an inside look

193
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:30,635
At how varrick global industries

194
00:10:30,637 --> 00:10:36,875
Stays at the forefront of imagination
innovation or "imagivation"!

195
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:40,211
That's trademarked, pal.

196
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:44,849
Brain work requires
increased circulation.

197
00:10:47,219 --> 00:10:50,455
Let's do this!

198
00:10:51,123 --> 00:10:55,560
Okay, here come the
ideas, fast and furious.

199
00:10:55,562 --> 00:10:59,030
Pink mint lemon tea.

200
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:04,769
Radio for pets.
Uh, hand shoes.

201
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:05,370
Hold on a tic.

202
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:07,939
We don't need the president
to go to the south.

203
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:11,042
We just need the troops.
Let's go straight to them.

204
00:11:11,044 --> 00:11:13,345
If there's one thing
I know about troops,

205
00:11:13,347 --> 00:11:14,779
It's that they love fighting.

206
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:17,782
I know General Iroh.
He might be willing to help us.

207
00:11:17,784 --> 00:11:20,185
A man on the inside.
Perfect.

208
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:22,654
And you need to sell
some mecha-tanks.

209
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:25,056
I know some people
who need them.

210
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:26,825
We'll ship 'em south.

211
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:27,525
That's perfect.

212
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:29,060
You'll be making money
for your company,

213
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:31,396
And you'll be helping
to defeat unalaq.

214
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:32,030
It's true.

215
00:11:32,032 --> 00:11:33,832
If you can't make money
during a war,

216
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:35,834
You just flat-out
cannot make money.

217
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:38,370
It's dangerous on
the seas right now,

218
00:11:38,372 --> 00:11:40,905
But I'm willing
to try if you are.

219
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:46,111
It'll be crazy risky,
But I love crazy risky!

220
00:11:46,113 --> 00:11:48,713
End storm!

221
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,953
Zhu li, get those other ideas
to research and development.

222
00:11:54,955 --> 00:11:56,855
I want prototypes
by next week.

223
00:11:56,857 --> 00:11:59,324
I don't understand
why it's so hard

224
00:11:59,326 --> 00:12:01,059
To get republic city
to support the south.

225
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:04,295
Don't worry.
I'm already working on that.

226
00:12:04,297 --> 00:12:05,930
As soon as people see this,

227
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:08,500
They'll be lining up
to fight unalaq.

228
00:12:08,502 --> 00:12:11,803
Zhu li, do the, uh--
the thing.

229
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:13,505
Don't freak out.
It's not real.

230
00:12:13,507 --> 00:12:18,943
I had a film crew documenting
the entire northern invasion.

231
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,682
Sorry. I keep doing that.

232
00:12:24,684 --> 00:12:26,284
We're gonna cut
this footage together

233
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:29,220
With scenes we shoot
of our superstar bolin here

234
00:12:29,222 --> 00:12:31,923
Playing
a southern water tribe hero

235
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:33,324
Battling the evil unalaq.

236
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:35,460
No one will root
for the north after they see

237
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:40,932
<i>The adventures of nuktuk:
Hero of the south!</i>

238
00:12:41,434 --> 00:12:42,434
I'm nuktuk!

239
00:12:42,436 --> 00:12:45,203
What do you think?

240
00:12:47,908 --> 00:12:51,409
Oh, man, you should
have seen varrick today.

241
00:12:51,411 --> 00:12:53,311
That guy is a genius.
- Uh-huh.

242
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:55,980
He's gonna help asami sell
her mecha-tanks to the south,

243
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:58,450
And he came up
with this great idea for korra

244
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:00,585
To get general iroh
to fight unalaq

245
00:13:00,587 --> 00:13:03,788
Without president raiko
ever even knowing.

246
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,923
What?
That's a terrible idea.

247
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:06,891
And he's gonna
put me in the movers

248
00:13:06,893 --> 00:13:07,792
As this hero, Nuktuk.

249
00:13:07,794 --> 00:13:11,663
He's a man of action,
but he's got a heart of gold.

250
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,298
He was born in the tundra.

251
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,732
Look, I'm trying
to do something

252
00:13:14,734 --> 00:13:15,900
That's actually important here.

253
00:13:15,902 --> 00:13:18,203
Oh.
Oh, sorry.

254
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:19,537
Uh, sure.
What is it?

255
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:22,440
Something doesn't make
sense about this bombing.

256
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:24,909
I just don't buy
that the northern water tribe

257
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:26,344
Was behind it.

258
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:28,413
Wait a second!
That's him!

259
00:13:28,415 --> 00:13:30,815
That's the guy
that attacked the center.

260
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:33,017
I gotta go show this
to beifong.

261
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:34,619
Glad I could help.

262
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:37,589
Nuktuk saves the day again!

263
00:13:39,392 --> 00:13:40,058
All right, meelo.

264
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,594
The first thing
you need to do as a trainer

265
00:13:42,596 --> 00:13:44,062
Is establish dominance.

266
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:47,398
You are in charge.
Never forget that.

267
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,800
Now call poki.

268
00:13:48,802 --> 00:13:51,236
Poki, come here.

269
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:54,272
Poki.

270
00:13:55,742 --> 00:13:57,609
- Poki, no.
- Meelo.

271
00:13:57,611 --> 00:14:00,945
You're rewarding him
for bad behavior.

272
00:14:00,947 --> 00:14:03,781
But he's tickling me.

273
00:14:09,488 --> 00:14:12,857
You can't let him nap in the bed with you.

274
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:14,792
You are the alpha lemur.

275
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:16,461
He has to sleep
on the floor.

276
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:23,601
I know it's hard,
but it's for the best.

277
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:26,604
No, poki.
This is my bed.

278
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:28,907
You sleep on the floor.

279
00:14:31,478 --> 00:14:42,220
- Being alpha lemur is lonely.
- I know.

280
00:14:43,255 --> 00:14:45,957
How did this cultural center attack
happen right under your nose?

281
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,260
And why haven't you arrested
the northerners responsible?

282
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:51,996
- We're working on it, sir.
- Well, work harder.

283
00:14:51,998 --> 00:14:53,164
If you don't get any results soon,

284
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,700
I'm going
to find someone who can.

285
00:14:55,702 --> 00:14:57,168
I got a break in the bombing case.

286
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,938
I I.D.'d the guy
I saw at the scene.

287
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,776
- That's great, mako.
- Yeah, you better run that in to beifong right now.

288
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:09,214
- You think?
- Sure. You're gonna be a hero.

289
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:17,855
<i>What makes a rookie beat cop think he can
interrupt my meeting with the president?</i>

290
00:15:17,857 --> 00:15:18,856
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

291
00:15:18,858 --> 00:15:21,559
<i>I just--um, I found something
out about the bombing.</i>

292
00:15:21,561 --> 00:15:24,128
<i>Well, give it to lu and gang, you moron.</i>

293
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,130
<i>Now get out!</i>

294
00:15:26,132 --> 00:15:28,399
Sorry. Was she busy?

295
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:29,067
This is the guy I saw

296
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:31,536
Sneaking out of the building
right before the explosions.

297
00:15:31,538 --> 00:15:33,738
He's a member
of the agni kais.

298
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,440
Someone must have hired him
to make it look

299
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:39,377
Like northerners attacked
the cultural center.

300
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:40,979
Hmm.

301
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:45,316
Did you learn anything
about that remote control

302
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:46,451
I found at the scene?

303
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:48,519
That's gotta be the key to finding
out who's really responsible.

304
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:51,589
Listen, kid, it was the
northern water tribe, okay?

305
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:55,426
Yeah, give it a rest, super cop.

306
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:04,102
I've heard good things about you.

307
00:16:04,104 --> 00:16:07,071
You've made some big triad busts
for a rookie.

308
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:07,705
Thank you, sir.

309
00:16:07,707 --> 00:16:10,541
- And you're dating the Avatar, right?
- Yes, sir.

310
00:16:10,543 --> 00:16:14,312
I'm concerned that she might be
getting some bad advice from Varrick.

311
00:16:14,314 --> 00:16:17,749
You wouldn't happen to know
if they're plotting anything

312
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:21,319
That might compromise
the security of Republic City,

313
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:23,187
Would you, officer?

314
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:26,958
Let me remind you
that you've sworn an oath.

315
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,494
You're a man of the law
before anything else.

316
00:16:29,496 --> 00:16:30,862
Yes, sir.

317
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:34,632
Well, keep up the good work.

318
00:16:38,471 --> 00:16:38,903
Wait.

319
00:16:38,905 --> 00:16:43,341
There's something
you should know.

320
00:16:45,912 --> 00:16:48,514
<i>Thank you for seeing me, General Iroh.</i>

321
00:16:48,516 --> 00:16:51,283
- What can I do?
- The south needs military support

322
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:53,285
Before Unalaq wipes them out completely,

323
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:56,321
But the president is refusing
to give the order.

324
00:16:56,323 --> 00:16:59,558
- So I decided to come to you directly.
- I see.

325
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,361
Well, suppose I were
to take the fleet south

326
00:17:02,363 --> 00:17:04,463
On some routine
training maneuvers.

327
00:17:04,465 --> 00:17:08,200
And let's say we were to accidentally
run into a hostile northern blockade.

328
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:11,603
We'd have no choice but to
defend ourselves, wouldn't we?

329
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:14,540
I guess you wouldn't.
Thank you.

330
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:17,376
- Swapping old war stories?
- Mr. President.

331
00:17:17,378 --> 00:17:19,845
I hope you're not planning
to take any military action

332
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:22,614
Without an order
from your commander in chief.

333
00:17:22,616 --> 00:17:25,717
- Of course not, sir.
- Good, because if a single vessel

334
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:29,455
Leaves this harbor without my
say-so, You'll be court-martialed.

335
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:31,356
- Am I clear?
- Crystal, sir.

336
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:33,892
Your activities here are
bordering on insurrection.

337
00:17:33,894 --> 00:17:37,362
The Avatar does not command
the military of the Republic.

338
00:17:37,364 --> 00:17:39,531
Don't go behind my back again.

339
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:44,002
As you were, General Iroh.

340
00:17:45,505 --> 00:17:50,142
- I hate that guy!
- I'm sorry. My hands are officially tied.

341
00:17:50,144 --> 00:17:52,911
I understand.
Thanks anyway.

342
00:17:52,913 --> 00:17:54,980
But you should talk to the fire lord.

343
00:17:54,982 --> 00:17:57,683
My mother and grandfather
have always been good friends

344
00:17:57,685 --> 00:18:00,285
To the Avatar and the southern water tribe.

345
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,087
I'm sure, they'll be willing to help.

346
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:04,323
Thank you, General.

347
00:18:07,061 --> 00:18:10,095
Wouldn't I be cold wearing this outfit in the snow?

348
00:18:10,097 --> 00:18:12,598
Ah, Nuktuk is never cold.

349
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,666
Ooh.

350
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:17,069
Hey, ginger.

351
00:18:18,404 --> 00:18:19,104
How about that, huh?

352
00:18:19,106 --> 00:18:22,841
It's the latest product in
my varri-manageable hair line:

353
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:23,575
Varri-dye!

354
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:25,177
We get some shots
of her using it

355
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:26,311
Before unalaq kidnaps her,

356
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:29,915
I guarantee we sell
a million cases week one.

357
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:32,050
Bolin, I need you to watch
naga while I'm gone.

358
00:18:32,052 --> 00:18:34,520
- Where you going?
- The Fire nation.

359
00:18:34,522 --> 00:18:37,155
I'm going to try to get
them to help the south.

360
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:37,823
I need a boat.

361
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,124
What happened
with general iroh?

362
00:18:39,126 --> 00:18:42,528
He was going to help, but then
President Raiko showed up.

363
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,029
Someone must
have tipped him off,

364
00:18:44,031 --> 00:18:45,097
But I can't figure it out.

365
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:47,766
No one knew about it
except for us and Asami.

366
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:50,435
- And mako.
- Mako?

367
00:18:50,437 --> 00:18:54,673
What? There's no way
mako would have told.

368
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,642
Right?

369
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,813
Poki, sit.

370
00:19:01,815 --> 00:19:03,782
Roll over.

371
00:19:03,784 --> 00:19:07,486
Good boy.

372
00:19:07,488 --> 00:19:08,620
Well done, Meelo.

373
00:19:08,622 --> 00:19:12,190
- I knew you could learn to train poki.
- Not just poki.

374
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,959
I trained all the lemurs.

375
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:16,194
Watch.

376
00:19:34,447 --> 00:19:38,984
I've created a monster.
Uh, maybe we should forget

377
00:19:38,986 --> 00:19:41,520
About all this training
discipline for now.

378
00:19:41,522 --> 00:19:46,224
- Why don't you and poki just have fun and play?
- Thanks, dad.

379
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:51,363
Training makes me tired.
Come on, Poki.

380
00:19:55,802 --> 00:19:58,737
You ratted me out
to the president?

381
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,374
- Korra, let me explain.
- Explain why my boyfriend stabbed me in the back?

382
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:06,178
Look, the president of the
Republic asked me a direct question.

383
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,849
- What was I supposed to do?
- You betrayed me and my family!

384
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:14,920
Enough!
Look, I have a job to do.

385
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,122
I can't constantly be worrying
about keeping you

386
00:20:17,124 --> 00:20:18,757
From making
another huge mistake.

387
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,125
Well, I have a job to do too,

388
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:23,462
Only it seems like you're always standing
in the way of me getting it done!

389
00:20:23,464 --> 00:20:26,231
Well, I guess if we're both
putting our jobs first,

390
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:30,702
Maybe there's no room
for our relationship!

391
00:20:31,838 --> 00:20:37,743
So what?
Are you breaking up with me?

392
00:20:37,745 --> 00:20:41,613
Yeah.
I guess I am.

393
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,189
What the flamey-o happened here?

394
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:54,826
- I broke up with the avatar.
- You got off easy.

395
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:59,731
You should have seen air temple
island after tenzin broke up with me.

396
00:21:14,947 --> 00:21:18,450
You ruined my wedding!

397
00:21:27,226 --> 00:21:30,762
No one steals my bolin!

398
00:23:00,323 --> 00:23:04,323
