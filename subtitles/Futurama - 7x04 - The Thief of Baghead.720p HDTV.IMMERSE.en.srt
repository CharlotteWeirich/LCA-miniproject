2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,873
As the curtain rises on our
verisimilidinous tableau,

3
00:00:23,998 --> 00:00:26,943
you're no doubt curious
as to why I tricked you all

4
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,778
into hang gliding here.

5
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,030
Close-up.

6
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,515
It seems someone in this room...

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,140
Is a murderer!

8
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,976
(Gasps)
It's me.

9
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:39,155
But the real question is,

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,458
which of you is the victim?

11
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:42,792
And that secret...

12
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:46,380
I shall take to my grave.

13
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,881
Calculon, no!

14
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,323
(Moans)

15
00:00:51,717 --> 00:00:54,670
(Calculon moaning, choking)

16
00:00:54,795 --> 00:00:56,515
Now, that's acting.

17
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,876
Calculon really shatnered
the hell out of that scene.

18
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:02,245
Hey, anyone want to
go to the aquarium?

19
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,980
They got a new non-biting otter.

20
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,481
(Cheering)

21
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:06,775
Sounds great!
Non-biting otter!

22
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,658
Fry:
Wow.

23
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,525
Aquariums have really changed
since I was a boy

24
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,194
and no one ever took me to them.

25
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,429
Where's the glass?
There isn't any.

26
00:01:20,554 --> 00:01:22,465
The water's held in place
by gravity fields,

27
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,433
so there's nothing for kids
to smear yogurt on.

28
00:01:24,558 --> 00:01:26,102
I like strawberry yogurt.

29
00:01:26,227 --> 00:01:27,470
Can I touch the water?

30
00:01:27,595 --> 00:01:30,139
I wouldn't, but I'm smart.

31
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:31,466
(Screams)

32
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:33,051
Help! Police!

33
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,302
At.

34
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,713
Welcome...

35
00:01:37,838 --> 00:01:40,267
To Jurassic tank.

36
00:01:42,576 --> 00:01:44,771
(Tex snorting, gasping)

37
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:46,857
Picture time.

38
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,191
Everybody get together.

39
00:01:48,357 --> 00:01:50,693
(Grumbling)

40
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,461
Hang on, I need a tripod.

41
00:01:52,586 --> 00:01:54,897
Let me just extend the old third leg.

42
00:01:55,022 --> 00:01:56,532
(Whirring)

43
00:01:56,657 --> 00:01:58,452
Ooh, yeah.
That's stable, baby.

44
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,036
Just need to pick a lens.

45
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,705
L's see... zoom lens?

46
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,623
Nope.

47
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:05,125
<i>They live</i> lens?

48
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,461
Eh, so-so.

49
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,088
<i>Twilight zone</i>
one-minute-in-the-future lens?

50
00:02:10,254 --> 00:02:12,674
Bender: Ooh, Calculon's
going to be here.

51
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,092
Better get my camera ready.

52
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:15,677
Just take the damn picture!

53
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:17,520
Let me just adjust the focus...

54
00:02:17,645 --> 00:02:18,788
F-stop...

55
00:02:18,913 --> 00:02:20,022
Shutter speed.

56
00:02:20,147 --> 00:02:22,391
Oops. Out of film. Hang on.

57
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:24,360
(Others sigh, grumble)

58
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:26,095
Film?
Who uses film?

59
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,397
We've had digital cameras
for a thousand years.

60
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:29,865
Digital? (Spits)

61
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,567
No digital camera can capture

62
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:33,736
the warmth and grain
of good old film.

63
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,104
How can you even tell?

64
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:37,106
Your eyes are digital cameras.

65
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:40,577
And where can you possibly get
film developed nowadays?

66
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,345
Right here.

67
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,832
You're looking at the last
chemical darkroom in existence.

68
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:47,216
Hey, Bender, isn't that Calculon?

69
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:48,718
Calculon? No way!

70
00:02:48,843 --> 00:02:51,546
Oh! Oh! Oh!

71
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:55,224
Yo, Calky! I'm a big fan,
and I've got a big camera.

72
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:56,718
Can I get a big picture?

73
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:58,361
(Sighs)

74
00:02:58,486 --> 00:03:01,030
Well, I was just airbrushed
this morning, so all right.

75
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:03,058
But make it snappy.

76
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,867
Eh, that looked staged.

77
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:06,102
Try one where you're pretending

78
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,395
to swing a tennis racquet.

79
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,273
Okay, okay, that's enough.

80
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:13,442
I'm trying to enjoy a nice day out

81
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:15,987
with the actors
who play my TV family.

82
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,549
These rare and
fascinating deep-sea fish

83
00:03:20,674 --> 00:03:22,785
are extremely sensitive to light

84
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,829
over here, Calculon!
Come on, smile!

85
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,039
Quit blinking!
Red eye!

86
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,833
Blurry!
Lens cap's still on!

87
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,262
Calculon:
Oh, we finally eluded

88
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:35,173
that obnoxious shutterbug.

89
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:39,068
At last, we can enjoy our
studio-mandated quality time.

90
00:03:39,193 --> 00:03:41,012
(Bender chuckles)

91
00:03:41,178 --> 00:03:44,057
! I can't t work like this.

92
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,476
I'll be in my day-off trailer.

93
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:50,897
(Bender screams, burbles)

94
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:56,736
And I took this one inside
the Ichthyosaur's stomach.

95
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:58,487
(Chucks)

96
00:03:58,612 --> 00:04:00,866
Man, I've never had anyone
try so hard to digest me.

97
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,659
OK, we've all been
in a sea monster's stomach.

98
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:06,204
But did you get any pictures
of the Calculon?

99
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,797
Yeah, but a true photo buff

100
00:04:07,922 --> 00:04:09,832
wouldn't even use these
for toilet paper.

101
00:04:09,957 --> 00:04:11,634
Not if curtains were available.

102
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,795
You're too hard on yourself, robot.

103
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:15,337
These pictures are just
as good as the ones

104
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:16,631
in my celebrity tabloid.

105
00:04:16,797 --> 00:04:19,217
Leela:
<i>Us people</i> magazine?

106
00:04:19,383 --> 00:04:20,476
That's total trash.

107
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:22,220
Total celebrity trash.

108
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:24,413
My inquiring organ wants to know.

109
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:27,616
If you ask me, Bender should
go to <i>us people's</i> office

110
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:30,119
in Hollywood and see if they'd
like his Calculon pictures.

111
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:31,438
(Scoffs)

112
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,107
I have no time for such foolishness.

113
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:39,654
Well, I changed my mind
and came to Hollywood after all.

114
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,164
Bender, these shots
of Calculon e great.

115
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:44,233
In fact, you might
just have what it takes

116
00:04:44,358 --> 00:04:45,534
to be a paparazzo.

117
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,037
Namely, a camera.

118
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,337
Shut up. I know it.

119
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:50,165
Wait... a whatsa-whatzo?

120
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,373
A paparazzo.

121
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:53,460
You know, a celebrity photographer.

122
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,844
But it's not for everyone.

123
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:56,712
You'd have to wallow
in Hollywood filth,

124
00:04:56,837 --> 00:04:59,648
loiter in dark alleys
behind seedy nightclubs

125
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:02,177
and get spat on
by the beautiful people.

126
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,420
Hmm, I don't ow.
How much will it cost me?

127
00:05:04,545 --> 00:05:05,921
You misunderstand, Bender.

128
00:05:06,046 --> 00:05:07,780
We'll pay you.

129
00:05:10,017 --> 00:05:13,772
Sir, you just hired yourself
a new whatsa-whatzo.

130
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,777
{pub}Listen up, gang.

131
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,552
I'd like to introduce you to Bender,

132
00:05:20,677 --> 00:05:23,240
the newest member of
our paparazzo family.

133
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,490
Nice to meet you.

134
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,225
And even though it's
only my first day,

135
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,393
I want you all to know that
I'm already better than you.

136
00:05:28,518 --> 00:05:29,862
Stay out of my way!

137
00:05:29,987 --> 00:05:31,248

What you watching?

142
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:12,956
Only a documentary about the
greatest actor in the world.

143
00:06:13,196 --> 00:06:14,740
Ah, yes... Calculon.

144
00:06:14,865 --> 00:06:16,675
I happened to snap a picture of him

145
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,795
taking some time
with his biggest fan.

146
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,346
No, not that scene-chewing ham.

147
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:24,082
I said the greatest actor...
Langdon Cobb.

148
00:06:24,207 --> 00:06:26,136
Let's rewind, shall we?

149
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:29,555
Narrator:
Langdon Cobb...

150
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,434
The most acclaimed actor
of his generation.

151
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,092
Why's he wearing a bag on his head?

152
00:06:34,217 --> 00:06:35,594
They're explaining that right n.

153
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:36,862
(Sighs)

154
00:06:36,987 --> 00:06:39,441
Let's rewind again.

155
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,134
Narrator: <i>...Most acclaimed
actor of his generation.</i>

156
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:45,237
<i>He's raked in seven
academy awards for best actor</i>

157
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:47,139
<i>and o for best actress,</i>

158
00:06:47,264 --> 00:06:50,493
<i>all without ever removing
his trademark bag.</i>

159
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:53,879
Mr. Cobb, you're
an intensely private man...

160
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:55,414
Quite right, mm-hmm.

161
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:57,583
... And though billions
of people have seen your wk,

162
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,918
- no one has ever seen your face.
- Mm-hmm.

163
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:02,254
So tell us.
Why the bag?

164
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:04,489
Ah, yes, the bag.

165
00:07:04,614 --> 00:07:06,925
I've never understood
people's fascination with that.

166
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,228
The point is, I'm an actor
and nothing more.

167
00:07:10,353 --> 00:07:12,097
I have no interest in being admired

168
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:14,733
for something as inconsequential
as my appearance

169
00:07:14,858 --> 00:07:16,068
or my personal life.

170
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:17,669
All that t matters is...

171
00:07:17,794 --> 00:07:19,814
The process.

172
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,901
Narrator: <i>Whether playing
a beloved historical figure...</i>

173
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,446
For Rigel 7...
And all mankind!

174
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,981
Narrator:
<i>...Or a Victorian circus freak...</i>

175
00:07:29,106 --> 00:07:31,516
I want to see the real you.

176
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:33,119
No, Daisy, don't!

177
00:07:34,444 --> 00:07:36,254
I tried to warn you.

178
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:37,489
I'm hideous.

179
00:07:37,614 --> 00:07:39,815
To me, you're beautiful.

180
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,364
Narrator:<i>... Langdon Cobb's
acting is always "in the bag."</i>

181
00:07:45,489 --> 00:07:48,967
<i>Truly, his is the most
famous face in Hollywood.</i>

182
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:51,803
<i>Even if no one's ever
photographed it,</i>

183
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:53,807
<i>nor ever will.</i>

184
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,769
Once again, television
has given me a reason to live.

185
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,345
A photo of Langdon Cobb
without his bag?

186
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,014
Impossible.

187
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:05,068
He's got a 50-foot-high
force field around his house.

188
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,737
Bender:
<i>One 60-foot ladder, please.</i>

189
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,574
(Chuckles)

190
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,576
(Pants, grunts)

191
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,666
(Grunts)

192
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,199
(Sneaky chuckle)

193
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:22,419
(Growling)

194
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,504
(Snarling)

195
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,971
Oh!

196
00:08:26,096 --> 00:08:27,706
What are you,
some kind of attack fungus?

197
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:29,175
Or just a moldy schnauzer?

198
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:31,010
(Barks, Bender yells)

199
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:33,345
Oh, God, please let this
tacky Hollywood mansion

200
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,848
have the obligatory.
Yes!

201
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,381
Tuscan-inspired pergola!

202
00:08:36,506 --> 00:08:38,183
(Bender grunting, creature growls)

203
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:39,518
(Chuckles)

204
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,105
Peace out, Portobello.

205
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,992
Thank you, Leroy.

206
00:08:47,117 --> 00:08:48,817
I'm going to relax by the fire
with my bag off,

207
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:50,562
so that will be all for the night.

208
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,621
By your command.

209
00:08:55,525 --> 00:08:57,704
(Quietly):
Come to paparazzo.

210
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,544
Asps)

211
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:07,297
- Gotcha!
- No!

212
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:09,848
Please, sir, I implore you,

213
00:09:09,973 --> 00:09:11,759
destroy that photo of me.

214
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:14,419
It's not just my privacy I've
been protecting all these years.

215
00:09:14,544 --> 00:09:16,555
If you show anyone that picture,

216
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,600
there will be terrible consequences.

217
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,059
The only thing terrible's
going to be my bank account.

218
00:09:21,184 --> 00:09:22,661
Wait. Say that again,

219
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:24,939
what say "tremendous consequences."

220
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:27,432
If it's money you're after,
I'll pay whatever you ask.

221
00:09:27,557 --> 00:09:31,403
Just promise me you'll never
show that photo to anyone.

222
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,116
I swear on my honor as a paparazzo.

223
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:37,160
Hey, Fry, want to see a picture?

224
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,467
Sure.

225
00:09:42,706 --> 00:09:43,949
Hmm.

226
00:09:44,074 --> 00:09:45,851
He looked at the photo
and that happened.

227
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:47,879
But... it could just
be a coincidence.

228
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,339
Yo, Amy, check it out.

229
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:54,926
The evidence is mounting.

230
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:57,263
Although two times hardly
establishes a pattern.

231
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:59,064
I'd feel more comfortable
raising the alarm

232
00:09:59,189 --> 00:10:00,632
if I were a little more certain.

233
00:10:00,757 --> 00:10:02,477
Hey, how'd those two get deflated?

234
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,827
They looked at this.

235
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:07,272
(Gasps)

236
00:10:07,397 --> 00:10:08,640
That proves it.

237
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:10,108
Looking at this photo of Langdon Cobb

238
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:11,743
has a horrific effect
on living creatures.

239
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:13,363
(Door slides open)

240
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,281
Hey, Zoidberg, look at this
photo of Langdon Cobb.

241
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:18,383
What, a picture of Langdon Cobb?

242
00:10:18,508 --> 00:10:21,453
Now, this I want to see
as clearly as possible.

243
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,922
Zoidberg, no!

244
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:25,290
(Grunts)

245
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:27,459
Oh, thank God, Professor.

246
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:29,879
You got here just in time.

247
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:32,006
Professor:
I've seen this before.

248
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:35,009
Langdon Cobb must be
from Bryoria Six,

249
00:10:35,175 --> 00:10:37,302
home of the quantum lichen people.

250
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:39,430
Well, that explains that.

251
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:41,006
They're attention parasites.

252
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:43,942
They feed on the admiration
of their prey.

253
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,777
Just like the noble buffalo.

254
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:47,397
Nothing like a buffalo.

255
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,548
Anyone who pays
attention to the lichen

256
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:51,082
is unknowingly feeding it.

257
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:54,452
But gaze upon its face,
even in a photograph,

258
00:10:54,577 --> 00:10:57,155
and your very life force
will be sucked out,

259
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,534
leaving you a flaccid husk.

260
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,827
So the picture robbed them
of the souls?

261
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,829
Souls? Don't be ridiculous.

262
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,964
It's their life forces
that have been stolen.

263
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:07,959
It's scientific.

264
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,467
That's why the robot's immune.

265
00:11:09,592 --> 00:11:10,869
He has no soul.

266
00:11:10,994 --> 00:11:12,504
Life force!

267
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:15,425
So, how do we get
their "life forces" back?

268
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,310
If we poke a hole in Cobb's bag,
will they spew out

269
00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:20,011
like a volcano built
on an Indian graveyard?

270
00:11:20,136 --> 00:11:22,682
Alas, it's not that simple.

271
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,183
You e, just as the
earth lichen is composed

272
00:11:25,308 --> 00:11:26,618
of an algae and a fungus,

273
00:11:26,743 --> 00:11:28,687
the quantum variety is also comped

274
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:31,156
of two separed parts.

275
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:33,291
An attractive algae-based id

276
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,461
and a ravenous
fungus based ego

277
00:11:36,586 --> 00:11:39,164
that stores the stolen souls.

278
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:42,067
I mean, life forces.

279
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:43,995
Now, here's the weird pa.

280
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,138
The ego and the id
are connected not physically,

281
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:49,507
like decent, God-fearing earth liens,

282
00:11:49,632 --> 00:11:51,076
but by quantum entanglement.

283
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:53,338
(Trilling)

284
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,214
So the id is Langdon Cobb,
but this fungus ego could be...

285
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,750
Anywhere, we'll never find it!

286
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,253
Let's just give up and go
to the aquarium again.

287
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:02,680
Now, hold on.

288
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:04,856
I feel like I was chased
by a mushroom recently.

289
00:12:04,981 --> 00:12:07,659
Of course!
The guard dog at Cobb's estate.

290
00:12:07,784 --> 00:12:09,060
That's the ego.

291
00:12:09,185 --> 00:12:10,562
All right, let's go.

292
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:12,607
It'll be just like stomping a puppy.

293
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:16,361
No, no, no. Subduing an actor's
ego is no easy task.

294
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,936
We'll have to weaken it first.

295
00:12:18,061 --> 00:12:21,072
Look, I own words that are helpful.

296
00:12:21,197 --> 00:12:22,607
It says the world acting championship

297
00:12:22,732 --> 00:12:23,909
is tonight in Hollywood.

298
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,176
Quiet, Zoidberg.

299
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:27,622
God, I wish you were a husk.

300
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,041
No, it's Langdon Cobb
versus Calculon.

301
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,416
If we help Calculon win,

302
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,218
will weaken Cobb's ego, may?

303
00:12:33,343 --> 00:12:35,787
Yes, yes, fine.

304
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:38,675
(Petulantly)
We never go where I want to go.

305
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:43,094
So, the most galling
of the paparazzi needs my help.

306
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:45,897
Lo the worm has turned.

307
00:12:46,022 --> 00:12:48,934
Say cheese, Calculon without makeup.

308
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:53,481
(Sighs) As much as I hate you,
I hate Langdon Cobb more.

309
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,141
He beats me out
for every award, every role,

310
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:57,777
every paternity suit.

311
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:02,198
Besting him at acting means more
to me than life itself.

312
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,782
And we want to help you.

313
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:05,884
Now, your only chance
a classic death scene.

314
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:07,786
One with a lot of thy's and thou's.

315
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:09,120
Voilá.

316
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:11,749
The tragic end
of Rome o. And Julie t.

317
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:13,658
That's <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i> dummy,

318
00:13:13,783 --> 00:13:15,894
by Will.I.Am Shakespeare.

319
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,730
Now, here's the poison
that Romeo uses to kill himself.

320
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:20,842
Don't worry, it's just
water and food coloring.

321
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,434
Food coloring?

322
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,769
The most poisonous substance
known to robots?

323
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:26,304
Oops, sorry.

324
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:28,273
I'll swap it out
for harmless battery acid.

325
00:13:28,398 --> 00:13:30,175
No. Wait.

326
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,311
There's on one way to ensure victory.

327
00:13:33,436 --> 00:13:36,648
I must perform
the ultimate death scene.

328
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,017
Shall drink the actual poison...

329
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:41,863
And actually die.

330
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,074
But... but, Calculon,
you can't kill yourself.

331
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,493
I'm a celebrity.
I can kill anyone I want!

332
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,013
{pub}- Call it in the air.
- Comedy.

333
00:13:58,211 --> 00:13:59,297
It's tragedy.

334
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,049
Langdon Cobb will be first
to take the stage.

335
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:04,351
Bossy to stinky.
Come in, stinky.

336
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,053
Zoidberg:
I always come in stinky.

337
00:14:06,219 --> 00:14:08,122
Standby. The competition's
about to begin.

338
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,348
(Groans)

339
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:10,924
Hold your fire

340
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:12,977
til Calculon's performance
weakens the ego.

341
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,561
Roger. Stinky over.

342
00:14:14,686 --> 00:14:17,023
Whoof! I beg to differ.

343
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:19,859
I wish it had been me, Sully.

344
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,902
I wish it had been me
off-duty in the garden

345
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,304
when those drug lords
blew up the Celtics.

346
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:27,700
But I was drunk, wicked drunk!

347
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:30,511
Uh-oh. Cobb's doing a scene
from <i>beantown buddies.</i>

348
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,212
The audience is eating it up.

349
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:34,100
Professor, what's
your status?

350
00:14:34,225 --> 00:14:35,374
Not good!

351
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,086
The attention Cobb's receiving
is inflating his ego.

352
00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:41,145
It's going totally Kanye!

353
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:46,219
Ah! There's a humungous
fungus among us.

354
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:50,697
Oh, Sully, you were
the best partner I ever had,

355
00:14:50,822 --> 00:14:53,800
both on the be and in the sack.

356
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:57,070
That's right, I said it.

357
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:58,572
(Sobbing):
I said it!

358
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,775
Aah!

359
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:04,135
(Sobbing)

360
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,154
A tough act to follow.

361
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,623
And now, to follow that act,

362
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:20,328
performing the death scene
from <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>

363
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:24,722
seven-time Oscar runner-up, Calculon!

364
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,301
(Applause)

365
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:34,934
(Soft piano notes play)

366
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,447
Ah, dear Juliet,
why art thou yet so fair?

367
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,249
I will stay with thee;

368
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:46,863
and never from this palace
of dim night depart again.

369
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,991
O, here will I set up
my everlasting rest

370
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,120
and shake the yoke
of inauspicious stars

371
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,497
from this world-wearied flesh.

372
00:15:57,664 --> 00:16:00,200
Eyes, look your last.

373
00:16:00,325 --> 00:16:03,503
Arms, take your last embrace

374
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:07,608
and lips, of you,
the doors of breath,

375
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,701
seal with a righteous kiss.

376
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,976
Here's to my love.

377
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:21,647
(Gasping)

378
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:23,948
Oh(Gurgling)

379
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,905
(Death rattle)

380
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,698
I can't believe he really did it.

381
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:34,785
(Voice breaks): At lea
he died knowing I was great.

382
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:37,261
(Death rattle ends)

383
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:41,167
(Applause and cheering)

384
00:16:44,377 --> 00:16:47,548
Uh-oh. That death scene
was almost half believable.

385
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:49,082
Cobb looks jealous and insecure.

386
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:50,317
How's his ego doing?

387
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:51,551
It's shrinking.

388
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:53,520
Faster, Professor, kill, kill.

389
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:57,524
Activating anti-fungal ray.

390
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:01,128
It just has to warm up
for about 15 minutes.

391
00:17:01,394 --> 00:17:02,963
(Roars)
Ooh!

392
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,234
Ladies and gentlemen and smizmars,

393
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,503
we have a unanimous decision.

394
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,272
The winner, and heavyweight
acting champion

395
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:13,574
of the world,

396
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,134
Langdon Cobb!

397
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,518
Huh.

398
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,386
Thank you. Thank you.

399
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:27,797
Thanks.

400
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,990
Oh, God, he's basking
in their admiration.

401
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:33,552
That ego must be at least
four feet tall by now.

402
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:35,996
(Roars)

403
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,222
(Professor, Zoidberg yelling)

404
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,025
Aw, did you miss me, pookie?

405
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:49,343
(Captives grunting and groaning)

406
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:50,610
I can't watch!

407
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:52,530
I better take some pictures.

408
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,980
Wait a minute.

409
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:55,816
When living creatures look
at Cobb'b's photo,

410
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,651
their life force gets sucked out.

411
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,186
And Cobb's a living creature.

412
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,164
I just need to show him
a picture of himself.

413
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,424
But I tore up the on picture of Cobb.

414
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:06,593
And everybody knows,
once you delete a photo,

415
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,546
it's gone forever.

416
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,105
Maybe a digital photo,

417
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,733
but with film,
I still ha the negative.

418
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,401
Hurry, make a new print!

419
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,636
I don't know how long I
can distract Cobb's ego.

420
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:18,362
Okay. I'll be in the darkroom.

421
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,274
(Grunts)

422
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:23,076
(Yelling)

423
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:24,437
(Blow lands)

424
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:29,507
Eh. Contrasts a little off
on this one.

425
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:33,553
(Grunting)

426
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:35,031
(Shrieks)

427
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,824
Bender, hurry up!

428
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,092
This one is really good.

429
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:42,580
But I can still do better.

430
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,097
Who are you people?

431
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:45,666
Why are you attacking my ego?

432
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:47,877
You stole our friends' life forces.

433
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:51,805
Ah, yes. I warned the robot,
but he wouldn't listen.

434
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,608
You see, I was once like
the rest of my species,

435
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,676
showing my face to one planet,

436
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:58,971
draining its life force and moving on.

437
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:03,100
T when I got to earth, I found
a different kind of prey.

438
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:05,019
Explain. (Grunts)

439
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,454
You earthlings worship celebrity
with such fervor

440
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,690
that I can survive simply
by milking your admiration.

441
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:14,194
Milking and milking it
through what we tors call...

442
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,462
The process.

443
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,324
Oh, God, just kill us already!

444
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,267
But you all discovered my secret.

445
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:23,496
And for that, you will pay.
Look at me!

446
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,791
If we do, will you stop talking
about the process?

447
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,834
Never. Behold!

448
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:37,408
(Cobb laughs)

449
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,811
I'll save you, Leela,
Professor and Zoidberg.

450
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,757
Oops.

451
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,959
Nonetheless, I finally nailed it.

452
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,161
Ga upon this photo of yourself

453
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:50,898
and start squirting out
some soul-a-rrhea.

454
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,666
It doesn't work that way,
you imbecile.

455
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,167
Although...

456
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:56,570
It's really quite a nice portrait.

457
00:19:56,736 --> 00:19:58,605
The contrast is exquisite.

458
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,342
And the composition...
Sublime.

459
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,669
I look... spectacular.

460
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:06,038
Ah, man.

461
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:08,539
My great photo
only made his ego bigger.

462
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:20,660
. No!

463
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:21,895
(Grunts)

464
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,163
(Whooshing)

465
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,056
(Gasping)

466
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,271
Hey, Calculon's dead.

467
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,005
What happened?
Did you save us, Leela?

468
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,273
Actually, no.

469
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,841
For once, it was Bender.

470
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:38,487
Really? Well, thanks for
whatever you did, Bender.

471
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:40,823
It was a lot.
You'll never be able to pay any back.

472
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,164
Now, gather round friends.

473
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:45,077
So we can commemorate
this moment in a photo.

474
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:48,042
I gotta admit.

475
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:50,762
This time it'll a pleasure
to be in your picture.

476
00:20:51,469 --> 00:20:52,947
Say: "Bender is great."

477
00:20:53,072 --> 00:20:54,712
Bender is great!

478
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,131
