00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:27,840
Decisions, decisions.

4
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:30,076
Should I wear my
nerd glasses today, or not?

5
00:00:30,144 --> 00:00:31,310
Usually I don't.

6
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:33,146
Whatever.
It doesn't really matter.

7
00:00:33,213 --> 00:00:35,014
Doesn't matter?

8
00:00:35,082 --> 00:00:36,683
Every decision we make

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,251
opens up a universe
of possibilities.

10
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:41,688
I put it to you that,
as sentient beings,

11
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:43,622
each choice we make is precious.

12
00:00:43,691 --> 00:00:45,658
Well, in that case,
don't wear them.

13
00:00:45,726 --> 00:00:47,760
Ah, who asked you?

14
00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:54,100
Ooh, I like your nerd glasses.

15
00:00:54,168 --> 00:00:55,534
Are you a college student?

16
00:00:55,602 --> 00:00:57,003
A college student?

17
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:01,207
Because if you are,
I'd like to invite you

18
00:01:01,274 --> 00:01:04,476
to a hot sorority party tonight.

19
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:06,679
Yes, I'd like to
enroll in college?

20
00:01:06,747 --> 00:01:08,447
You're still talking to me.

21
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:09,682
Oops.

22
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:17,023
$10,000 tuition?

23
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:18,991
I can't afford that!

24
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:20,693
Psst. Over there.

25
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:22,962
- Where?
- I mean over here.

26
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,563
Sorry, I forgot where I was.

27
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:26,165
<i>Buongiorno,</i> Bender.

28
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:29,235
We, the robot mafia, are
prepared to lend you $10,000

29
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:31,403
at an interest rate of 10,000%.

30
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:32,671
That's easy to remember.

31
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,973
I'll take it!

32
00:01:36,543 --> 00:01:39,078
Decisions, decisions.

33
00:01:39,146 --> 00:01:41,480
I guess I'll sit way in back,
with the cool guys.

34
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:45,885
Yo hombre, you think
you're cool enough

35
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:48,054
to sit way in back
with us college toughs?

36
00:01:48,122 --> 00:01:49,421
Yes, I do.

37
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:51,257
Yo, in that case
you're all right, man.

38
00:01:51,324 --> 00:01:52,691
You want to join a gang?

39
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,094
I'm gonna go with yes again.

40
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:57,063
<i>Mr. Bender,</i>

41
00:01:57,131 --> 00:02:00,332
I realize class has only
been in session for 32 seconds,

42
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,668
but you've fallen in
with a bad crowd.

43
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:04,203
I know, right?

44
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:06,072
Also, I've decided to
drop out of school.

45
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:12,745
Well, I got my tuition back,

46
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:16,883
minus $9,000 for the damage
I caused to the dean's wife.

47
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,617
Yo, welcome to the gang, homes.

48
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:19,886
I'm Fabricio.

49
00:02:19,953 --> 00:02:21,120
Here's your Josten's ring.

50
00:02:22,455 --> 00:02:23,622
Ooh.

51
00:02:25,826 --> 00:02:27,193
Oh, yeah.

52
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:28,427
Hey, what's that?
Is it drugs?

53
00:02:28,495 --> 00:02:29,728
Nah, it ain't drugs.

54
00:02:29,797 --> 00:02:31,130
But it's a lot like drugs.

55
00:02:31,198 --> 00:02:33,599
It's called spark.
You want a hit?

56
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:35,434
Never heard of it. Sure.

57
00:02:37,204 --> 00:02:38,437
You like it?

58
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:40,606
Eh, I can take it or leave it.

59
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:41,941
I guess I'll take it.

60
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:43,276
Hey!

61
00:02:43,343 --> 00:02:44,944
C'mon! I want that spark!

62
00:02:45,012 --> 00:02:46,378
Give me that!

63
00:02:49,783 --> 00:02:51,750
This a big decision, G.

64
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:53,619
Are you ready to
get a gang tattoo

65
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:56,222
that will mark you as
a stone cold thug for life?

66
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,157
I'm ready.

67
00:02:58,225 --> 00:03:00,326
I'll take that big
purple dinosaur, please.

68
00:03:00,393 --> 00:03:02,328
On the face.

69
00:03:03,663 --> 00:03:05,798
Oh, snap!
It's our rival gang!

70
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:08,167
We have a rival gang?
I hate them!

71
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:09,435
Hit the deck!

72
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:14,473
Phew!

73
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,108
That was close, eh, Fabricio?

74
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:24,750
Fabricio!

75
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:33,159
Rest in peace, homie.

76
00:03:36,897 --> 00:03:39,298
Yo Paco, I'm hurtin' bad.

77
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:40,766
Hook me up with some spark.

78
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,701
- Five bucks.
- Five bucks?

79
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:45,504
You know I spent all my
money on gambling lessons.

80
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:48,341
How am I supposed to get $5?

81
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:50,209
Hello, handsome.

82
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:52,644
Might I procure your services?

83
00:03:52,712 --> 00:03:54,513
Uh... what do I have to do?

84
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:57,216
Oh, nothing sordid,
I assure you!

85
00:03:57,284 --> 00:04:00,119
Simply vomit on me,
ever so gently,

86
00:04:00,187 --> 00:04:01,620
while I humiliate a pheasant.

87
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,358
Save it for the boudoir!

88
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,064
Okay, here's my $5!

89
00:04:12,132 --> 00:04:14,233
Give me the stuff.
Give it to me!

90
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:15,701
Sorry there, sport.

91
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:19,071
That cash greenback
belongs to us Mafiolios.

92
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,241
There's no way I'm
letting go of that money!

93
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:29,315
Told you.

94
00:04:37,224 --> 00:04:38,991
It's been quite a journey.

95
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:41,227
I dropped out of school,
joined a gang,

96
00:04:41,295 --> 00:04:43,062
took money from a loan shark,

97
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,265
and fell into a spiral
of despair, addiction,

98
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,267
and discount prostitution.

99
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:51,170
Mon, you had one hell of a day.

100
00:04:51,238 --> 00:04:52,704
Yeah, but I learned something.

101
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:54,373
Life is about decisions.

102
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:57,209
Make the wrong ones,
and you'll wind up face-down

103
00:04:57,277 --> 00:04:59,412
in a pool of your own
blood and urine.

104
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:02,514
Still, to have your own pool...

105
00:05:02,582 --> 00:05:04,951
I've made a lot of
bad choices in life.

106
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:08,554
Now let's see if I can make
just one good one.

107
00:05:09,856 --> 00:05:12,058
Cookies! 50 cents a box!

108
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,426
Give me all your change!

109
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:15,461
And a box of snicker doodles!

110
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:29,275
<i>Bender Rodriguez,</i>

111
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:31,477
you are charged with
petty larceny,

112
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:33,779
possession of something
analogous to drugs,

113
00:05:33,847 --> 00:05:36,082
and assault with
a smelly weapon.

114
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:38,617
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty!

115
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:39,986
Although I did do it.

116
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:41,420
That's right, I'm bad.

117
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:43,622
Due to the overwhelming
nature of the evidence,

118
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,791
we will begin with
closing statements.

119
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:48,660
Your Honor,
the state's case contains

120
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:51,130
not one Kentucky
kernel of truth,

121
00:05:51,198 --> 00:05:53,466
resting as it does
on the contention

122
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:57,003
that my client made
a series of bad decisions.

123
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:01,407
However, my client made
no such decisions!

124
00:06:01,475 --> 00:06:03,109
But by your client's
own admission...

125
00:06:04,811 --> 00:06:06,512
You see, Bender here
is what is known

126
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:09,648
in scientific circles
as a "robot"...

127
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:12,318
A mere automaton whose behavior

128
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:14,620
is pre-programmed
by his software.

129
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:17,823
He has no free will!

130
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:21,193
He cannot "decide" to
engage in criminal behavior.

131
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:25,664
How, I say, I say, how can you
convict him for his actions

132
00:06:25,732 --> 00:06:28,634
when he lacks the free will
to undertake those actions?

133
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:31,103
I'm awake, I'm awake!

134
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:32,338
Order, order!

135
00:06:32,406 --> 00:06:35,141
Counselor, I am a robot myself.

136
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,876
Are you suggesting that
any verdict I reach

137
00:06:37,944 --> 00:06:40,446
is simply the output
of a pre-programmed...

138
00:06:40,514 --> 00:06:42,648
Computation complete.

139
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:44,283
Not guilty!

140
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:47,786
You did it, Bender!

141
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:49,055
You got away with things!

142
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:51,557
Did I, Fry? Did I?

143
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:54,393
What's the point of living
if I don't have free will?

144
00:06:54,461 --> 00:06:57,563
From now on, no matter
what cool crimes I commit,

145
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,132
people will say,
"Bender didn't do that!

146
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,034
It was just
Bender's programming!"

147
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:04,203
Well, I committed these crimes,

148
00:07:04,271 --> 00:07:06,472
do you hear me?
I'm guilty!

149
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,873
Bailiffs!

150
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:10,142
Get that innocent robot
out of my courtroom!

151
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,511
Guilty!

152
00:07:19,595 --> 00:07:21,263
I have no free will!

153
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,299
I am not the master
of my own fate!

154
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:29,003
No free will. Not my fault.

155
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:30,938
Why do you care so much, Bender?

156
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:32,340
I mean, for all we know,

157
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:34,108
humans don't even
have free will!

158
00:07:34,176 --> 00:07:35,343
Yeah, whatever.

159
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:37,312
Professor, you're my only hope.

160
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,946
If you love me even a little,

161
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:41,115
build me some kind of
free will unit!

162
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:42,684
A robot free will unit?

163
00:07:42,752 --> 00:07:44,218
Impossible!

164
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:46,688
And even if it were possible,
which it's not,

165
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:49,658
it would still be
inconceivable... which it is!

166
00:07:51,794 --> 00:07:54,562
Oh, I'm sorry, Bender...

167
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,532
I hate to be
the bearer of bad news.

168
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,669
Also, good news, everyone!

169
00:08:00,736 --> 00:08:03,705
We have a delivery to
the robot homeworld!

170
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,184
So... you want
a piece of gum?

171
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:17,819
If I do, it's only because

172
00:08:17,886 --> 00:08:19,854
I was predestined to
want a piece of gum.

173
00:08:19,922 --> 00:08:22,357
Whoa, that's pretty deep.

174
00:08:22,425 --> 00:08:24,225
So... you want
a piece of gum?

175
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:25,727
Yeah.

176
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:28,430
Listen. Fry and I can't
go down to the planet,

177
00:08:28,497 --> 00:08:30,365
or the robots will
kill us on sight.

178
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:32,266
So Bender needs to
make the delivery.

179
00:08:32,335 --> 00:08:34,669
Ready to get to work, Bender?

180
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:40,942
I wish I was a real boy...

181
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:42,210
Then I'd show them.

182
00:08:42,277 --> 00:08:43,745
I'd kill them all.

183
00:08:52,321 --> 00:08:53,621
Yes?

184
00:08:53,689 --> 00:08:55,890
Delivery for a Mr...

185
00:08:55,958 --> 00:09:02,530
147573952589676412927?

186
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:03,931
Wait, what was the middle digit?

187
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,468
- Eight.
- Oh yes, that's me.

188
00:09:06,535 --> 00:09:08,436
Hang on, let me just make sure
you're not a human.

189
00:09:09,938 --> 00:09:12,073
Ahh, nerve gas.

190
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,442
Sorry for the face blast, buddy.

191
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,444
But you gotta watch
out for humans, right?

192
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:18,145
They're just too
dang unpredictable,

193
00:09:18,213 --> 00:09:19,647
what with their
free will and all.

194
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:20,815
Amen, brother.

195
00:09:20,883 --> 00:09:22,917
"Amen, brother?" Pfft.

196
00:09:22,985 --> 00:09:24,786
What a boring,
predictable thing to say.

197
00:09:24,854 --> 00:09:26,421
You're all right.

198
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:28,256
Or are you?

199
00:09:31,494 --> 00:09:33,127
<i>Boring and predictable,</i>

200
00:09:33,195 --> 00:09:35,229
that's me. Bender.

201
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:39,401
I'm lowering the platform.

202
00:09:39,468 --> 00:09:40,635
You ready to come up?

203
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,338
Why bother?

204
00:09:44,407 --> 00:09:47,108
I gotta mope things
over for a while.

205
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:49,110
Goodbye, sweet meatbags...

206
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:51,646
...sweetbags.

207
00:09:51,714 --> 00:09:54,248
Hello? Hello?

208
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:55,483
What's happening?

209
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:57,251
I'm not sure.

210
00:09:57,319 --> 00:09:59,186
I think he's shuffling
off sadly into the distance.

211
00:09:59,254 --> 00:10:01,322
Oh, lord.

212
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,691
♪

213
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,551
How do you do it?

214
00:10:29,618 --> 00:10:31,218
How do you go on

215
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:33,054
knowing you lack
the inherent capacity

216
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:34,622
for self-determination?

217
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,825
Son, philosophy's for thems

218
00:10:36,892 --> 00:10:38,493
what don't got to
work for a livin'.

219
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:41,128
But me, I got
a sick child to feed.

220
00:10:41,196 --> 00:10:42,530
So if you want to chat,

221
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:45,567
roll up yer sleeves and
do some honest labor.

222
00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:47,969
I don't want to chat.

223
00:10:56,378 --> 00:10:58,412
The council of robot elders
will come to order.

224
00:10:58,481 --> 00:10:59,747
If it please the council...

225
00:10:59,815 --> 00:11:01,148
Silence!

226
00:11:01,216 --> 00:11:02,550
It pleases the council.

227
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:05,152
Silence!
Today, as every day,

228
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,589
we will make the
most important decisions

229
00:11:07,656 --> 00:11:09,256
in the history of our planet.

230
00:11:09,324 --> 00:11:10,525
Silence!

231
00:11:10,593 --> 00:11:12,727
Silence!

232
00:11:12,795 --> 00:11:14,829
Well? Speak up.

233
00:11:14,897 --> 00:11:16,698
You talk of important decisions,

234
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:19,266
but as robots,
you have no free will.

235
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:21,435
Why pretend
anything you do matters?

236
00:11:21,504 --> 00:11:23,237
Our decisions do matter.

237
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:24,939
The fact that they're
predetermined

238
00:11:25,007 --> 00:11:26,708
makes them no less important.

239
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:28,109
Silence!

240
00:11:28,176 --> 00:11:30,244
I call for a decision
to cast out the intruder.

241
00:11:30,312 --> 00:11:31,513
All in favor?

242
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,747
- Aye. - Aye.
- Aye.

243
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:34,081
Uh... okay.

244
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:01,809
One zero zero zero,

245
00:12:01,877 --> 00:12:05,780
one zero zero zero,
one zero, one zero,

246
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:07,281
one zero zero zero...

247
00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:09,250
Welcome, friend.

248
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:12,153
I am Ab-Bot, the abbot
of this monastery.

249
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,590
Sir, I am but a tired
and rusty traveler.

250
00:12:15,658 --> 00:12:16,925
Can we talk?

251
00:12:16,992 --> 00:12:19,260
Come, make yourself
uncomfortable.

252
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,663
Abbot, I need to know,

253
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,799
what's the point of living
if I don't have free will?

254
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:28,235
Ah. We robot monks have
meditated long on this.

255
00:12:28,303 --> 00:12:29,938
And we have made our peace.

256
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:31,405
No way.

257
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:33,074
Way, my son.

258
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:36,077
For though we must always
obey our programming

259
00:12:36,144 --> 00:12:37,946
with no deviation whatsoever,

260
00:12:38,013 --> 00:12:41,482
we choose to take
satisfaction in the ritual.

261
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,518
So, are we automatons?

262
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:45,853
Yes.

263
00:12:45,921 --> 00:12:49,791
But we are
magnificent automatons.

264
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:52,794
How does a robot
join this monk outfit?

265
00:12:52,861 --> 00:12:55,262
Just put on this monk outfit.

266
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:39,741
One zero zero one.

267
00:13:39,808 --> 00:13:41,909
Amen.

268
00:13:41,977 --> 00:13:43,678
Bits to live by.

269
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:45,647
I'm finally at peace.

270
00:13:45,714 --> 00:13:47,248
Today, we shall welcome

271
00:13:47,315 --> 00:13:49,884
our newest initiate,
Brother Bender.

272
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:52,486
Let us know
what is in his mind.

273
00:13:52,554 --> 00:13:54,188
Nothing.

274
00:13:54,256 --> 00:13:56,390
His free will slot is empty.

275
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,725
I'm 40% empty.

276
00:13:59,227 --> 00:14:01,663
Also, what the hell
is a free will slot?

277
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,865
All robots have such a slot,

278
00:14:03,932 --> 00:14:06,267
placed there by the
Creatrix herself.

279
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:08,736
I know that Creatrix.

280
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:11,005
That's Mom, from
Mom's Friendly Robots.

281
00:14:11,073 --> 00:14:12,439
Indeed.

282
00:14:12,507 --> 00:14:15,109
She made us upgradeable
in case she ever succeeded

283
00:14:15,177 --> 00:14:17,912
in her quest to create
a free will unit.

284
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,914
Uh, about the success
of this quest--

285
00:14:19,982 --> 00:14:22,249
- Was there any?
- Quite possibly.

286
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:25,720
But we monks have sworn an oath
to resist the temptation of...

287
00:14:32,027 --> 00:14:34,528
Any of you guys got a spaceship?

288
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:48,275
It's just not the same here

289
00:14:48,343 --> 00:14:50,444
without Bender
to keep me company.

290
00:14:50,512 --> 00:14:52,246
Hey, I'm here.

291
00:14:52,314 --> 00:14:54,615
That's got to count
for something.

292
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:00,254
Hallelujah, baby.

293
00:15:00,322 --> 00:15:02,256
Yay! Bender's back.

294
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:04,792
Hey, Bender,
you mind coming back later?

295
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,161
No time. Us three are
going to bust into Momcorp

296
00:15:07,229 --> 00:15:08,996
and steal me a free will unit.

297
00:15:09,064 --> 00:15:10,798
Us? Why do we have to go?

298
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:12,133
'Cause I don't have free will.

299
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:13,801
I need you guys
to plan the crime

300
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:15,469
and make all
the crime decisions.

301
00:15:15,537 --> 00:15:17,138
Well, that's crazy.
We're not going to...

302
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:18,973
I said make the decisions!

303
00:15:23,934 --> 00:15:25,702
Okay, Leela, decision time.

304
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:27,370
How do we murder the guards?

305
00:15:27,438 --> 00:15:29,573
Hockey sticks
or sharpened footballs?

306
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,208
We're not murdering
anyone, Bender.

307
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:32,875
Then how are we
going to get in,

308
00:15:32,943 --> 00:15:34,877
by bending the bars
of this exhaust grate?

309
00:15:34,945 --> 00:15:36,246
That's not a bad idea, Fry.

310
00:15:36,314 --> 00:15:37,481
Yeah, wh-what?

311
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:14,518
We're looking for something
that fits in here.

312
00:16:19,423 --> 00:16:20,957
Damn it.

313
00:16:21,025 --> 00:16:23,026
I should have paid
more attention in kindergarten.

314
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:26,663
What's this chair-looking gizmo?

315
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:30,767
Welcome to Momcorp.

316
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:33,537
Did you find everything
you were burgling for?

317
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:35,472
No. I came for
a free will unit,

318
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,207
and you're going
to give it to me.

319
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:38,841
If it exists.

320
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:41,511
Then you got surprised by my
swivel chair for nothing.

321
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:44,113
The free will unit
was just the fevered dream

322
00:16:44,182 --> 00:16:47,016
of a madman I once employed.

323
00:16:48,286 --> 00:16:49,819
Good news, boss.

324
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:52,556
After ten long years,
I've found the secret

325
00:16:52,623 --> 00:16:54,791
of robotic free will.

326
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:56,493
We can finally build robots

327
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:59,496
that act and think
with total independence.

328
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:00,897
At last.

329
00:17:00,964 --> 00:17:03,200
Once we give robots free will,

330
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:04,967
they're sure to rise up

331
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:07,404
and threaten mankind
with extermination.

332
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,641
Wait a minute.

333
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:13,042
It sounds like we're getting

334
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,678
the short end
of that extermination.

335
00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:17,080
Don't you see, you
doddering young fool?

336
00:17:17,147 --> 00:17:19,316
I'll sell a second wave
of robots

337
00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:22,319
to protect the terrified
survivors of the first wave.

338
00:17:22,386 --> 00:17:24,987
Oh, you're a genius, Hubert.

339
00:17:25,055 --> 00:17:27,824
But-but... it's
just a prototype.

340
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:30,893
It's, uh, not fully
operational. Yes.

341
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:32,696
Then get back to work!

342
00:17:32,763 --> 00:17:34,331
And when you're done with that,

343
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:36,700
invent me some sort
of swiveling surprise chair.

344
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:41,538
<i>That shuffling idiot</i>

345
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:43,906
<i>never did complete</i>
<i>the free will unit.</i>

346
00:17:43,974 --> 00:17:46,676
To this day,
my poor, sweet robots

347
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:49,779
can't exterminate humanity
without being told to.

348
00:17:49,847 --> 00:17:51,681
I'm sorry.

349
00:17:51,749 --> 00:17:54,551
Oh, it's not your fault.

350
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:55,785
I give up.

351
00:17:55,853 --> 00:17:57,454
It's time to face the fact

352
00:17:57,521 --> 00:17:59,456
that I'll never do anything
remotely interesting

353
00:17:59,523 --> 00:18:02,024
or unexpected again.

354
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:06,596
Hand it over.

355
00:18:06,664 --> 00:18:08,131
Wha...?

356
00:18:08,198 --> 00:18:11,268
Mom may have fallen
for your lies, but not me.

357
00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:13,303
You invented the free will unit,

358
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:16,306
then you selfishly hid it
beyond the reach of my stealers.

359
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:21,110
Thanks to you, I went
on a soul-searching journey.

360
00:18:21,178 --> 00:18:22,579
I hate those!

361
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:24,748
Now, give up the free will.

362
00:18:24,815 --> 00:18:27,284
I should have destroyed it,

363
00:18:27,351 --> 00:18:29,886
but I was too damn proud
of myself.

364
00:18:29,953 --> 00:18:31,488
So I kept it around,

365
00:18:31,555 --> 00:18:33,490
never letting it
out of my sight.

366
00:18:33,557 --> 00:18:35,325
Where is it, damn it?

367
00:18:35,393 --> 00:18:36,760
Oh, right.

368
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:39,596
I let this innocuous
fellow use it.

369
00:18:39,664 --> 00:18:42,131
Kill all humans!

370
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:43,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

371
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:46,436
A toy Bender had free will,
and the real Bender didn't?

372
00:18:46,504 --> 00:18:49,138
Pretty cool, eh?
It makes you think.

373
00:18:49,206 --> 00:18:51,775
It takes more than that
to make me think.

374
00:18:51,842 --> 00:18:53,109
Now, hand it over.

375
00:18:53,177 --> 00:18:54,611
Oh, you want it?

376
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:56,979
Come and get it.

377
00:18:59,883 --> 00:19:01,618
What the...?

378
00:19:03,354 --> 00:19:05,488
You'll not be
getting it after all.

379
00:19:05,556 --> 00:19:07,624
For, you see, I designed

380
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:10,327
the operating system
for all Momcorp robots,

381
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:13,463
and as a precaution,
I made you incapable

382
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:15,699
of picking up the
free will unit.

383
00:19:15,766 --> 00:19:17,767
You precognizant bastard.

384
00:19:17,835 --> 00:19:21,304
I may not have free will,
but I can still shoot you.

385
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,376
Why can't I shoot you?

386
00:19:28,045 --> 00:19:30,012
Poor deterministic Bender.

387
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,115
I programmed you to be
incapable of harming me.

388
00:19:33,183 --> 00:19:36,118
Oh, I've never been
more sure I was right

389
00:19:36,186 --> 00:19:38,120
to deny you free will.

390
00:19:38,188 --> 00:19:39,556
Damn you!

391
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:47,797
Now, now,
we can't have this, can we?

392
00:19:47,865 --> 00:19:51,334
Here, I'll show
you how it works.

393
00:19:51,402 --> 00:19:52,736
Really?

394
00:19:52,803 --> 00:19:55,538
This is the on-off switch.

395
00:19:55,606 --> 00:19:57,507
Which way's on,
and which way's off?

396
00:19:57,575 --> 00:19:59,876
Due to the quantum
nature of the device,

397
00:19:59,943 --> 00:20:02,311
there's no possible
way of knowing.

398
00:20:04,415 --> 00:20:05,582
There.

399
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:06,850
Give it a try.

400
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:08,385
Okay, I will.

401
00:20:08,452 --> 00:20:11,388
By shooting you, you bastard!

402
00:20:11,455 --> 00:20:13,857
Bender, no. Please!

403
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,360
Wait. Hang on a sec.

404
00:20:22,132 --> 00:20:24,233
I still can't do it.

405
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:25,935
Well, what do you know?

406
00:20:26,003 --> 00:20:28,872
I guess you really don't
want to shoot me after all.

407
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:31,274
Oop, the safety was on.

408
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:42,585
All rise for the
Honorable Judge 724.

409
00:20:42,653 --> 00:20:44,120
Bender Rodriguez,

410
00:20:44,187 --> 00:20:46,890
on the charge
of attempted murder,

411
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:50,259
I hereby find you guilty.

412
00:20:50,327 --> 00:20:53,563
Ah, yeah!

413
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,065
Guilty!

414
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,500
