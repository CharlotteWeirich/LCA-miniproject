Hello, sun, how's it going?

25
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:36,406
You know, it's a big day.
Could be our last.

26
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,490
[Rayla] Yeah.

27
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,869
To be fair, that's true every day.

Okay, but to be even more fair,
it's not every day

29

that you get attacked by an army

Rayla, if today is our last day,
I want you to know...

Hey, guys!

32
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,435
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!

00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,187
Time for the battle meeting! Ding-ding.

34
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,280
So, like, I wanna say something to you.

35
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,283
You know all those times
I called you the step prince,

36
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,494
or made fun of you,
or knocked you down and stuff?

37
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,623
- You remember that?
- I do. I do remember that.

38
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,583
Well, I'm sorry.

39
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,669
It was wrong and I'm sorry for it.

40
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,421
I think it was because

41
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,882
even though the king was your stepdad,
it was...

42
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,551
it was so clear how much he loved you,

43
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:43,306
and that made me feel...
jealous and upset.

44
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,477
So, I picked on you,
because I didn't know any better.

45
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,396
Also because you're smaller and weaker.

46
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,191
Oh, thanks... I guess.

47
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,736
[chuckling] And slower... I forgot slower.

48
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:03,159
So, should we, like, hug or something?
You know, to seal the apology?

49
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,243
Is that a thing?

50
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,872
Uh, I don't know if that's necessary... Oh!

I am proud of you, Claudia.

53
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,481
Despite everything,
you have stood beside me.

54
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:38,027
[laughs] Well, of course.
You're my dad, Dad.

55

I know, it's just...

56
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:44,200
You have grown up so brilliant and strong.

57
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,537
But you are still my little girl.

58
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:53,584
We're all that's left of our family,
and I won't let anything break us apart.

59
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,343
[Aaravos] When you capture the dragonling,
I will show you how to take his power,

60
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,472
how to imbue yourself
with all his magic and potential,

61
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:10,685
so that you will transcend
the limits of your human form.

62
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:14,939
Then none will dare stand against you.

"We have one objective today,
protect the Dragon Prince."

At any cost.

65
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,959
The forces of Lux Aurea
will fight bravely,

66
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,711

"We will be outnumbered,
but their forces are vicious and sloppy.

69
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,678
So, what happens if some break through?

70
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,222
"That's when our natural advantage
comes into play.

they'll be vulnerable,

and they've brought back my baby,

331
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,668
my love,

332
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,047
and my hope.

333
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,224
[Bait croaks]

334
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,316
[water dripping]

335
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,445
[gasps]

336
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,781
[groans] What...

337
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,408
What... what's going on?

338
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,040
[gasps] You're alive!

339
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,170
Somehow, I...

340
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,298
I survived the fall?

341
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:46,010
No. You didn't.

342
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,850
[gasps]

343
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,645
But... you're okay now.

344
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,317
Where is...

345
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,403
Your creepy caterpillar friend?

346
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:09,158
[chuckles] Two days ago it climbed up
that wall, and spun itself... into that.

347
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,078
It's changing.
