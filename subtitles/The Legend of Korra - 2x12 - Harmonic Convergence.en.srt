1
00:00:01,049 --> 00:00:03,025
Earth...

2
00:00:03,027 --> 00:00:04,760
Fire...

3
00:00:04,762 --> 00:00:06,229
Air...

4
00:00:06,231 --> 00:00:08,564
Water.

5
00:00:08,566 --> 00:00:12,618
Only the Avatar
can master all four elements

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,105
and bring balance to the world.

8
00:00:20,777 --> 00:00:22,278
Unalaq has forced Korra

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,796
into opening
the northern portal

10
00:00:23,798 --> 00:00:25,414
and trapped Jinora
in the spirit world.

11
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,133
Back in Republic City,

12
00:00:27,135 --> 00:00:28,968
everybody loves Varrick's
Nuktuk movers.

13
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,087
Everybody, that is,
except Mako,

14
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:33,622
whose pursuit of Varrick
has landed him in the slammer.

15
00:00:33,624 --> 00:00:35,424
And in the Southern
water tribe,

16
00:00:35,426 --> 00:00:37,793
Unalaq's army is nearing victory
in the civil war.

17
00:00:37,795 --> 00:00:40,513
But Tonraq isn't about
to give up without a fight.

18
00:00:53,328 --> 00:00:54,810
Dad's back!

19
00:01:00,284 --> 00:01:02,201
Where's Jinora?

20
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:08,090
No!

21
00:01:10,493 --> 00:01:13,662
Her spirit is trapped
in the spirit world,

22
00:01:13,664 --> 00:01:15,548
but she's going
to be all right.

23
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,851
- How could this happen?
- It was all my fault.

24
00:01:18,853 --> 00:01:21,053
I should have never let Jinora

25
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:22,521
enter the spirit world
without me.

26
00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:23,839
I couldn't protect her.

27
00:01:23,841 --> 00:01:25,558
I'm so sorry, Pema.

28
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,060
I tried to save her,
but Unalaq tricked me.

29
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:30,529
Don't worry, honey,
I'm not going to stop

30
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:34,617
until our little girl
is back safe with us.

31
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:42,708
You've got a visitor.

32
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,877
- Hey, Mako.
- Hey.

33
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,495
What's with the fancy duds?

34
00:01:46,497 --> 00:01:47,880
I'm on my way to the big finale

35
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:49,749
<i>Hero of the South.</i>

36
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:51,667
Yeah, everyone's
gonna be there,

37
00:01:51,669 --> 00:01:55,204
except for, you know, you...

38
00:01:55,206 --> 00:01:57,006
Because you're in jail
and stuff.

39
00:01:57,008 --> 00:01:58,391
Thanks for the reminder.

40
00:01:58,393 --> 00:01:59,892
Hey, I brought you something.

41
00:01:59,894 --> 00:02:01,761
I thought this would
brighten up your new place.

42
00:02:01,763 --> 00:02:03,179
Read the inscription.

43
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:08,434
"Dear Mako, Nuktuk says,
'keep smiling.'"

44
00:02:08,436 --> 00:02:10,486
did you come by
just to give me a poster?

45
00:02:10,488 --> 00:02:15,491
No, I came by
to give you my sincere,

46
00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:17,526
heartfelt words
of encouragement.

47
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:19,111
I know our lives
have been moving

48
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:21,563
in two different directions,
but I want you to know

49
00:02:21,565 --> 00:02:23,332
that I will always
be there for you.

50
00:02:23,334 --> 00:02:25,084
We are brothers, after all,

51
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:26,953
even if one of us is a member
of high society

52
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:27,954
and the other one
is a criminal.

53
00:02:27,956 --> 00:02:29,288
I am not a criminal!

54
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,090
Of course <i>I</i> know that,

55
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:33,209
but you do kinda look like one,

56
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:35,962
'cause you're in a jail,
and that's where criminals live.

57
00:02:35,964 --> 00:02:37,296
I was set up!

58
00:02:37,298 --> 00:02:39,932
Varrick knew I had figured out
he was hiring gangsters

59
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:42,268
to pose as northern soldiers
to get Republic City

60
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,853
to join the war.

61
00:02:43,855 --> 00:02:45,587
That's why he had me arrested.

62
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:47,690
Ah, I see what you're doing.

63
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:49,892
You're going for
the insanity defense.

64
00:02:49,894 --> 00:02:51,694
Smart.
No!

65
00:02:51,696 --> 00:02:54,563
I'm trying to tell you that
Varrick isn't what he seems.

66
00:02:54,565 --> 00:02:56,532
Where's Asami?
She'll listen to me.

67
00:02:56,534 --> 00:02:57,566
I asked her to come,

68
00:02:57,568 --> 00:02:59,151
but she said
it was too hard for her.

69
00:02:59,153 --> 00:03:00,903
You being in jail like this

70
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:04,206
reminds her of her dad.

71
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,275
Okay, gotta run,
but I'll be back tomorrow.

72
00:03:06,277 --> 00:03:08,327
And I am gonna get you
the best attorney

73
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:10,579
fame and fortune can buy.

74
00:03:10,581 --> 00:03:11,947
Bolin, wait.

75
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:14,050
If my theory about Varrick
is right,

76
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:16,469
something might go down tonight
at your premiere.

77
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:18,120
Promise me you'll
keep your eyes peeled.

78
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:19,889
Yeah, okay, big brother.

79
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:21,457
I promise.

80
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,394
Whew! That insanity defense
is definitely gonna work.

81
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,268
Should we wait another day?

82
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,636
Korra still might come
with reinforcements.

83
00:03:34,638 --> 00:03:36,489
We can't wait any longer.

84
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:39,275
It's time we take back
what is ours!

85
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:41,494
It's time to take back
our city!

86
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:07,353
Say "Nuktuk."

87
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:11,273
There they are, folks,

88
00:04:11,275 --> 00:04:13,192
the sweethearts
of the big screen,

89
00:04:13,194 --> 00:04:16,195
and Republic City's
most famous couple,

90
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:18,697
Bolin and ginger.

91
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:21,183
Let me get a picture.

92
00:04:21,185 --> 00:04:23,519
Wow, that was fun.

93
00:04:23,521 --> 00:04:24,853
And did you hear
what Shiro said?

94
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:27,456
We're Republic City's
most famous couple.

95
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,958
Bolin, you're a doll,

96
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,078
but you're as dumb
as the rocks you bend.

97
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,029
We are not a couple.

98
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:35,915
That's not what Shiro said.

99
00:04:39,553 --> 00:04:41,887
Stop stuffing your moustaches
with varri-cakes

100
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:43,172
and get to your post!

101
00:04:43,174 --> 00:04:44,590
You got it, boss.

102
00:04:44,592 --> 00:04:46,759
You two are the pinnacle
of refinement.

103
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:49,011
This star-studded event
just keeps getting

104
00:04:49,013 --> 00:04:50,729
star-studdier, folks.

105
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:52,381
President Raiko
and the first lady,

106
00:04:52,383 --> 00:04:54,400
buttercup Raiko, just arrived.

107
00:04:54,402 --> 00:04:56,819
And they're being greeted
by entrepreneur extraordinaire,

108
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:58,053
Varrick.

109
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:01,690
There they are,
my two most honored guests.

110
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:03,892
Mwah!
What do you think?

111
00:05:03,894 --> 00:05:06,278
No expense has been spared.

112
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,747
I brought in the finest
entertainers from ba sing se

113
00:05:08,749 --> 00:05:10,699
and the best food
from around the world.

114
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:12,234
Heck, I even
had this red carpet

115
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:14,003
imported from the fire nation.

116
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:17,072
They make the best red stuff
over there.

117
00:05:17,074 --> 00:05:21,594
In fact...
all right, picture time!

118
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:23,712
Varrick, you didn't
have to do all this for us.

119
00:05:23,714 --> 00:05:25,464
I wanted to.

120
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:28,300
Mr. President,
I took one look at your wife,

121
00:05:28,302 --> 00:05:32,421
and I knew that you
were a man of exquisite taste.

122
00:05:32,423 --> 00:05:35,391
And that's why I know
you're gonna love this mover!

123
00:05:35,393 --> 00:05:37,226
Varrick,
I know what you're doing,

124
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:40,029
and I doubt your propaganda
is going to change my mind

125
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:42,364
about going to war
with the northern water tribe.

126
00:05:42,366 --> 00:05:44,567
Oh, I think you'll be surprised

127
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:47,703
how persuasive I can be.

128
00:06:00,783 --> 00:06:03,052
Thank you all
for coming to the finale

129
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:06,338
<i>Hero of the South.</i>

130
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,474
You know, when I first
started this project,

131
00:06:08,476 --> 00:06:10,976
there were a lot
of naysayers out there.

132
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:13,312
"You can't make pictures move,"
they said.

133
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:15,431
"You can't take
some knucklehead earthbender

134
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:17,966
and make him a star,"
they said.

135
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:21,187
"You can't teach a polar bear
dog to speak," they said.

136
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:23,822
Well, they're wrong.

137
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:25,824
Thanks to the magic
of the movers,

138
00:06:25,826 --> 00:06:28,027
our furry friends
have found their voices.

139
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:32,414
And you'll be shocked to hear
what they have to say.

140
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,867
They speak of the injustice
that's happening

141
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:37,319
in the Southern water tribe
right now.

142
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:42,157
My hope is that their words
and this epic mover

143
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,760
will inspire
a real-life hero

144
00:06:44,762 --> 00:06:48,964
to rise up and help.

145
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:52,434
Thank you again.
Enjoy the show.

146
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:56,388
When last we left our hero,

147
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,507
be was captured
by the evil Unalaq's

148
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:00,025
dastardly pet bird.

149
00:07:00,027 --> 00:07:02,695
Amazingly, with the power
of his whistling,

150
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:03,812
Nuktuk escaped...

151
00:07:08,486 --> 00:07:10,986
And decided
to seek out counsel.

152
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,990
Thank you, wise sage.

153
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:17,192
I will travel to Republic City
and seek help.

154
00:07:20,197 --> 00:07:22,498
Have a seat.

155
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,551
I'm just working on a cure
for the common cold.

156
00:07:25,553 --> 00:07:28,637
No longer will my citizens
suffer from the sniffles.

157
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,723
Mr. President, there's
something more important

158
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:32,141
than the sniffles right now.

159
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:35,060
I need your help
to stop the evil Unalaq.

160
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:37,062
Did you say "help"?

161
00:07:37,064 --> 00:07:39,315
If there is one thing
I love doing,

162
00:07:39,317 --> 00:07:41,066
it's helping people.

163
00:07:41,068 --> 00:07:43,552
The seal line
seemed a bit far-fetched,

164
00:07:43,554 --> 00:07:45,187
but the portrayal
of this president

165
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:48,107
is right on the money.

166
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:53,078
I think this
is your best mover yet.

167
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,614
I just wish Mako
was here to see it.

168
00:08:12,248 --> 00:08:16,018
Mmm. I like to eat the top
off the varri-cake first.

169
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,853
I just try
to shove the whole thing

170
00:08:17,855 --> 00:08:20,022
in my mouth at once.

171
00:08:23,727 --> 00:08:26,228
I love our job.

172
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,564
Huh?

173
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:43,782
Northern water tribe
automatons!

174
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:45,667
Nooo!

175
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:49,821
Bee Bo bop,
Nuktuk cannot stop Unalaq.

176
00:08:49,823 --> 00:08:51,989
Must destroy Nuktuk.

177
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,667
Ha ha!

178
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:04,102
Aah!

179
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:08,473
Looks like you forgot
that water and automatons

180
00:09:08,475 --> 00:09:09,974
don't mix.

181
00:09:09,976 --> 00:09:11,776
Beep bop boo.

182
00:09:11,778 --> 00:09:16,447
Oh, no, circuits not working.

183
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:18,700
We did it!

184
00:09:18,702 --> 00:09:21,369
But wait.
Where's Juji?

185
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,689
Nukno!

186
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:28,293
You can't die, Juji.

187
00:09:28,295 --> 00:09:30,528
Not on my watch.

188
00:09:31,715 --> 00:09:33,998
It's okay, Nuktuk.

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,136
At least I got to be...

190
00:09:38,138 --> 00:09:42,473
Your friend.

191
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:47,428
Juji!

192
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:59,223
Are you okay?

193
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:02,277
It seems like this mover
is really getting to you.

194
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,395
You do know Juji's
not really dead?

195
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:07,165
Of course I know.
Juji's fine.

196
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:08,666
He comes back to life
in the end

197
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:11,169
when the doomsday device shifts
the polarity of the earth.

198
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:14,455
Oops. Spoiler.
Sorry.

199
00:10:14,457 --> 00:10:15,924
Then what's wrong?

200
00:10:15,926 --> 00:10:18,877
I guess I just miss my friends.

201
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:21,012
Everything is going
so well for me,

202
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:24,382
but it feels empty
without everyone around.

203
00:10:24,384 --> 00:10:27,518
Korra's gone, Mako's in jail,
you're doing...

204
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,138
Business lady stuff.

205
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,423
Team Avatar's fallen apart.

206
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:34,142
I know.

207
00:10:34,144 --> 00:10:37,946
Things have changed so much
since we first met.

208
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:40,114
Why don't you come back in

209
00:10:40,116 --> 00:10:41,699
and fish watching
the mover with me?

210
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:45,036
You go ahead.
I need another minute.

211
00:10:51,627 --> 00:10:53,711
That's weird.

212
00:11:00,336 --> 00:11:03,388
Whoa... ahh!

213
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,789
Ugh!

214
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,269
They're after the president!

215
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:25,743
You're too late, Nuktuk.

216
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:29,330
Soon, my doomsday device
will shoot this block of ice

217
00:11:29,332 --> 00:11:33,117
into the earth's core,
freezing the entire planet.

218
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:37,205
And I will be the ruler
of ice earth!

219
00:11:41,044 --> 00:11:44,295
I don't think so.

220
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:49,183
I don't think so!

221
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:52,687
Huh! Ha!

222
00:12:05,285 --> 00:12:08,686
Mr. President, get back!
I'm here to help.

223
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:21,966
Looks like there's
nowhere to go.

224
00:12:24,803 --> 00:12:27,338
Uhh!

225
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,590
Secure the president

226
00:12:29,592 --> 00:12:31,976
and call for backup
immediately!

227
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,611
Nuktuk, look out!
Bolin, look out!

228
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:04,425
Hyah!

229
00:13:06,095 --> 00:13:08,412
This is unbelievable!

230
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:10,131
Bolin is bending
two full stacks

231
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:13,217
of earth discs at once,
which would normally be illegal.

232
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:15,803
But then again, he's fighting
three waterbenders,

233
00:13:15,805 --> 00:13:17,688
so all rules
are out the window.

234
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:35,239
Tell me who sent you!

235
00:13:35,241 --> 00:13:37,542
It was Varrick.
Please don't hurt me, Nuktuk!

236
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:46,417
I think this
is our cue to exit.

237
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:50,287
Where do you think
you're going?

238
00:13:56,146 --> 00:13:58,062
It's a knockout!

239
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,032
They're falling back.

240
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:39,387
Varrick's plan
was to kidnap you

241
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:40,688
and blame it on the north.

242
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,773
Then Republic City
would have no choice

243
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:45,009
but to join the war
on the side of the South.

244
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:47,478
I can't believe Varrick
would do something like this,

245
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,646
and no one saw it coming.

246
00:14:48,648 --> 00:14:52,366
Actually, someone did.
Remember Mako?

247
00:14:52,368 --> 00:14:55,069
You've got a great officer
on your hands.

248
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:56,454
He's one of the best.

249
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:01,159
Mwah!

250
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:05,329
I can't believe my boyfriend
is a real-life hero.

251
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:07,498
Boyfriend?
Wait, stop.

252
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,834
I thought you said
we <i>weren't</i> a couple.

253
00:15:09,836 --> 00:15:12,637
You really are as dumb
as those rocks.

254
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,006
Of course we're a couple.

255
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:17,008
Bolin, you saved the president.

256
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,227
And you proved Mako
was right all along.

257
00:15:19,229 --> 00:15:20,394
We have to go tell him
what happened.

258
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:23,147
Yeah.

259
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:25,066
Oh, you meant right now.

260
00:15:29,021 --> 00:15:32,773
- President Raiko...
- Avatar Korra, what's wrong?

261
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:35,026
Sir, I know I've asked
for your help before,

262
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:36,560
but things have changed.

263
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:39,914
Unalaq doesn't just want
to take over the South anymore.

264
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,399
He wants to destroy
the whole world.

265
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,602
Unalaq is gonna
destroy the world?

266
00:15:49,604 --> 00:15:52,104
He really does have
a doomsday device?

267
00:15:52,106 --> 00:15:54,006
He's trying to release
a powerful dark spirit

268
00:15:54,008 --> 00:15:55,307
during harmonic convergence,

269
00:15:55,309 --> 00:15:57,309
which is only a few days away.

270
00:15:57,311 --> 00:16:01,447
If he succeeds, the world
as we know it is over.

271
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:03,582
Sir, we desperately
need your help.

272
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:08,487
I'm sorry, Korra,
but my answer is still no.

273
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:10,890
There are lives on the line!

274
00:16:10,892 --> 00:16:12,424
And my daughter is one of them.

275
00:16:12,426 --> 00:16:14,894
Raiko, you must reconsider.

276
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:16,929
I'm aware that lives
are on the line,

277
00:16:16,931 --> 00:16:19,531
and that's precisely why
my troops are staying here.

278
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:21,533
If the world is going
to be thrown into chaos,

279
00:16:21,535 --> 00:16:24,270
like you claim,
I need to protect my citizens.

280
00:16:24,272 --> 00:16:26,071
I'm sorry.
Sir...

281
00:16:26,073 --> 00:16:27,740
Nuktuk needs your help.

282
00:16:27,742 --> 00:16:30,576
I know you love helping people.

283
00:16:30,578 --> 00:16:33,045
Son, I appreciate you
saving my life,

284
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:34,413
and I'm a big fan of your work,

285
00:16:34,415 --> 00:16:37,249
but my decision is final.

286
00:16:39,586 --> 00:16:41,020
I never should have saved
that guy.

287
00:16:41,022 --> 00:16:43,122
If you guys need help,
I'm here for you.

288
00:16:43,124 --> 00:16:44,256
Yeah, me too.

289
00:16:44,258 --> 00:16:45,524
Thank you.

290
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:48,394
It's so good
to see you guys again.

291
00:16:48,396 --> 00:16:49,662
Wait, where's Mako?

292
00:16:54,734 --> 00:16:56,802
So how was the big premiere?

293
00:16:56,804 --> 00:17:00,105
I saved the president!
In real life!

294
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:01,573
Wait, what?

295
00:17:01,575 --> 00:17:03,042
You were right about Varrick.

296
00:17:03,044 --> 00:17:04,710
He tried to kidnap Raiko!

297
00:17:04,712 --> 00:17:06,145
I knew it.

298
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:07,613
But it didn't work,
because of you.

299
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:08,914
And because of me.

300
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,749
Let's just say
we both did good.

301
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:13,686
Beifong says you're free to go.

302
00:17:14,788 --> 00:17:16,488
Sorry for ever
doubting you, Mako.

303
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,857
Don't worry about it, bro.

304
00:17:29,185 --> 00:17:30,736
Nice job, Mako.

305
00:17:30,738 --> 00:17:32,855
You're going to make
a great Detective.

306
00:17:32,857 --> 00:17:35,774
But, chief, there aren't any
Detective openings right now.

307
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:38,744
Actually, we have two openings.

308
00:17:45,585 --> 00:17:46,869
Mwah.

309
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:49,254
Mako, I missed you so much.

310
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,543
Oh, yeah, did I forget
to tell you?

311
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:55,761
Korra's back.

312
00:17:55,763 --> 00:17:59,465
Korra, hey, I missed you too.

313
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:00,999
So you're not still mad at me?

314
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:02,518
Why would I be mad?

315
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,838
We had that fight
before you left, remember?

316
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,441
No, not really.

317
00:18:09,443 --> 00:18:11,510
I got attacked
by a dark spirit,

318
00:18:11,512 --> 00:18:13,395
and I lost my memory
for a little while.

319
00:18:13,397 --> 00:18:16,115
Maybe it hasn't
all come back yet.

320
00:18:16,117 --> 00:18:17,616
Was it a bad fight?

321
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:20,536
Uh...

322
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:24,356
Mm... No.

323
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:27,376
No, it...
it wasn't that bad.

324
00:18:31,716 --> 00:18:33,916
Korra, we don't have much time.

325
00:18:33,918 --> 00:18:36,701
We need to figure out
how to deal with Unalaq.

326
00:18:36,703 --> 00:18:39,972
I think I know
just the man to talk to.

327
00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:44,843
Guys, hey!
What do you think?

328
00:18:44,845 --> 00:18:46,512
Varrick industries
built this prison,

329
00:18:46,514 --> 00:18:48,713
and I had this cell
made special.

330
00:18:48,715 --> 00:18:51,550
I had a feeling
I'd end up here one day.

331
00:18:51,552 --> 00:18:54,153
Zhu Li, come on!
We got guests.

332
00:18:54,155 --> 00:18:56,605
Whip up a pot
of that green tea I love.

333
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:58,056
Yes, sir.

334
00:18:58,058 --> 00:18:59,742
Zhu Li's in prison with you?

335
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:01,493
Of course.
I don't go anywhere

336
00:19:01,495 --> 00:19:03,245
without my assistant.
Do you?

337
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:04,663
We're not interested
in your tea,

338
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:05,864
and this isn't
a friendly visit.

339
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:07,732
Don't tell me you guys
are still mad

340
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:09,401
about everything that happened.

341
00:19:09,403 --> 00:19:11,537
I did some good things too.

342
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:14,173
Korra, who warned you
about Unalaq?

343
00:19:14,175 --> 00:19:15,424
I did.

344
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:17,843
Bolin, who got you
into the movers?

345
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:18,927
I did.

346
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:20,912
Asami, who saved your company?

347
00:19:20,914 --> 00:19:22,381
I did.

348
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:24,516
Mako, who got you
thrown in jail?

349
00:19:24,518 --> 00:19:25,634
I did!

350
00:19:25,636 --> 00:19:27,219
Oh, yeah, I guess
that was a bad thing.

351
00:19:27,221 --> 00:19:29,054
You stole everything from me,

352
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:30,722
and you tried to kidnap
the president.

353
00:19:30,724 --> 00:19:31,890
Those are pretty bad too.

354
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:33,642
I wasn't going to hurt him.

355
00:19:33,644 --> 00:19:35,811
I just needed to start a war.

356
00:19:35,813 --> 00:19:37,029
Well, a bigger war.

357
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:38,280
Well, we're gonna end it.

358
00:19:38,282 --> 00:19:40,149
Where's all the stuff
you stole from Asami?

359
00:19:40,151 --> 00:19:42,701
The future industries stuff?
It's on my battleship.

360
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:44,486
You have a battleship?

361
00:19:44,488 --> 00:19:45,937
Of course I do!

362
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:47,706
I bought the first one
they made,

363
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,459
named her the <i>Zhu Li.</i>

364
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:53,912
You named your battleship
after your assistant?

365
00:19:53,914 --> 00:19:57,666
Yep. They're both cold,
heartless war machines.

366
00:19:57,668 --> 00:20:00,619
Your tea, sir.

367
00:20:00,621 --> 00:20:03,338
Look, I am truly sorry
for the mess I caused.

368
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,926
Let me make it up to you.
Take <i>Zhu Li.</i>

369
00:20:07,928 --> 00:20:11,230
My battleship, it's yours,
and everything on it.

370
00:20:11,232 --> 00:20:13,348
It's not the fleet
we were looking for,

371
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,966
but it's the next best thing.

372
00:20:14,968 --> 00:20:16,268
All right!

373
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,070
Team Avatar is back
in business!

374
00:20:26,663 --> 00:20:30,415
It's okay.
We're gonna stop Unalaq

375
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:32,034
and get Jinora back.

376
00:20:32,036 --> 00:20:35,871
I hope my dad's all right.

377
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:37,206
I'm sure he's fine.

378
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,524
Get the men and fall back.

379
00:20:55,526 --> 00:20:58,443
What about you?

380
00:21:02,482 --> 00:21:05,284
I'm going to end this
right now.

381
00:21:05,286 --> 00:21:07,369
Go!

382
00:21:17,714 --> 00:21:20,699
Hello, Tonraq.
Looking for me?

383
00:21:31,311 --> 00:21:34,229
Brother,
I'm too strong for you.

384
00:21:34,231 --> 00:21:36,982
You're no brother of mine.
You betrayed me.

385
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:38,567
You had me banished.

386
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:42,237
Yes, I did.

387
00:21:46,777 --> 00:21:49,611
Stop!
He's mine.

388
00:21:51,063 --> 00:21:53,031
You are not the true chief.

389
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:56,568
I am.
And you will bow to me.

390
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:01,800
Now that I've defeated you,

391
00:23:01,802 --> 00:23:04,803
your daughter is next.

392
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,633
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by</font> <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

393
00:23:46,376 --> 00:23:48,210
What's up with the coat?

394
00:23:48,212 --> 00:23:49,995
And where did you get that pie?

395
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:51,714
It's a Varrick ship.

396
00:23:51,716 --> 00:23:53,549
You never know
what you're gonna find.

397
00:23:53,551 --> 00:23:55,701
There's a whole level
filled with funhouse mirrors.

398
00:23:55,703 --> 00:23:58,870
Of course,
there's also the cat-gator deck.

399
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:01,724
I miss that guy.

400
00:24:01,726 --> 00:24:04,677
He really knew how to make
a long trip interesting.

401
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,712
So have you told Korra yet

402
00:24:06,714 --> 00:24:08,063
about how you guys broke up
and then you

403
00:24:08,065 --> 00:24:09,765
kind of started dating Asami
while she was off

404
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:11,517
getting attacked
by dark spirits?

405
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:12,718
You wanna keep it down?

406
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,020
I'm waiting
for the right moment.

407
00:24:15,022 --> 00:24:16,655
Oh, Mako.

408
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:19,158
You know, a wise man once
told me that delivering bad news

409
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,727
to a girlfriend was like ripping
off a blood-sucking leech.

410
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:24,496
You just have to do it fast
and get it over with.

411
00:24:24,498 --> 00:24:27,249
I hate it when you listen to me.

412
00:24:27,251 --> 00:24:28,701
Fine.

413
00:24:28,703 --> 00:24:30,336
Unalaq will be waiting for you.

414
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:32,955
You'll need all of
your Avatar power to stop him.

415
00:24:32,957 --> 00:24:34,906
I'm going to close
the spirit portals,

416
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:37,760
lock Vaatu in
for another 10,000 years,

417
00:24:37,762 --> 00:24:41,180
and make Unalaq wish
he'd never been born!

418
00:24:53,476 --> 00:24:54,593
Thanks, Mako.

419
00:24:54,595 --> 00:24:57,696
Uh... Um...

420
00:24:57,698 --> 00:24:59,064
Did you want something?

421
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:02,701
Uh, no, no, nothing.

422
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,941
As soon as we reach
the Southern water tribe,

423
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:12,461
we'll blast through the blockade
at the main port.

424
00:25:12,463 --> 00:25:15,214
Then we can rendezvous
with Tonraq and his troops,

425
00:25:15,216 --> 00:25:17,282
crash through the defenses
around the portal,

426
00:25:17,284 --> 00:25:19,218
and enter the spirit world.

427
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,620
Whoa, since when
does my little brother

428
00:25:21,622 --> 00:25:23,806
want to crash or blast
through anything?

429
00:25:23,808 --> 00:25:26,759
I'll do whatever it takes
to save my daughter.

430
00:25:26,761 --> 00:25:28,761
We all want to save Jinora,

431
00:25:28,763 --> 00:25:31,764
but I think your plan
might be a tad overaggressive,

432
00:25:31,766 --> 00:25:34,650
seeing as there are
only seven of us and one ship.

433
00:25:34,652 --> 00:25:36,802
Really?
And what do you suggest?

434
00:25:36,804 --> 00:25:40,072
An attack like this
calls for strategy.

435
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:42,608
I remember when I was surrounded
by pirates

436
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,476
in the hurricane straits.

437
00:25:44,478 --> 00:25:46,278
We managed to capture them all

438
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,498
with just a feather, two eggs,
and a barrel of molasses.

439
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,867
I don't want to hear
any of your crazy stories now.

440
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:55,487
This is serious.

441
00:25:55,489 --> 00:25:58,841
- Are we almost there?
- Almost.

442
00:25:58,843 --> 00:26:01,760
But I just picked up
a distress signal

443
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:02,845
from the Southern troops.

444
00:26:02,847 --> 00:26:04,496
There's a problem.

445
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:20,312
Mom!

446
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:24,116
I'm so happy you're here.

447
00:26:24,118 --> 00:26:26,568
Where's dad?

448
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,238
Unalaq wiped out
the entire Southern resistance

449
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,740
and captured your father.

450
00:26:31,742 --> 00:26:33,909
I'll get him back.

451
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:35,127
Where is my mother?

452
00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:37,246
She's in the healing hut.

453
00:26:37,248 --> 00:26:39,665
So many injured.

454
00:26:51,428 --> 00:26:52,895
What happened?

455
00:26:52,897 --> 00:26:55,647
Her soul is trapped
in the spirit world.

456
00:26:55,649 --> 00:26:58,884
Oh, my goodness.
How long has she been away?

457
00:26:58,886 --> 00:27:00,552
Almost a week.

458
00:27:00,554 --> 00:27:02,154
I've tried to keep
her energy flowing,

459
00:27:02,156 --> 00:27:04,273
but I can feel her
slipping away.

460
00:27:04,275 --> 00:27:08,393
You're the only one
who can help her now, mom.

461
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:18,036
How much longer
can she survive like this?

462
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:20,038
I don't know.

463
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,593
But she's very strong
to have lasted this long.

464
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:27,346
I talked to the rebels.

465
00:27:27,348 --> 00:27:29,581
They said Unalaq's got
the Southern portal surrounded.

466
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:32,050
Harmonic convergence
is only a few hours away.

467
00:27:32,052 --> 00:27:34,436
Then we have to break through
the enemy lines ourselves

468
00:27:34,438 --> 00:27:35,921
and get to the portal now.

469
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:37,723
There's no use
in talking anymore.

470
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:39,274
We know what our mission is.

471
00:27:39,276 --> 00:27:41,393
A suicide mission.

472
00:27:41,395 --> 00:27:45,447
You know, I was
in a similar situation once.

473
00:27:45,449 --> 00:27:47,282
My platoon had crawled
through the desert

474
00:27:47,284 --> 00:27:48,867
with no water for a week,

475
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:52,988
but when we finally located
the only oasis for 100 Miles,

476
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,158
it was surrounded
by angry sandbenders.

477
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,044
I realized our only chance
to get to the water

478
00:27:59,046 --> 00:28:01,630
was to drop in from above.

479
00:28:01,632 --> 00:28:03,615
So I fashioned together
a catapult,

480
00:28:03,617 --> 00:28:06,218
and with the help of
a few well-trained hog-monkeys...

481
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,387
enough of your ridiculous lies.

482
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:10,255
Can't you see
that the fate of the world

483
00:28:10,257 --> 00:28:12,958
and Jinora's life depends
on what we do here today?

484
00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:16,061
Hold on.
Maybe Bumi's right.

485
00:28:16,063 --> 00:28:18,564
We don't have a catapult
and hog-monkeys,

486
00:28:18,566 --> 00:28:19,965
but we have a flying bison,

487
00:28:19,967 --> 00:28:21,817
and there's a plane
on Varrick's ship.

488
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:23,802
Maybe we can attack from above.

489
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:24,903
What are you thinking?

490
00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:26,805
Mako, Bolin, and I
can use the plane

491
00:28:26,807 --> 00:28:28,157
to create a distraction

492
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,975
and scatter
some of the defenses.

493
00:28:29,977 --> 00:28:31,977
You, Tenzin, Bumi,
and Kya can fly

494
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:36,114
into the spirit portal on Oogi
when you see an opening.

495
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:38,033
T's get moving.

496
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:58,437
What are we still doing here,
father?

497
00:28:58,439 --> 00:29:01,390
The invasion
was completely successful,

498
00:29:01,392 --> 00:29:03,976
and the Southern tribe
is under our control.

499
00:29:03,978 --> 00:29:05,811
The spirit portals are open.

500
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:08,680
You've restored balance.
Now we would like to go home.

501
00:29:08,682 --> 00:29:11,316
You don't understand.

502
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:14,653
Everything I've achieved so far
will pale in comparison

503
00:29:14,655 --> 00:29:16,205
with what
I'm about to accomplish.

504
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:19,374
What else is there?
The water tribe is united.

505
00:29:19,376 --> 00:29:22,211
After today, there will be
no more water tribe,

506
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:24,329
no more nations of any kind.

507
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:26,698
The world
is about to be transformed

508
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,551
into something magnificent
and new,

509
00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:34,256
and I will lead
this glorious revolution.

510
00:29:34,258 --> 00:29:36,041
Now go outside
and get the troops ready

511
00:29:36,043 --> 00:29:37,392
to defend the spirit portal.

512
00:29:37,394 --> 00:29:40,762
From whom?
We've already beaten everyone.

513
00:29:40,764 --> 00:29:43,015
The Avatar will be here soon.

514
00:29:43,017 --> 00:29:44,933
She has no choice.

515
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:00,899
Are you ready?

516
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:03,418
I'm an earthbender
strapped to the wing of a plane

517
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,872
hundreds of feet in the air,
so no.

518
00:30:06,874 --> 00:30:10,259
Don't worry. There's no way
they'll be expecting this.

519
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:21,920
I think they were expecting it.

520
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:49,705
Asami!

521
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,725
Get ready.

522
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,219
Fire!

523
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,183
There are spirits everywhere.

524
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:35,584
I don't see an opening.

525
00:31:35,586 --> 00:31:38,137
Let's circle around
and see if we can find a way in

526
00:31:38,139 --> 00:31:40,472
from the other side.

527
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,393
Hold on!

528
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:02,745
The spirits are weighing
Oogi down.

529
00:32:02,747 --> 00:32:04,630
We're losing altitude.

530
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:08,834
Get off of him, you sticky,
nasty, little blob of goo!

531
00:32:08,836 --> 00:32:09,885
Whoa!

532
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:12,621
If I go, you're coming with me.

533
00:32:12,623 --> 00:32:15,591
Aah!

534
00:32:15,593 --> 00:32:17,343
Bumi!

535
00:32:50,794 --> 00:32:53,762
I wish Varrick
was filming this.

536
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:57,383
We could call it
<i>Sky warrior.</i>

537
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:14,683
Brace yourselves.

538
00:33:52,355 --> 00:33:54,606
Dad.

539
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:59,778
Korra, I'm so sorry.

540
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,413
I failed you.

541
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:03,782
Don't give up.

542
00:34:03,784 --> 00:34:05,834
Harmonic convergence
isn't here yet.

543
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:08,087
We still have a chance.

544
00:34:14,711 --> 00:34:16,345
We tried.

545
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:20,466
Congratulations, everyone.

546
00:34:20,468 --> 00:34:21,967
You've all got
front-row seats

547
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:23,969
for the beginning
of the new world order.

548
00:34:23,971 --> 00:34:26,805
You don't know
what you're doing, Unalaq.

549
00:34:26,807 --> 00:34:28,974
Freeing Vaatu
won't make you powerful.

550
00:34:28,976 --> 00:34:31,426
It will only make you a traitor
to everything good

551
00:34:31,428 --> 00:34:33,695
that's happened
for the last 10,000 years.

552
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:36,648
You think what Avatar wan
did was good?

553
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,735
Driving almost all the spirits
from this world?

554
00:34:39,737 --> 00:34:43,622
The Avatar hasn't brought
balance, only chaos.

555
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:46,041
You call yourself the bridge
between the two worlds,

556
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:48,210
but there shouldn't be
a bridge.

557
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:50,278
We should live together as one.

558
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,713
Even if Vaatu escapes,

559
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:54,333
I'll put him right back
in his prison,

560
00:34:54,335 --> 00:34:55,884
just like Wan did.

561
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:58,053
It's true that,
when Wan fused with Raava,

562
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:00,556
he tipped the scales
in her favor.

563
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:03,425
But this time, I'll be here
to level the playing field.

564
00:35:03,427 --> 00:35:06,011
When harmonic convergence comes,

565
00:35:06,013 --> 00:35:08,564
I will fuse with Vaatu.

566
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:10,849
And together, we will become
the new Avatar.

567
00:35:10,851 --> 00:35:14,403
A dark Avatar.

568
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:16,488
Your era is over.

569
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,241
Think about what you're doing.

570
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:21,994
I know that you've always had
a deep connection

571
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:26,365
with the spirits,
but you're still a man.

572
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:28,149
You're still my brother.

573
00:35:28,151 --> 00:35:30,335
You're Eska and Desna's father.

574
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,588
Are you willing
to throw your humanity away

575
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,673
to become a monster?

576
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:38,159
I'll be no more of a monster
than your own daughter.

577
00:35:38,161 --> 00:35:39,461
The only difference is that,

578
00:35:39,463 --> 00:35:42,681
while she can barely recognize
her own spiritual power,

579
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:45,000
I will be in complete alignment
with mine.

580
00:35:45,002 --> 00:35:47,168
Vaatu and I will be as one.

581
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:52,024
No one will be able
to stand against us.

582
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:53,392
Keep them locked up.

583
00:35:53,394 --> 00:35:55,677
After the harmonic convergence,

584
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:58,280
I will come for Korra.

585
00:35:58,282 --> 00:35:59,698
Yes, father.

586
00:36:03,403 --> 00:36:06,572
I failed in every way.

587
00:36:06,574 --> 00:36:08,457
We've lost Jinora forever.

588
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:11,960
There's still a chance.
They didn't get Bumi.

589
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:33,899
Oh, you want to play some more.

590
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:36,602
Well, bring it on.

591
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,929
Oh, we're playing dirty, huh?

592
00:37:29,156 --> 00:37:33,375
Hmm, looks like we've got
a music lover here.

593
00:37:42,502 --> 00:37:45,420
Reinforcements!

594
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,425
All right, soldiers.

595
00:37:50,427 --> 00:37:53,294
Looks like it's on us
to save the day.

596
00:37:53,296 --> 00:37:56,464
Luckily, I've got a plan.

597
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,741
Eska, Desna, listen to me.

598
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:08,660
You've got to help us
stop Unalaq.

599
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:09,861
I know he's your father,

600
00:38:09,863 --> 00:38:11,747
but Vaatu has made him
completely crazy.

601
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:14,583
We will never turn
on our father.

602
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:17,652
Please, if you let me out now,

603
00:38:17,654 --> 00:38:20,455
I can still stop him
from destroying everything.

604
00:38:20,457 --> 00:38:23,041
Once he fuses with Vaatu,

605
00:38:23,043 --> 00:38:25,260
no one will be safe.

606
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:28,797
Desna, he won't be
your father anymore.

607
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,852
You don't know
what you're talking about.

608
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:36,772
Our father is the wisest man
in the world.

609
00:38:36,774 --> 00:38:39,340
If he says what he is doing
is right,

610
00:38:39,342 --> 00:38:42,010
I believe him.

611
00:38:53,906 --> 00:38:57,242
Huh?

612
00:38:57,244 --> 00:38:58,827
You know, if I wanted
some ball of evil

613
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:00,361
lurking over my shoulder
all the time,

614
00:39:00,363 --> 00:39:03,882
I'd have stayed home
with my mother-in-law.

615
00:39:07,754 --> 00:39:09,254
All right, spirit army,

616
00:39:09,256 --> 00:39:11,723
your general is here.

617
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:13,708
Follow me!

618
00:39:20,517 --> 00:39:23,602
It's working.

619
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:32,194
It's not working.

620
00:40:04,811 --> 00:40:07,095
Get me out of here!

621
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:39,344
Whoo-hoo!

622
00:40:39,346 --> 00:40:41,730
Aah!

623
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:46,735
All right, guys.
Rescue time.

624
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:58,663
Bumi, how did you manage to
take out this entire encampment

625
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,198
on your own?

626
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,168
I did it all
with my trusty flute and...

627
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,453
oh, never mind.
You wouldn't believe it anyway.

628
00:41:05,455 --> 00:41:07,322
Let's get moving.

629
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:22,384
You run into the portal.

630
00:41:22,386 --> 00:41:24,604
I'll try to hold off anyone
who comes after you.

631
00:41:24,606 --> 00:41:27,073
No, you're too hurt.
You need a healer.

632
00:41:27,075 --> 00:41:31,060
Asami, can you take Oogi
and my dad back to my mom?

633
00:41:31,062 --> 00:41:33,796
- Mm-hmm.
- This is my fight now.

634
00:41:33,798 --> 00:41:36,199
Korra.

635
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:37,600
I love you.

636
00:41:37,602 --> 00:41:40,569
I love you too, dad.

637
00:41:40,571 --> 00:41:43,873
Yipyip.

638
00:41:50,464 --> 00:41:52,598
Once we're inside,
you go find Jinora.

639
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,967
Mako and Bolin
will take care of Unalaq

640
00:41:54,969 --> 00:41:57,270
while I close the portal,
so Vaatu can't escape.

641
00:41:57,272 --> 00:41:59,472
Wait a second.
Worst-case scenario.

642
00:41:59,474 --> 00:42:01,590
So we're fighting Unalaq,
you close the portals,

643
00:42:01,592 --> 00:42:04,861
and let's just say
something happens to you.

644
00:42:04,863 --> 00:42:08,030
Are we gonna be trapped
in there for eternity?

645
00:42:08,032 --> 00:42:10,099
If everything goes as planned,

646
00:42:10,101 --> 00:42:13,152
we'll all walk out together
after harmonic convergence.

647
00:42:13,154 --> 00:42:14,603
If not...

648
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,112
Let's go.

649
00:42:48,572 --> 00:42:51,974
Tenzin, go find Jinora.

650
00:42:51,976 --> 00:42:53,943
Come on!

651
00:43:44,044 --> 00:43:47,213
You're running out of time,
Raava.

652
00:43:47,215 --> 00:43:49,882
I know you feel it coming.

653
00:45:17,801 --> 00:45:22,918
