When the humans came
and killed the Dragon King,

00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:31,072
the Dragon Guard, my parents,
failed in their duty.

Katolis will not go to war.

We don't have to strike back.
We can choose peace.

Why have you summoned me?
Have you had a change of heart?

No, but there's something

that might change your heart.

My dad is gone. Your dad is badly hurt.

There is a hope.

59

This war started because Xadia thought
we destroyed the egg of the Dragon Prince.

But we didn't.

When the Dragon Queen sees her baby,
her heart will change.

There could be peace again.
We just have to believe in it.

So, what do you think?

The human prisoner communicates

Sign language, actually.

77
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,866
And she probably uses
Katolis sign language specifically.

78

You see, many of the regions
use different...

Can you translate, or not?

80
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:33,082
Oh, um, yes, of course.
I was top of my class in linguistics.

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,087
Although I don't suppose a hand language
would technically be linguistics.

Uh, no, I mean, I like it. It's... modest.

[sighs] It's hidden by an illusion.

To get in, I perform a special ritual
that lets me see through the spell.

Huh. So how do I get in, then?

- Rayla, something's wrong.

I'm so glad to see you safe.

117
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,688
What happened, Dad? Why are you down here?

118
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:28,150
While I tried to unite the five kingdoms
against Xadia,

119
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:33,114
the Council was more concerned
that I broke a few rules along the way.

120
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:37,618
But none of that matters.
The egg, did you get it?

121
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:42,456
[stammers] It's not an egg anymore.
It's hatched.

122
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,376
It hatched?

123
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,088
That dragon will become
the most powerful creature in the world,

124
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,549
and you've let it fall back
into Xadia's hands?

125
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,260
But, Dad, Soren could've died.

126
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,970
[Viren] That doesn't matter!

I do not mean to be cruel.

130
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,358
But we must be ready to sacrifice.
Even the things we love.

131
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:14,030
I would have asked you to choose the egg
over my life, if it came to it.

132
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,282
Do you understand?

133
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,789
Everything I do,
and everything I ask of you,

134
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,917
is for the future of humanity.

135
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,714
Is that why you told Soren
to kill the princes?

- Um, hello? Anyone?
- [Zym whimpers]

It's no use.

They can't see me, and they can't see you
or Zym because you came in with me.

00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,486
I don't get it.

140
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:58,658
They made me a ghost.
It's like being magically banished.

141
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,119
It's what happened to my parents
when they abandoned the Dragon Guard.

142
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,996
And now it's happened to me.

143
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,417
But you didn't run away from anything.
They just don't know what happened.

144
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:15,216
Yeah. Yeah, it has to be a mistake.
Come on.

145
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,343
There's one person who will understand.

146
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,774
I'm going to uncuff you now
so you can speak.

147
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,818
Don't do anything stupid.

148

What were your human soldiers
doing on the Xadian side of the border?

What are the humans planning?

150
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,130
[sighs] I'm losing my patience.

[interpreter] Um... oh, my.

153
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,142
Well? What did she say?

154
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,145
If my interpretation is correct,
and it is...

155
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:15,359
she suggested an unusual way in which
your body might accommodate your sword.

156
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:16,985
[clears throat]

157
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,239
I suppose you think that's funny.

158
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,909
That's a common sign for "yes."

159
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,580
We'll see if you have the same attitude
with our Queen.

160
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,336
[Rayla] Remember Runaan,
the leader of the assassins?

161
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,382
Uh, I think so.
Tall, pointy, aimed a bow at me?

162
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,967
Mmm-hmm. He seemed nice.

163
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,303
When my parents joined the Dragon Guard,

164
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,139
I went to live with Runaan
and his husband, Ethari.

165
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:49,477
They were my parents' best friends,
and they took care of me for years.

166
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,481
- We're going to meet Ethari.
- Will he be able to see you?

167
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,735
He wouldn't have done the spell.
He always had faith in me.

168
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,029
[exhales]

169
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,075
Ethari! It's me. I'm so glad you're here.

170
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,120
There's been a mistake.
They made me a ghost.

171
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,789
But you have to tell them,
I didn't run away.

172
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,625
Ethari?

173
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:17,837
[gasps]

174
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,808
Your Radiance.

175
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,483
We captured this human general
at our border.

176
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,611
But she refuses to cooperate
with my interrogation.

177
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,546
Dispose of her.

178
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,805
No! Ethari, not you, too.

179
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,016
[Zym whimpers]

180
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,563
This isn't fair. There has to be a way
to get his attention.

181
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,607
Hey! Ethari, was it?

182
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,569
You didn't even give Rayla a chance
to explain herself.

183
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,487
Callum, it's no use.

184
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:27,157
Listen to me! Rayla doesn't deserve this.

185
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,078
I think it worked.

186
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,292
The reflection! He can see me.

187
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,252
Yeah. I'm here.

188
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,838
Surprised to see my face?

189
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,549
- Can he hear you?
- No.

190
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,260
But he can see how I feel.

191
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,804
[Ethari] Rayla.

192
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,725
Before you left, I told Runaan
that you were too goodhearted

193
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:53,976
for the work of an assassin.

194
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,271
So I know you did not betray them
out of malice.

195
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,149
But that doesn't matter.

196
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:02,776
They're gone.

197
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,697
He's gone. Because you abandoned them.

198
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,334
[Claudia] Answer me, Dad.

199
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,962
Why did you tell Soren
to kill the princes?

200
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:26,133
Careful. If you tell the truth,
you will lose her.

201
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,720
You will need her soon.

202
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,351
[laughs]

203
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,604
Oh, is that what you thought, Soren?

204
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,442
Claudia, did you really think
I would ask him to do such a thing?

205
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,903
Surely you know your brother is...

206
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,906
um, easily confused.

207
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,409
Wait, I know I'm not the smartest,

208
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,036
but I know what you said.

209
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,498
Oh, really? What do you remember?

210
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,293
You told me to return with the news
that the princes died.

211
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,921
You said, "Accidents happen all the time."

212
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,174
Soren, I was preparing you for the worst.

213
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,510
I knew tragedy might have
already befallen them...

214
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:14,723
No! You said that I'd know to do
the right thing.

215
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,767
Soren.

216
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:22,606
I said "do the right thing,"
and somehow you heard "kill the princes."

217
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:27,069
Oh... this is disappointing, son.

218
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,153
Even for you.

219
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,198
Claudia, you believe me, right?

220
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,160
Oh, Sor-bear.

221
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:39,999
I believe you thought you heard it,
but you obviously made a mistake.

222
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:46,630
We're just really lucky you messed up
the mission you thought you had, huh?

223
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,756
[chuckles] Wow.

224
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:19,121
High Mage, I've brought someone
who wishes to speak with you.

225
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,220
I understand now. They didn't make it.

226
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,682
None of them. Only me.

227
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,266
How do you know that?

228
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,102
This.

229
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,444
<i>When assassins are sent
on a dangerous mission,</i>

230
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,447
<i>Ethari enchants one of these flowers
for each of them.</i>

231
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:58,952
<i>As long as the assassin lives
and breathes, their flower floats.</i>

232
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,707
My heart goes out with this one.

233
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:09,088
Don't worry.
I promise I will return your heart to you.

234
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,786
[Callum] So when all the others sank,
and yours didn't...

235
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:44,498
[Rayla] They thought I ran away.
Just like my parents.

236
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,543
But you didn't run.
They have it all wrong.

237
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,587
- Does it matter?

[Rayla gasps]

240
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,815
If she's not useful, get rid of her.

241
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,608
She's worthless.

242
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,110
She's not worthless.

243
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:16,655
This may be a human,
but she fought bravely,

244
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:20,868
and she treated me, her enemy,
with warrior's honor.

245
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,036
Should we not do the same?

246
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,082
Oh, my sweet little sister.

247
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,003
If you truly believe
this one is so special,

248
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,797
we'll let the Light decide her fate.

[gasps]

250
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,230
No, you have to look.

You have to look.

252
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,530
If you want to live,
you have to look into the light!

[panting]

Hmm. A human with a pure heart.
How original.

255
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,691
[scoffs] Just take her.

256
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,986
[Janai] Thank you, sister.

257
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,322
[Sunfire Queen] Enjoy your pet.

00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,290
Take my hand.

[exhales] There you are.

260
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,598
You know, I was never as strong
as the others.

261
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,976
This will only break the spell
for a moment,

262
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,980
but I couldn't bear to let you leave
without seeing you one last time.

263
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,191
But I don't understand, Rayla.
How could you abandon them?

264
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,151
I failed them.

265
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,738
It was my fault we were discovered,
but I didn't run away.

Trees to meet you.

- Trees to meet you, too.
- Don't humor him.

- [Zym chirps]
- We found the Dragon Prince.

The egg wasn't destroyed.

273
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:47,097
And I knew that if we could get him home
to his mother, there could be peace.

274
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,975
It's a miracle. I can't believe it.

275
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:54,771
But, Rayla, you need to know.
The Dragon Queen is dying.

276
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,109
Since the death of her mate,
she's fallen very ill.

277
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,570
We have to get to her. It's the only way.

I don't know.

It's a real moon opal.

I told him,
