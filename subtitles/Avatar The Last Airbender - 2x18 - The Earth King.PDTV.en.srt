Long ago,the four nations lived together in harmony

6
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:17,741
then everything changed when the firenation attacked

7
00:00:19,037 --> 00:00:22,687
Only the avatar mastered all four elements could stop them

8
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:25,767
but when the world needed him most he vanished

9
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:29,823
100 years passed, my brother and I discovered the new avatar

10
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,836
airbinder named Aang

11
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,336
And although his airbinding skill is great,

12
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:37,122
he has a lot to learn before he is ready to save anyone.

13
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:40,839
but I believe...
... Aang can save the world

You know fans just make flames stronger?

17
00:00:56,088 --> 00:00:58,674
I'm Long Feng, head of Dae-Lee.

18
00:00:58,716 --> 00:01:00,426
Why won't you let us talk to the King?

19
00:01:00,468 --> 00:01:04,055
The Earth King has no time to get involved with political squabbles.

20
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:05,931
So the King is just a figurehead.

21
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:07,850
He's your puppet!

22
00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:14,356
It's time for you to look inward, and begin asking yourself the big questions.

23
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:18,360
Who are you? And what do you want?

24
00:01:18,736 --> 00:01:20,529
I can handle you by myself.

25
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:25,242
I missed you,  buddy.

26

Book two: Earth
Chapter eighteen: The Earth King

27
00:01:36,754 --> 00:01:39,131
I missed you more than you'll ever know, buddy.

28
00:01:44,595 --> 00:01:47,420
Look, we escaped from the Dai Li, we got Appa back,

29
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,560
I'm telling you, we should go to the Earth King now and tell him our plan.

30
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:51,852
We're on a roll.

31
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:55,147
One good hour after weeks of trouble isn't much of a roll.

32
00:01:55,147 --> 00:01:56,440
We can build on it.

33
00:01:56,441 --> 00:01:58,941
If we want to invade the Fire Nation when the eclipse happens,

34
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,720
we need the Earth King's support.

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,900
What makes you think we'll get it?

36
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't know if you've noticed,

37
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,550
but things don't usually go that smoothly for our little gang.

38
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,368
I know, but I've got a good feeling about this. This time will be different.

39
00:02:11,372 --> 00:02:16,669
Sokka, Long Feng is control of the city. His conspiracy with the Dai Li is too powerful. 

40
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:20,047
I think we should just keep flying and leave this horrible place behind us.

41
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:26,345
I'm with sweetness. I've seen enough of Ba Sing Se, and I can't even see!

42
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:28,450
But now that we have Appa back,

43
00:02:28,455 --> 00:02:30,976
there is nothing stopping us from telling the Earth king the truth

44
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:32,935
about the conspiracy and the war.

45
00:02:32,977 --> 00:02:34,812
See, Aang's with me.

46
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:38,023
It's the whole reason we came here in the first place,

47
00:02:38,065 --> 00:02:39,150
we have to try.

48
00:02:40,443 --> 00:02:44,989
Well, I guess if the Earth King knew the truth, things could change.

49
00:02:45,906 --> 00:02:48,284
I don't trust the new positive Sokka.

50
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:50,828
Long Feng brainwashed you, didn't he!

51
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,794
That's probably the Dai Li searching for us. So?

52
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:01,547
Let's fly!

53
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:10,056
Can we please buy a new saddle? Riding bareback is terrifying!

54
00:03:13,184 --> 00:03:17,813
There it is. That whole thing is the palace. The Earth King's chambers should be in the center.

55
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:21,817
We have to be careful. Long Feng's probably warned the King that we're coming.

56
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:25,738
Why would you assume that? If you ask me, I think we're just gonna sail right in....Ahhh!

57
00:03:27,323 --> 00:03:28,407
What was that?!

58
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:30,951
Surface to air rocks! More incoming!

59
00:04:25,172 --> 00:04:26,841
Sorry!

60
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,561
Sorry! We just need to get through to see the Earth King.

61
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:34,492
Seriously, we're actually on your guys' side.

62
00:05:36,827 --> 00:05:38,079
Sorry.

63
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:45,795
In there.

64
00:05:54,553 --> 00:05:56,347
Toph, which way to the Earth King?

65
00:05:56,347 --> 00:05:59,683
How should I know? I'm still voting that we leave Ba Sing Se.

66
00:06:09,693 --> 00:06:12,613
- Burglar!
-Sorry, wrong door.

67
00:06:18,703 --> 00:06:23,541
You did the right thing, letting the Avatar's bison go free.

68
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,419
I don't feel right.

69
00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:45,604
Now that's an impressive door. It's gotta go somewhere.

70
00:06:57,158 --> 00:06:59,160
A little warning next time!

71
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:09,503
We need to talk to you!

72
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,089
They're here to overthrow you.

73
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,967
No, we're on your side. We're here to help.

74
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:16,343
You have to trust us.

75
00:07:16,385 --> 00:07:21,348
You invade my palace, lay waste to all my guards, break down my fancy door,

76
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,018
and you expect me to trust you?

77
00:07:24,185 --> 00:07:25,019
He has a good point.

78
00:07:25,853 --> 00:07:29,899
If you're own my side, then drop your weapons and stand down.

79
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:40,201
See, we're friends, your Earthiness.

80
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:55,758
Detain the assailants.

81
00:07:57,468 --> 00:08:00,388
But we dropped our weapons. We're your allies.

82
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,017
Make sure the Avatar and his friends never see daylight again.

83
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:06,018
The Avatar?

84
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:08,229
You're the Avatar?

85
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,064
No, him.

86
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:11,732
Over here.

87
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:15,861
What does it matter Your Highness? They're enemies of the state.

88
00:08:15,903 --> 00:08:17,822
Perhaps you're right.

89
00:08:22,243 --> 00:08:26,288
Though Bosco seems to like him. I'll hear what he has to say.

90
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:33,754
Well, sir, there is a war going on right now. For the past 100 years, in fact.

91
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:39,635
The Dai Li's kept it secret from you. It's a conspiracy to control the city, and to control you.

92
00:08:39,677 --> 00:08:42,388
A secret war? That's crazy!

93
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,056
Completely!

94
00:08:44,098 --> 00:08:49,098
Long Feng didn't want us to tell you, so he stole our Sky Bison to blackmail us.

95
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:52,482
And blackmail is the least of his crimes, he brain washed our friend!

96
00:08:52,606 --> 00:08:56,402
All lies. I've never even seen a Sky Bison Your Majesty.

97
00:08:56,444 --> 00:08:58,738
Frankly, I thought they were extinct.

98
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:02,700
Your claim is difficult to believe, even from an Avatar.

99
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,200
These hooligans are part of an anarchist cell ...

100
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:08,874
that my agents have been tracking for weeks.

101
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:13,502
If you listen to them, you're playing right into your own destruction.

102
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:18,883
I have to trust my advisor.

103
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:24,221
Wait, I can prove he's lying.

104
00:09:24,638 --> 00:09:29,060
Long Feng said he's never seen a Sky Bison, ask him to lift his robe.

105
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,896
What? I am not disrobing!

106
00:09:38,235 --> 00:09:40,196
Right there! Appa bit him.

107
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,740
Never met a Sky Bison , huh?

108
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:48,412
That happens to be a large birthmark. Thanks for showing everyone.

109
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:52,083
Well, I suppose there's no way to prove where those marks came from.

110
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,084
Of course there is!

111
00:09:58,714 --> 00:10:01,884
Yup, that pretty much proves it.

112
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:03,469
Yeah!

113
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:08,057
But it doesn't prove this crazy conspiracy theory.

114
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:12,269
Though, I suppose this matter is worth looking into.

115
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,814
- Ok  -We'll take it.
-  Yeah.  -All right.

116
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:26,701
You're burning up.

117
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:31,747
You have an intense fever.This will help cool you down.

118
00:10:31,872 --> 00:10:33,124
So thirsty.

119
00:10:36,794 --> 00:10:38,921
Here's some clean water to drink.

120
00:10:38,963 --> 00:10:42,216
Stay under the blankets, and sweat this out.

121
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:04,947
So, this is what a train is like...

122
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:08,743
I didn't realize it would be this...public.

123
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:12,288
So you've never been outside the upper ring before?

124
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:14,081
I've never been outside of the palace.

125
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:16,709
Now that's the way to travel.

126
00:11:19,003 --> 00:11:22,089
So, may I ask where we're going?

127
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:24,925
Underneath Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness.

128
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:26,761
To the Dai Li's secret headquarters.

129
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:31,932
You're about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place.

130
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,486
It's gone!

131
00:11:43,527 --> 00:11:45,613
Oh, don't tell me...

132
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:48,824
That's ok, still got my positive attitude.

133
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:52,036
The Dai Li must have known we were coming and destroyed the evidence.

134
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:55,706
Hmm. That seems awfully convenient.

135
00:11:56,082 --> 00:12:00,461
Hey, if anything, this proves the conspiracy exists even more.

136
00:12:00,628 --> 00:12:03,589
Long Feng was right, this was a waste of time.

137
00:12:03,631 --> 00:12:07,051
If you'll excuse me, I'm going back to the palace.

138
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:12,098
The wall! They'll never be able to cover that up in time!

139
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:19,480
If you come with us to the outer wall, we can prove to you that the secret war is real!

140
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:22,441
No Earth King has ever been to the outer wall.

141
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:26,237
I don't have anymore time for this nonsense.

142
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,825
If you come with us, this time you can ride on Appa.

143
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:37,123
First time flying?

144
00:12:37,164 --> 00:12:40,209
Its both thrilling and terrifying.

145
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:42,420
Yeah, I hate it too.

146
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,463
I have to be honest with you.

147
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:50,261
Part of me really hopes that what you are telling me about this war...isn't true.

148
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:51,846
I wish it wasn't.

149
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,871
It's getting late. Are you planning to retire soon, my Lord?

150
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:18,414
I'm not tired.

151
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:21,500
Relax, Fire Lord Zuko.

152
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,547
Just let go, give into it. Shut your eyes for awhile.

153
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:31,802
No, Fire Lord Zuko! Do not listen to the Blue Dragon.

154
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:37,224
You should get out of here right now. Go! Before it's too late!

155
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:42,021
Sleep now, Fire Lord Zuko.

156
00:13:53,908 --> 00:13:57,370
Sleep, just Like MOTHER!!

157
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,583
Zuko, help me!

158
00:14:09,507 --> 00:14:10,966
It's still there!

159
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,136
What is that?

160
00:14:14,178 --> 00:14:20,267
It's a drill. A giant drill made by the Fire Nation, to break through your walls.

161
00:14:24,188 --> 00:14:26,607
I can't believe I never knew.

162
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:34,824
I can explain this, Your Majesty. This is nothing more than...a construction project.

163
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:41,914
Really? Then perhaps you can explain why there's a Fire Nation insignia on your construction project.

164
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:48,254
Well, it's imported of course. You know you can't trust domestic machinery.

165
00:14:51,215 --> 00:14:54,844
Surely you don't believe these children, instead of your most loyal attendant?!

166
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:04,311
Dai Li, arrest Long Feng.

167
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:07,773
I want him to stand trial for crimes against the Earth Kingdom.

168
00:15:17,908 --> 00:15:21,996
You can't arrest me. You all need me more than you know!

169
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:25,499
Looks like Long Feng is "long gone"!

170
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:29,628
Ha...Oh, yeah, I've been waitin' to use that one.

171
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:38,703
I want to thank you, young heroes for opening my eyes.

172
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:43,583
All this time, what I thought was a great metropolis, was merely a city of fools,

173
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:47,504
and that makes me the king fool.

174
00:15:47,504 --> 00:15:51,591
We're at war, with the Fire Nation.

175
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:53,802
That's why we came to Ba Sing Se, Your Highness.

176
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:56,388
Because we think you can help us end the war.

177
00:15:56,638 --> 00:15:59,933
We don't have much time. There's a comet coming this summer.

178
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:03,603
Its energy will give the fire benders unbelievable strength.

179
00:16:03,603 --> 00:16:04,854
They'll be unstoppable.

180
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:09,609
But there is hope. Before the comet comes, we have a window of opportunity.

181
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:11,861
A solar eclipse is coming.

182
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:16,658
The sun will be entirely blocked out by the moon, and the fire benders will be helpless.

183
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,201
What are you suggesting, Sokka?

184
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,870
That's the day we need to invade the Fire Nation.

185
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:24,207
The Day of Black Sun.

186
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:29,504
I don't know. That would require moving troops out of Ba Sing Se.

187
00:16:29,504 --> 00:16:31,298
We'd be completely vulnerable.

188
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:37,262
You're already vulnerable. The Fire Nation won't stop until Ba Sing Se falls.

189
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:44,394
You can either sit back and wait for that to happen, or take the offensive, and give yourself a fighting chance.

190
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:51,192
Very well. You have my support.

191
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,955
-Alright!
-Yeah. -Good work team!

192
00:16:54,738 --> 00:16:56,656
Your Majesty.

193
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:01,453
I apologize for the interruption.

194
00:17:01,494 --> 00:17:07,250
This is General How, He's the leader of The Council of Five. My highest- ranking generals.

195
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:13,923
We searched Long Feng's office. I think we found something that will interest everybody.

196
00:17:14,591 --> 00:17:19,095
There are secret files on everyone in Ba Sing Se.

197
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:20,680
Including you kids.

198
00:17:20,722 --> 00:17:22,349
Secret files?

199
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,351
Toph Bei Fong.

200
00:17:26,853 --> 00:17:32,609
It's a letter from your mom. You mom's here in the city, and she wants to see you.

201
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:37,489
Long Feng intercepted our letters from home? That's just sad.

202
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:43,036
Aang, This scroll was attached to the horn of your bison when the Dai Li captured it.

203
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,039
It's from the Eastern Air Temple.

204
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:50,210
Is there a letter for me and Sokka by any chance?

205
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:54,214
I'm afraid not.

206
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:59,048
But there is an intelligence report that might interest you.

207
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,000
A small fleet of water tribe ships?

208
00:18:02,138 --> 00:18:04,265
What? That could be Dad.

209
00:18:04,307 --> 00:18:09,271
Protecting the mouth of Chameleon Bay, led by Hakoda. It is Dad!

210
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:15,100
You should know this is not a natural sickness.

211
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,240
But that shouldn't stop you from enjoying tea.

212
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:21,116
What, what's happening?

213
00:18:21,157 --> 00:18:23,326
You're critical decision,

214
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:29,374
what you did beneath that lake...it was in such conflict with your image of yourself,

215
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:35,130
that you are now at war within your own mind and body.

216
00:18:35,171 --> 00:18:37,674
What's that mean?

217
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,513
You're going through a metamorphosis, my nephew.

218
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,956
It will not be a pleasant experience,

219
00:18:46,956 --> 00:18:54,056
but when you come out of it, you will be the beautiful Prince you were always meant to be.

220
00:18:55,275 --> 00:19:00,280
I can't believe it. There's a man living at the Eastern Air Temple. He says he's a Guru.

221
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:03,366
What's a Guru? Some kind of poisonous blowfish?

222
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,577
No, a spiritual expert.

223
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:08,538
He wants to help me take the next step in the Avatar journey.

224
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,374
He says he can teach me to control the Avatar State.

225
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,419
And I can't believe we know where our Dad is now.

226
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:15,500
I know what you mean.

227
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,880
My Mom's in the city, and from her letter it sounds like she finally understands me.

228
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:24,471
This is all such big news. Where do we even start?

229
00:19:24,512 --> 00:19:28,266
I hate to say it, but...we have to split up.

230
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:32,400
Split up? We just found Appa and got the family back together.

231
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Now you want us to separate?

232
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:40,612
You have to meet this Guru, Aang. If we're gonna invade the Fire Nation, you need to be ready.

233
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,400
Well, if I'm going to the Eastern Air Temple.

234
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,500
Appa and I can drop you at Chameleon Bay to see your Dad.

235
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:51,331
Someone has to stay here with the Earth King and help him plan for the invasion.

236
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:52,624
I guess that's me

237
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:58,964
No Sokka, I know how badly you want to help Dad. You go to Chameleon Bay, I'll stay here with the king.

238
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,007
You..

239
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:04,886
are...the nicest... sister...ever.

240
00:20:06,262 --> 00:20:08,682
Easy there, big brother.

241
00:20:08,723 --> 00:20:11,226
Though you're right, I am.

242
00:20:16,856 --> 00:20:20,360
Katara, I need to tell you something.

243
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,946
I've been wanting to say it for a long time.

244
00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:23,989
What is it Aang?

245
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,408
Katara, I...

246
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:31,496
Alright! Who's ready to get going on our little men-only man trip?

247
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,542
Aang and Sokka, I wish you good journey.

248
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:40,255
Ba Sing Se owes you its thanks, and we look forward to your return.

249
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:47,095
Your Majesty. There are three female warriors here to see you, they're from the island of Kyoshi.

250
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:49,681
That's Suki!

251
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,601
You know these warriors?

252
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:59,065
Oh yeah. The Kyoshi warriors are a skilled group of fighters, trust worthy too. They're good friends of ours.

253
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:04,279
Then we shall welcome them as honored guests.

254
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:07,824
Wait, Aang.

255
00:21:11,786 --> 00:21:15,624
- I'm really gonna miss you guys.
- Me too

256
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:25,925
Great! That's enough! Ok, we love each other.  Seriously.

257
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:05,924
You see Aang, a little positive thinking works wonders.

258
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,500
We got the King on our side, we got Long Feng arrested,

259
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,700
and when we get back, Suki's waiting for me.

260
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:17,310
Yeah, girls are waiting for us. Thanks "positive attitude".

261
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:22,315
Everything's gonna work out perfectly, from now on and forever.

262
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,574
Dinner.

263
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:35,600
The Council of Five and the military are loyal to the Earth King,

264
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,620
but the Dai Li remains loyal to you, Long Feng, sir.

265
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:59,894
Hello? Mom? Anyone home?

266
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:09,446
Hey! Who do you think you're dealing with?!

267
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:14,659
One loud mouth little brat who strayed too far from home.

268
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,420
In our hour of need,

269
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,940
it is with the highest honor that I welcome our esteemed allies,

270
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,760
the Kyoshi warriors.

271
00:23:32,302 --> 00:23:36,389
We are the Earth King's humble servants.

272
00:23:37,394 --> 00:23:41,561
