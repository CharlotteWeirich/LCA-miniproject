2
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:23,639
Well, what'll it be, folks?

3
00:00:23,764 --> 00:00:25,075
Tap water or bottled?

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,342
Whatever.

5
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:27,819
Kif, you pick.

6
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:30,580
Oh, oh, it's always
so hard to decide.

7
00:00:30,705 --> 00:00:32,866
Um, uh, tap.
I mean bottled.

8
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,885
Bam!

9
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,022
Ooh, I love your boots, Leela.

10
00:00:39,147 --> 00:00:41,375
Nobody would ever guess
they're knockoffs.

11
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,543
How could you tell?
I guessed.

12
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:45,837
(Imitates cat's yowl)
They're at it again.

13
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:47,097
Please, Fry.

14
00:00:47,222 --> 00:00:49,341
Girlfriends always
talk trash to each other.

15
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,234
Like how I might say
I like Amy's dress

16
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,936
'cause it covers
all her tramp stamps.

17
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:54,596
(Yowls)

18
00:00:54,762 --> 00:00:56,005
Knock it off, Fry.

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,941
It's when women are
polite to each other

20
00:00:58,066 --> 00:00:59,518
that you know there's a problem.

21
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,211
Exactly.

22
00:01:01,336 --> 00:01:04,022
Now, enough about who is
and who isn't a Chinese skank.

23
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:07,117
We're just two happy couples
on a double date.

24
00:01:07,242 --> 00:01:09,361
(Screeching yowl)

25
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,740
(Grunts)

26
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:16,702
(Strained grunting)

27
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,927
Let's go! Let's go!

28
00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:19,462
We've got to get these moon rocks

29
00:01:19,587 --> 00:01:21,581
to the moon by moondown.

30
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:23,733
Why are we bringing moon rocks
to the moon?

31
00:01:23,858 --> 00:01:25,127
(Grunts)

32
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,937
Oh, those lunar crybabies
claim the rocks

33
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:30,424
were stolen by the Apollo astronauts.

34
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,552
They consider them part
of their cultural heritage.

35
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,879
(Strained grunting)

36
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:37,713
Nice work, Leela.

37
00:01:37,838 --> 00:01:39,433
You're really pulling your weight.

38
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,809
Which is saying something.

39
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,644
(Yowls)

40
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,396
Ow!

41
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,447
You're using the rocks
to build a wall?

42
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,398
What about your cultural heritage?

43
00:01:55,523 --> 00:01:57,834
You bought that cultural
heritage hoo-ha?

44
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,169
(Scoffs)

45
00:01:59,294 --> 00:02:01,413
What a bunch of big-city dummies.

46
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,839
At least the rocks are light here.

47
00:02:02,964 --> 00:02:04,107
I don't even need my

48
00:02:04,232 --> 00:02:05,834
over-the-shoulder Boulder holder.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,443
With one-sixth gravity, you can work

50
00:02:07,568 --> 00:02:09,012
and be lazy at the same time.

51
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:11,006
It's like being a voice actor.

52
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,516
Say, you nose-breathers
want to come see

53
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:15,351
some real moon culture,

54
00:02:15,476 --> 00:02:18,096
come on down to the
butterfly derby tonight.

55
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:20,023
Wait, the butterfly derby is when?

56
00:02:20,148 --> 00:02:21,641
And what?

57
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,337
The low gravity lets them nice ladies

58
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:35,781
flap every which way,

59
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:39,868
so long as they only wear light,
skimpy outfits.

60
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,329
It's a necessity of the sport, it is.

61
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,813
This is actually quite elegant.

62
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:45,381
It's not what I was expecting.

63
00:02:45,506 --> 00:02:46,883
(Drumroll)

64
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:48,418
Announcer (Over P.A.):
Ladies and gentlemen,

65
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:50,019
please welcome the meanest things

66
00:02:50,144 --> 00:02:51,296
on gossamer wings...

67
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,010
The Murderflies!

68
00:02:53,135 --> 00:02:53,965
(Buzzer sounds)

69
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:57,719
(Grunting and groaning)

70
00:02:57,885 --> 00:02:59,528
This is what I was expecting.

71
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:02,031
So, uh, what are the rules
of this sport?

72
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:03,809
You see that there?

73
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,301
That's called a floor.

74
00:03:05,426 --> 00:03:08,230
Once a butterfly hits that,
she's out.

75
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,039
Last team flying wins.

76
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:12,859
Announcer:
Super swatter!

77
00:03:18,322 --> 00:03:20,075
(Cheering)

78
00:03:23,277 --> 00:03:24,663
(Pained yelp)

79
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,758
Keep your eye on the ground.

80
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:30,894
That's where she's going to land.

81
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,395
(Pained grunt)

82
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,797
Yep, called it.

83
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,398
(Cheering and applause)

84
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:38,760
And now, for our weekly
amateur flapdown.

85
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:40,169
Do we have two volunteers

86
00:03:40,294 --> 00:03:42,071
to go wing-to-wing
with the Murderflies?

87
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:43,907
Winners get 50 bucks
and the accolades

88
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:45,767
of dozens of hooting hillbillies.

89
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:48,603
(Hooting)

90
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:49,879
What do you think, Leela?

91
00:03:50,004 --> 00:03:51,347
Judging from your tank top,

92
00:03:51,472 --> 00:03:53,692
you love getting hooted at
by hillbillies.

93
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,584
And you could use the $50

94
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,686
for another gallon
of hello kitty perfume.

95
00:03:57,811 --> 00:03:59,422
The bicker sisters teaming up?

96
00:03:59,547 --> 00:04:02,225
(Scoffs) Talk about
cat women on the moon.

97
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,035
(Both yowl)

98
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:05,861
Okay, enough of that already.

99
00:04:05,986 --> 00:04:07,956
We're not really fighting.

100
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,125
Then prove it... by fighting.

101
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,767
All right, we will.

102
00:04:11,892 --> 00:04:13,086
Come on, Amy.

103
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,171
(Both grunt)

104
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,238
Why don't you and I

105
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:17,299
ever do things together?

106
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:21,801
(Both grunting)

107
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,265
This is hard.

108
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:27,851
Now I know why butterflies
are always so grouchy.

109
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,386
Announcer: Please welcome
tonight's volunteer victims:

110
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:33,440
Turanga Leela and Amy Wong!

111
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,525
Hang on.
We're not quite ready to...

112
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,319
(Pained yelling)

113
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,987
(Screams)

114
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:42,490
You girls have moxie.

115
00:04:42,656 --> 00:04:44,159
We're going to beat it out of you.

116
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,745
Amy, remember when we tried
out for the rockettes?

117
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,471
And we failed because we accidentally

118
00:04:48,596 --> 00:04:50,081
kicked those two rockettes to death?

119
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:52,083
Yeah. Why do you bring that up?

120
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:53,919
(Gasps) Oh.

121
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:01,593
(Crowd gasping)

122
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:05,013
We'll teach you
not to lose immediately.

123
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,309
Announcer:
Super shocker!

124
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,020
(Cheering)

125
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,162
(Squawks)

126
00:05:13,287 --> 00:05:14,430
(Electrical crackling)

127
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:16,775
(Crowd gasps and murmurs)

128
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,195
(Electrical crackling,
pained yelling)

129
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:23,990
(Grunting)

130
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:26,201
(Yelling)

131
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,036
(Electrical crackling)

132
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,329
(Crowd gasping)

133
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:33,541
(Gasping)

134
00:05:33,707 --> 00:05:35,184
(Groaning weakly)

135
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:38,004
(Cheering and applause)

136
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,556
Yay. They can move their arms.

137
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:44,684
Congratulations to our gutsy,
non-paralyzed challengers.

138
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,996
(Chuckling)

139
00:05:47,121 --> 00:05:48,297
Ladies, that is the kind

140
00:05:48,422 --> 00:05:49,999
of can-do performance
I like to see...

141
00:05:50,124 --> 00:05:52,394
From my new butterfly derby team.

142
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,370
Which is what
I am offering you to be.

143
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:56,906
Because I'm the commissioner
of the butterfly derby.

144
00:05:57,031 --> 00:05:58,207
I'm Abner Doubledeal.

145
00:05:58,332 --> 00:05:59,567
Hello.

146
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:00,843
But we lost.

147
00:06:00,968 --> 00:06:02,696
Why would you want us
to join your league?

148
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,913
We're always looking for fresh blood,

149
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:05,381
and you girls are full of it.

150
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:07,200
You two could be the next big thing.

151
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,910
What happened to the last big thing?

152
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:10,520
Nothing that doesn't happen
to everyone eventually.

153
00:06:10,645 --> 00:06:12,580
What is this, an inquisition?
You in or not?

154
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:13,989
Yes.

155
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:15,625
You spletcha.

156
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,227
Bender:
<i>And so began the fight career</i>

157
00:06:18,352 --> 00:06:19,629
<i>of two skimpy outfits</i>

158
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:21,840
<i>and the feisty women who filled them.</i>

159
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,233
Doubledeal:
Ladies and gentlemen, the Wingnuts!

160
00:06:24,358 --> 00:06:25,969
(Cheering and applause)

161
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:27,804
Bender: <i>And although sometimes
they got beaten,</i>

162
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,339
<i>other times, they got beaten badly.</i>

163
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:31,933
(Thudding)

164
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,409
<i>But just when it looked</i>

165
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:34,894
<i>like they'd never win...</i>

166
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:36,938
<i>They didn't.</i>

167
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:39,182
Well, we lost to all our opponents.

168
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:41,951
Even that team that turned out
to be us in the mirror.

169
00:06:42,076 --> 00:06:43,528
It's time we gave up.

170
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,455
Yeah. I don't know what else

171
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,739
we could have done
to enhance our performance.

172
00:06:47,864 --> 00:06:49,966
Hey, great job tonight, you two.

173
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:51,953
Here, got you some fresh nectar.

174
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:56,932
(Deep voice): Whoa, that puts
the lead in my pencil.

175
00:06:57,057 --> 00:06:59,359
Thanks, trainer.

176
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,050
Excuse me. What's that nectar
you're handing out?

177
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,375
It's a plant-based supplement

178
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,111
that bulks up your flapping muscles.

179
00:07:08,236 --> 00:07:09,545
Want to try it?

180
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,889
You know you want to.

181
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,615
A chemical that can help us win?

182
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,392
That sounds great.

183
00:07:14,558 --> 00:07:17,120
Mmm... I'm not sure.

184
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:19,731
Look, here's my disposable
cell phone number.

185
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,324
Think it over.
Give me a call when you're...

186
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:23,159
(Cell phone ringing)
Hang on. I got to take this.

187
00:07:23,284 --> 00:07:24,160
Hello?

188
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:25,487
We're ready.
Great.

189
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,563
You are not going to regret this.

190
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:30,633
It's a nice, clean way
to improve your performance.

191
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:31,826
And we just drink it?

192
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:33,136
Or... (Splutters)

193
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:34,470
Inject it between your toes.

194
00:07:34,595 --> 00:07:36,829
Either way works, right?

195
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:39,609
Well... down the hatch.

196
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:40,843
(Gulping)

197
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:42,111
Ah.
Ah.

198
00:07:42,236 --> 00:07:43,613
(Glass breaks)
Mmm.

199
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:45,840
(Deep voice): A guy
could get used to this.

200
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:49,731
{pub}Once again,

201
00:07:49,856 --> 00:07:53,473
Eternulax The Immortal,
dead at the age of 26.

202
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,890
(Chuckling)

203
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:57,526
Now here's Sportsbot 5000 to tell us

204
00:07:57,651 --> 00:08:00,562
about two local gals,
Amy Wong and Turanga Leela,

205
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:03,598
who have won 15
butterfly derby bouts in a row,

206
00:08:03,723 --> 00:08:06,068
even as rumors swirl
that they're juicing up

207
00:08:06,193 --> 00:08:08,037
with the controversial
nutritional supplement

208
00:08:08,162 --> 00:08:09,371
known as nectar.

209
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:10,782
Sportsbot?

210
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,826
(Monotone):
That's pretty much it.

211
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,709
Linda:
Riveting stuff, Sportsbot.

212
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:17,414
Yo, yo, yo.
What's up, ladies?

213
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:21,000
(Gulping)

214
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,951
Uh-oh.
The bullies are back.

215
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:26,455
Leela, Amy, I like a
stalwart, feminine physique

216
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,343
as much as the next fellow,
but this nectar worries me.

217
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,261
You should be worried about this!

218
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,471
Boo-ya!
(Whimpers)

219
00:08:33,637 --> 00:08:35,130
Easy, Amy, easy.

220
00:08:35,255 --> 00:08:37,032
Professor, there's nothing
wrong with nectar.

221
00:08:37,157 --> 00:08:38,476
It's all-natural.

222
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:40,569
So are carrots, but you don't see me

223
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:43,429
injecting them between my toes.

224
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,202
(Grunting)

225
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:52,948
(Clears throat)
Uh, Leela?

226
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:55,785
I was wondering if you'd like
to go out with me again.

227
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:58,663
Maybe play some miniature golf
or colossal tennis?

228
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,289
Sorry, Fry.

229
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,418
I already got a double
date with arm and hammer.

230
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,993
(Groans)

231
00:09:05,118 --> 00:09:06,895
Bender, you want to go
out and do something?

232
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,265
Oh, so now I'm your
last-resort Booty call, huh?

233
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,885
Okay, let's go.

234
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,597
(Cheering and applause)

235
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,891
(Choking)

236
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:23,354
(Grunting)

237
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,486
(Groans)

238
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,738
That's my little sugar doodle.

239
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:34,032
Cork your face bladder.
I'm working!

240
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,290
Sorry.

241
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:36,525
I had that coming.

242
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,286
It's not easy being a derby wife.

243
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,372
The Wingnuts, ladies and gentlemen.

244
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:43,832
And that bloodbath takes them
to next week's finals

245
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:45,919
against our reigning champions,
the Murderflies.

246
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,327
(Cheering and applause)

247
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,132
Now, listen up.

248
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:53,718
I got a little boy
at home, and he's dying.

249
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,471
Dying to see me kill these two.

250
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,264
(Hooting and cheering)

251
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,141
Oh, your son's going
to die all right...

252
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:01,726
But from neglect.

253
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:04,486
'Cause you're going home in an urn.

254
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:06,731
A funerary urn.

255
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,108
(Cheering)

256
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,994
Hey, trainer, we got
a big bout next week.

257
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,463
Juice us up.

258
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:16,449
Sorry, gals. I'm all out.

259
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,800
These two just bought
my entire supply.

260
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:20,828
(Laughing)

261
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:23,038
You're going...

262
00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:24,788
(Deep voice):
Down.

263
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,979
And she doesn't even
want to cuddle anymore.

264
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:33,415
She just wants to hit me
with various chairs.

265
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,849
You're lucky.

266
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:38,053
I can't even get Leela
to verbally abuse me.

267
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:39,889
All right, listen up.

268
00:10:40,055 --> 00:10:42,324
We're out of nectar,
and we need a new source.

269
00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:43,992
Uh, dearest, perhaps this would be

270
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:47,162
a good time to consider
possibly drinking

271
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:48,930
just a little less...
(Whimpers)

272
00:10:49,055 --> 00:10:51,985
Say, why don't you just
have Kif get you some nectar?

273
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,654
It comes from a flower
on his home planet.

274
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,838
You mean it's ocephalus nectar?

275
00:10:56,963 --> 00:10:58,740
Oh, my. Oh, dear.

276
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:00,775
It's found
in a rather remote region...

277
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,077
Just play along.

278
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:03,830
This could be our chance for romance.

279
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,380
Come on, ladies.

280
00:11:05,505 --> 00:11:07,182
Let's take a little trip
to Kif's planet.

281
00:11:07,307 --> 00:11:10,185
We'll gather some nectar, and
have a nice, romantic weekend.

282
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,753
Just the four of us.

283
00:11:11,878 --> 00:11:14,757
Let's go already!

284
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:36,904
Wow! It's the second most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

285
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,158
Hey Leela, want to know what
the <i>most</i> beautiful thing is?

286
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,910
No. Let's get hopped up.

287
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:46,921
Greetings eco-tourists!

288
00:11:47,046 --> 00:11:51,127
I am the grand butterfly
curator... this week.

289
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,762
Yeah, yeah, you can teach us
to respect nature later.

290
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:56,215
Right now, we've got
some flowers to suck dry.

291
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,467
Suck 'em, burn 'em... as long as
they're not butterflies,

292
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,886
I don't give a grand crap.

293
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,503
But take heed!

294
00:12:01,628 --> 00:12:04,766
For you see, it is mating season.

295
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,577
Whatever you do, you must not
disturb the aggressive male.

296
00:12:08,702 --> 00:12:11,346
He can be identified
by his orange coloration

297
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:13,608
and enormous butterjunk.

298
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,451
(Scoffs) What's he gonna do,
migrate at us?

299
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:18,529
(Laughs)
Silence!

300
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:20,689
I can't be specific about the danger,

301
00:12:20,814 --> 00:12:22,257
since if something different happens,

302
00:12:22,382 --> 00:12:23,958
I might be liable for damages.

303
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,787
But believe me,

304
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:30,875
you'll rue the day you came
to the butterfly preserve.

305
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,919
Well, enjoy the butterfly preserve.

306
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,002
Okay, bye.

307
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:35,296
Come on, come on.

308
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:36,638
Let's find those flowers.

309
00:12:36,763 --> 00:12:37,972
We'll split into teams.

310
00:12:38,097 --> 00:12:39,675
You mean couples?

311
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,803
Eh? Eh?

312
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,845
Nice job smacking Kif.

313
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,473
Dude had it coming. Wait.

314
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,515
(Sniffs)

315
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,684
I think I smell nectar.

316
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,851
(Mouth full):
Way ahead of you!

317
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:51,688
(Gulping)

318
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:53,455
(Grunting)

319
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,390
I don't even know
why we're helping find

320
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:58,159
an addictive drug for
our mean girlfriends.

321
00:12:58,284 --> 00:13:00,029
Quiet, they'll hear you.

322
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:03,532
(Hisses)
(Screams)

323
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,966
The male butterfly.

324
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:06,167
It's gorgeous!

325
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:07,369
Let me get my butterfly hammer.

326
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:08,870
Bender, no.

327
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:11,906
That park ranger explicitly
gave us a vague warning.

328
00:13:12,031 --> 00:13:14,627
Look, the hammer's already out;
I got to smash something.

329
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,735
(Growling)

330
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:24,262
(Screams)

331
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,321
(Shrieks)

332
00:13:26,446 --> 00:13:28,380
(Spitting)

333
00:13:32,227 --> 00:13:33,862
(Groans)

334
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:37,567
It smells like a skunk
stuffed with feta cheese.

335
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,534
(Groaning)
P.U.!

336
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:41,779
Thank God I don't have a nose.

337
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,702
We can sleep at my parents' house.

338
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,579
I'll just buzz and let
them know we're here.

339
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,790
(Buzzing)

340
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:55,884
Mom, dad, I'm sure you remember

341
00:13:56,009 --> 00:14:00,339
Fry, Leela, Bender, and of
course my fon-fon-ru, Amy.

342
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:02,675
Welcome to our home.

343
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,343
One of you stinks.

344
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:05,427
That'd be me.

345
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:06,795
Wait, you're flies.

346
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,347
Don't you eat excrement?

347
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:11,058
That's a day at the beach
compared to this.

348
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:14,369
Listen, I'm just gonna shower
this stuff off and go to bed.

349
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:16,689
Wait.
Don't take a shower, Fry.

350
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,573
You smell kind of nice.

351
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:19,775
(Inhales deeply)

352
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,694
Uh, sm... yeah.
Huh?

353
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,478
No hanky-panky.

354
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:26,365
Everyone sleep in separate rooms.

355
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:28,075
Good night, Kif.

356
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:29,918
Night, Fry.
Huh?

357
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:32,921
(Both moaning)

358
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:35,156
Keep your door unlocked tonight.

359
00:14:35,281 --> 00:14:39,045
But McGruff the crime dog says... oh!

360
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,993
(Snoring, buzzing)

361
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:52,908
(Knocking)

362
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:54,967
(Singsong):
Come in.

363
00:15:00,473 --> 00:15:01,984
(Fry giggling, kissing)

364
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,739
Hey, smelly-pants.

365
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:07,823
Leela?!

366
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:08,783
Leela?!

367
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,618
Amy?!
Amy?!

368
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,527
I'm done polishing my ass, Fry.

369
00:15:12,652 --> 00:15:13,829
Here's your toothbrush back.

370
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,331
(Gasps)

371
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:18,824
(Gasps louder)

372
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,324
{pub}You just hop into bed
with my boyfriend?!

373
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:26,551
And you!

374
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,154
As God is my witness,
I'll never forgive you for this!

375
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,596
(Moaning)

376
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:33,624
Hey, just 'cause he's your boyfriend

377
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:35,493
doesn't mean you get him
all to yourself.

378
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:37,270
(Moaning)

379
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,398
He's mine! There's nothing
more to talk about.

380
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,816
No, no, keep talking.

381
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,360
Um, Amy, I hope I'm not
out of line, but...

382
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,603
Shut up, Kif.

383
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:48,906
How dare you talk
that way to my Kif?!

384
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,827
This planet's got it going on.

385
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:57,415
Sweet orgy of Georgia!

386
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,083
Have you girls gone wild?

387
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,793
That's Fry you're macking on.

388
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,321
(Sniffing)

389
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:07,325
Hmm. It seems Fry's
inexplicable sex appeal

390
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,803
is due to the butterfly
pheromone he was sprayed with.

391
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,630
But Amy and Leela aren't butterflies.

392
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:14,140
Right?

393
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,268
No, but thanks to
the damned butterfly nectar

394
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,645
they've been swilling,
they might as well be.

395
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:21,506
(Gulping, burps)

396
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:23,808
The nectar causes
their bodies to produce

397
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,843
female butterfly hormones,

398
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:27,778
building up their flapping muscles,

399
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,365
but also making them
irresistibly attracted to Fry.

400
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:32,283
(Groans)

401
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,519
The only way to end this madness

402
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:36,988
is for the ladies
to quit, cold Turkey.

403
00:16:37,113 --> 00:16:38,039
Fry:
Whoa, whoa!

404
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,690
Let's not shock their system.

405
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:42,293
Maybe they could just go warm Turkey?

406
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,128
No, the Professor's right.

407
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,563
We have to quit the nectar.

408
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:46,831
I agree.

409
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:48,633
This has to stop.

410
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,336
(Leela and Amy moaning)

411
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:53,138
(Groans)

412
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:55,640
My guts feel kind of weird.

413
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,042
I'm not surprised.

414
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:59,310
Those pheromones were
highly concentrated.

415
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:03,356
Oh, I think I'm getting
a little... caterpilly.

416
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:16,243
All right,
let's get this party ended.

417
00:17:19,162 --> 00:17:21,916
(Both groaning)

418
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,718
Leela:
We did it!

419
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:34,261
We kicked nectar's butt!

420
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:35,280
(Cheering)

421
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:36,597
I don't give a crap!

422
00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:38,383
Kif, I'm sorry for

423
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:41,018
making out with Fry
so loud and often.

424
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,687
It's all right, dearest.

425
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,889
I know it was just
the nectar talking.

426
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:46,691
And groping.

427
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,860
Well, looks like Fry's three-way
is down to a one-way.

428
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,070
If he's lucky.

429
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,280
Hey, where is Fry?

430
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,974
Amy, Leela! What are you doing
at your place of work?

431
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:05,076
Your match with the Murderflies
is about to start.

432
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:06,085
(Both gasp)

433
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:13,050
Doubledeal:
Moon-ladies and moon-men,

434
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:15,052
presenting the defending champions,

435
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,922
the queens of hostility
from the sea of tranquility,

436
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:20,891
the Murderflies!

437
00:18:21,057 --> 00:18:24,145
(Crowd cheering)

438
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,432
And now their opponents:
The vixens most horrible

439
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:30,484
from the big blue marble,
the Wingnuts.

440
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,836
(Cheering)

441
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:34,321
Everybody kill everybody!

442
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,323
Well, we're not on the juice anymore,

443
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:38,159
but what's the worst that can happen?

444
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:40,478
Since this is a championship match,

445
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:42,830
we are gonna need some lava!

446
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,784
Wait. Hot lava?

447
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:48,711
(Buzzer sounds)

448
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,656
Amy, if we get killed,
I just want to say

449
00:18:51,781 --> 00:18:53,883
it's been an honor riding the
roller coaster of addiction

450
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:56,719
and recovery with you, as a team.

451
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:57,845
(Grunts)

452
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,138
(Both scream)

453
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,858
How could this not be hurting you?

454
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,152
I once killed a sea turtle
with these boots.

455
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:14,402
(Grunts)

456
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,047
(Crowd gasps)

457
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:17,448
Hold me.

458
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,038
(Screaming)

459
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,208
(Screaming)

460
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,293
(Crowd gasps)

461
00:19:34,457 --> 00:19:36,383
(Both screaming)

462
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:44,209
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, no, no. Oh, no.

463
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:45,726
Make a wish.

464
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,152
(Crowd gasps)

465
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,588
My God!

466
00:19:56,713 --> 00:20:00,091
Fry has metamorphosed
into a gigantic butterfly!

467
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:03,035
He's even more beautiful than before!

468
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:05,996
(Gasping)

469
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:07,790
(Sniffs, sighs)

470
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,825
Ooh, what is that sexy stink?

471
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:13,170
(Tank and truck giggling)

472
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,439
Professor:
Oh, cripes!

473
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:16,006
They're mating!

474
00:20:16,172 --> 00:20:17,341
(Crowd groaning)

475
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,843
Ladies and gentlemen,

476
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,746
I am so sorry for allowing
this lurid sex act

477
00:20:21,871 --> 00:20:25,474
to taint an otherwise delightful
day of family-friendly violence.

478
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,951
(Tank and truck giggling)

479
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:30,221
That is some freaky
bug-on-bug action.

480
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:32,398
I feel a little left out.

481
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,570
(Groaning)

482
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,297
Is Fry going to be okay?

483
00:20:39,422 --> 00:20:40,898
I don't think so.

484
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:43,534
He's grown all these
strange insect parts,

485
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,079
and he has absolutely
no brain activity.

486
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:48,706
Look!

487
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,708
He lost the strange insect parts.

488
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,961
(Groaning continues)

489
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,379
He's back to normal!

490
