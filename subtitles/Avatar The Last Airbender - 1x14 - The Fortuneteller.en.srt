<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:17,575
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

10
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:31,050
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:36,989
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,612
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

Chapter Fourteen: The Fortuneteller

15
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:55,435
Look!

16
00:01:01,216 --> 00:01:07,521
He is taunting us. You are so gonna be dinner!

17
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,763
Hey! Where's the fishing line?

18
00:01:09,823 --> 00:01:13,202
Oh, I didn't think you would need it, Sokka.

19
00:01:13,262 --> 00:01:15,642
Aahh, it's all tangled!

20
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:19,660
Not tangled... woven. I made you a necklace, Katara.

21
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,240
I thought since you lost your other one...

22
00:01:25,237 --> 00:01:27,564
Thanks, Aang. I love it.

23
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:28,721
Great, Aang.

24
00:01:28,777 --> 00:01:32,383
Maybe instead of saving the world you can go into the jewelry making business.

25
00:01:32,435 --> 00:01:36,063
I don't see why I can't do both.

26
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:40,591
Stop taunting me!

27
00:01:42,784 --> 00:01:45,951
So, how do I look?

28
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:54,498
You mean all of you or just your neck? I mean, uh, both look great.

29
00:01:54,554 --> 00:01:59,113
Smoochie, smoochie, someone's in love.

30
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:01,050
I... well...

31
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:07,856
Stop teasing him, Sokka. Aang's just a good friend. A sweet little guy... just like Momo.

32
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:09,644
Thanks.

33
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:19,052
Someone's being attacked by a platypus bear!

34
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:32,470
Well, hello there. Nice day, isn't it?

35
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,074
Make noise, it'll run off!

36
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:36,481
No, play dead, he'll lose interest!

37
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:39,748
Whoa! Close one.

38
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:41,746
Run down hill, then climb a tree!

39
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,273
No, punch him in the bill!

40
00:02:43,324 --> 00:02:45,488
And then run in zigzags!

41
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,052
No need. It's going to be fine.

42
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:57,668
Whoa there!

43
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,400
Mmm! Lunch! Lucky for you we came along.

44
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:15,285
Thanks, but everything was already under control.

45
00:03:15,358 --> 00:03:19,975
Not to worry, Aunt Wu predicted I'd have a safe journey.

46
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:20,916
Aunt who?

47
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:28,401
No, Aunt Wu. She's the fortuneteller from my village. Awful nice knowing your future.

48
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:32,620
Wow, it must be. That explains why you were so calm.

49
00:03:32,703 --> 00:03:34,796
But the fortuneteller was wrong!

50
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,663
You didn't have a safe journey, you were almost killed!

51
00:03:37,703 --> 00:03:43,468
But I wasn't. All right, have a good one!

52
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:50,619
Oh, and Aunt Wu said if I met any travelers to give them this.

53
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,394
Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu and learn our fortunes. It could be fun.

54
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:59,608
Oh come on, fortunetelling is nonsense.

55
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:03,846
What do ya know, an umbrella!

56
00:04:03,873 --> 00:04:05,201
That proves it.

57
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:08,781
No it doesn't... you can't really tell the future.

58
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:13,766
I guess you're not really getting wet then.

59
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:18,476
Of course she predicted it was gonna rain. The sky's been gray all day.

60
00:04:18,554 --> 00:04:22,658
Just admit you might be wrong and you can come under the umbrella.

61
00:04:22,743 --> 00:04:28,747
Look, I'm going to predict the future now... "It's going to keep drizzling."

62
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:30,852
See!

63
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:35,813
Not everyone has the gift, Sokka.

64
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:56,628
Aunt Wu is expecting you.

65
00:04:56,694 --> 00:04:58,672
Really?

66
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:09,618
My name is Meng and I'm Aunt Wu's assistant.

67
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:14,977
Well hello there.

68
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:16,115
Hello.

69
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:20,498
Can I get you some tea, or some of Aunt Wu's special bean curd puffs?

70
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:21,848
I'll try a curd puff.

71
00:05:21,893 --> 00:05:24,464
Just a second. So what's your name?

72
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:25,647
Aang.

73
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:31,575
That rhymes with Meng! And you've got some pretty big ears, don't you?

74
00:05:31,656 --> 00:05:33,249
I... guess...

75
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,916
Oh, don't be modest. They're huge!

76
00:05:35,964 --> 00:05:40,171
Well Aang, it is very nice to meet you. Very nice.

77
00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:42,183
Likewise.

78
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,165
I can't believe we're here in the house of nonsense.

79
00:05:45,192 --> 00:05:47,478
Try to keep an open mind, Sokka.

80
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,286
There are things in this world that just can't be explained.

81
00:05:50,322 --> 00:05:53,007
Wouldn't it be nice to have some insight into your future?

82
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:57,403
It would be nice to have some bean curd puffs.

83
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:02,262
Oh Meng! Aunt Wu says I'm going to meet my true love!

84
00:06:02,307 --> 00:06:05,351
He's going to give me a rare panda lilly.

85
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:12,225
That's so romantic. I wonder if my true love will give me a rare flower.

86
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:14,203
Good luck with that!

87
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:20,290
Is that the big eared guy who Aunt Wu predicted you'd marry?

88
00:06:26,324 --> 00:06:30,105
Enjoy your snack.

89
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:37,920
Welcome young travelers. Now, who's next? Don't be shy.

90
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:42,017
I guess that's me.

91
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:46,034
Not bad. Not bad.

92
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:50,893
I'm good on puffs.

93
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:54,777
So... what do you think they're talking about back there?

94
00:06:54,837 --> 00:06:56,888
Boring stuff, I'm sure. Love.

95
00:06:56,946 --> 00:06:59,818
Who she's going to marry. How many babies she's gonna have.

96
00:06:59,888 --> 00:07:06,270
Yeh... dumb stuff like that... well, I've gotta find a bathroom!

97
00:07:09,397 --> 00:07:13,868
Your palms are so smooth... do you use moisturizer?

98
00:07:13,914 --> 00:07:19,099
Actually, I have this special seaweed lotion. I could get you some if you want.

99
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,443
So, do you see anything interesting in my love line?

100
00:07:22,477 --> 00:07:27,594
I feel great romance for you. The man you're going to marry...

101
00:07:27,635 --> 00:07:28,761
Tell me more!

102
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:35,394
I can see that he is a very powerful bender.

103
00:07:40,537 --> 00:07:43,544
Looks like someone had a pretty good bathroom break.

104
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:45,494
Yeh, when I was in there...

105
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,788
I don't even wanna know!

106
00:07:46,846 --> 00:07:48,124
Who's next?

107
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,337
Okay, let's get this over with.

108
00:07:50,381 --> 00:07:56,948
Your future is full of struggle and anguish, most of it self-inflicted.

109
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:59,267
But, you didn't read my palms or anything!

110
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:05,377
I don't need to... it's written all over your face.

111
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:09,554
You then, come with me.

112
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:16,069
This is the most reliable method of telling your fortune. The bones never lie.

113
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:19,830
Go on, pick one.

114
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,723
Now throw it on the fire.

115
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:30,041
The heat makes cracks in the bones and I read the bone cracks to tell your destiny.

116
00:08:30,097 --> 00:08:33,423
Wow, that's a big crack.

117
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:37,372
I've never seen this before.

118
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,477
Oh my!

119
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:52,004
The old destiny, this is incredible! You will be involved in a great battle,...

120
00:08:52,061 --> 00:08:55,769
...an awesome conflict between the forces of good and evil,...

121
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:00,575
...a battle whose outcome will determine the fate of the whole world!

122
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:04,430
Yeh, yeh, I knew that already, but did it say anything about a girl?

123
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,559
A girl? You want to know about love?

124
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,735
Yes!

125
00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:13,561
I'm sorry, but I didn't see anything.

126
00:09:13,606 --> 00:09:17,325
Oh look! I must have missed something.

127
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:24,106
Right here... it says, "trust your heart and you will be with the one you love."

128
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:28,163
Really!? Thank you, Aunt Wu!

129
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:33,812
Well, now you got to see for yourselves that fortunetelling is just a big, stupid hoax.

130
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:37,434
You're just saying that because you're going to make yourself unhappy your whole life.

131
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:44,329
That woman is crazy! My life will be calm, and happy and joyful!

132
00:09:45,923 --> 00:09:47,746
That doesn't prove anything!

133
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:52,663
Well, I liked my predictions. Certain things are going to turn out very well.

134
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:54,582
They sure are.

135
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:56,823
Why, what did she tell you?

136
00:09:56,871 --> 00:10:00,780
Some stuff. You'll find out.

137
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,141
What's with the sky?

138
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:08,871
We are waiting for Aunt Wu to come and read the clouds...

139
00:10:08,937 --> 00:10:10,899
...to predict the fate of the whole village.

140
00:10:10,962 --> 00:10:13,597
That cloud looks like a fluffy bunny.

141
00:10:13,662 --> 00:10:15,563
You better hope that's not a bunny...

142
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:19,142
...the fluffy bunny cloud forecasts doom and destruction.

143
00:10:19,211 --> 00:10:21,119
Do you even hear yourself?

144
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,416
The cloud reading will tell us if Mount Makapu...

145
00:10:23,462 --> 00:10:26,980
...will remain dormant for another year or if it will erupt.

146
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,228
We used to have a tradition once a year of going up the mountain...

147
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:35,022
...to check the volcano ourselves, but ever since Aunt Wu moved to the village...

148
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:39,852
...twenty years ago we have a tradition of not doing that.

149
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:44,262
I can't believe you would trust your lives to that crazy old woman's superstition.

150
00:10:44,296 --> 00:10:47,322
Shhhh!! She's coming!

151
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:54,420
Hey Aang, doesn't that cloud look like a flower?

152
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:58,059
Huh? Sure, I guess.

153
00:10:58,108 --> 00:11:00,957
Hey Katara, don't you think that cloud looks like a flower?

154
00:11:01,002 --> 00:11:03,229
Shh!!

155
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:14,660
Bending arrow cloud... good crops this year, nice big harvest!

156
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:17,037
Arg! Good news!

157
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:24,782
Wavy moon shape cloud... let's see? gonna be a great year for twins.

158
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:25,733
Yes!

159
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:30,981
And a cumulus cloud with a twisted nob coming off the end of it...

160
00:11:31,052 --> 00:11:37,559
...the village will not be destroyed by the volcano this year!

161
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:41,608
Since I got you here, uh, there's something I want to tell you.

162
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:46,108
I like you, but more than normal.

163
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:48,823
Never mind.

164
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:56,691
Hi, Aunt Wu. Sorry to bother you.

165
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:57,630
Anytime.

166
00:11:57,678 --> 00:11:59,789
About this man I'm supposed to marry...

167
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:02,799
...is he gonna be handsome? Oh, I hope he's tall!

168
00:12:02,837 --> 00:12:06,072
Ahh, you want another reading.

169
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:08,625
Yes, please!

170
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:14,910
I can't believe all these saps. Someone really needs to scream some sense at them.

171
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:16,757
They seem happy, Sokka.

172
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:21,351
Not for long. I'm gonna prove Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense.

173
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:25,259
Hey, you. I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear those red shoes, didn't she?

174
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:28,940
Yeh, she said I'd be wearing red shoes when I met my true love.

175
00:12:28,987 --> 00:12:33,710
Uh-huh. And how many times have you worn those shoes since you got that fortune?

176
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,593
Everyday.

177
00:12:35,623 --> 00:12:38,337
Then of course it's going to come true!

178
00:12:38,415 --> 00:12:43,670
Really? You think so? I'm so excited!

179
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:50,701
...and then you'll have your third great grandchild...

180
00:12:50,746 --> 00:12:56,144
...before quietly passing away in your sleep. Is that enough information for you?

181
00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:01,149
Wow, thanks Aunt Wu. Oh, wait, one more thing.

182
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,677
How warmly should I dress tomorrow?

183
00:13:03,746 --> 00:13:07,335
You want me to do a reading for that?

184
00:13:07,377 --> 00:13:14,159
I don't care what Aunt Wu told you, you have to take a bath sometime!

185
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:19,277
So, Sokka, you know some stuff about ladies, right?

186
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:24,106
Some stuff? You've come to the right place. What can I do you for?

187
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,471
Well, there's this girl...

188
00:13:27,744 --> 00:13:29,894
I think I know who you mean.

189
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:31,871
You do? And you're ok with it?

190
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,279
Of course I am. And, to tell you the truth,...

191
00:13:34,349 --> 00:13:36,896
...I've been picking up the subtle vibe that she likes you too.

192
00:13:36,975 --> 00:13:38,035
She does!?

193
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:42,697
Oh yeh, she's crazy about ya. All ya have to do now is not mess it up.

194
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:44,316
Well, how do I do that?

195
00:13:44,384 --> 00:13:48,709
The number one mistake nice guys like you make being too nice.

196
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,124
You can be too nice?

197
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:54,135
Yup. If you want to keep her interested you have to act aloof,...

198
00:13:54,196 --> 00:13:56,444
...like you don't really care one way or the other.

199
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,765
Well... okay.

200
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:01,329
Hey Aang, I was wondering...

201
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:04,130
See ya later.

202
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:07,740
Wow, that kid is good.

203
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:11,770
...and you'll be fine as long as you've got a scarf. Bye bye now.

204
00:14:11,821 --> 00:14:14,485
Okay, okay, but, one more thing.

205
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:16,770
All right, what is it?

206
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:21,429
Should I eat a mango or a papaya for breakfast tomorrow?

207
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:23,555
Papaya!

208
00:14:23,611 --> 00:14:26,028
Ohhh, I hate papaya.

209
00:14:26,094 --> 00:14:29,171
Oh, hey Katara. I didn't see you there.

210
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:31,012
Hey Aang.

211
00:14:31,098 --> 00:14:35,585
That's ok, I'm busy with my own stuff.

212
00:14:42,187 --> 00:14:45,267
Ugh. Papaya please.

213
00:14:45,331 --> 00:14:47,532
So... papaya.

214
00:14:47,576 --> 00:14:49,669
Uh-huh. Would you like some?

215
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:53,280
You know me. I don't really care what I eat.

216
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:56,700
Ok then. See you later.

217
00:14:57,427 --> 00:14:59,406
Maybe aloof isn't my style.

218
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:03,320
Oh! A panda lilly!

219
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:05,832
Did you see that?

220
00:15:05,883 --> 00:15:10,627
Excuse me. Where can a guy find one of those things?

221
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:14,652
I can't believe you're dragging me all the way up here for a stupid flower.

222
00:15:14,686 --> 00:15:20,857
Not just any flower... a panda lilly. I've seen it in action and boy does it work.

223
00:15:20,906 --> 00:15:22,943
Flowers are fine once you're married,...

224
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:28,687
...but at this early stage it's critical that you maintain maximum aloofness.

225
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:30,671
But my heart is telling me to get this flower,...

226
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:34,710
...and Aunt Wu said if I trusted my heart I would be with the one I love.

227
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:38,810
What? Don't tell me you believe in that stuff too.

228
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:41,359
Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet.

229
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:45,495
Why should she be wrong about love?*

230
00:15:45,552 --> 00:15:48,648
There, on the rim!

231
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:57,947
Oh no! Aunt Wu was wrong.

232
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,140
Those people all think they're safe. We've got to warn 'em.

233
00:16:10,217 --> 00:16:13,924
There's no time to walk. Grab on.

234
00:16:23,202 --> 00:16:24,368
Hi, Katara.

235
00:16:24,426 --> 00:16:28,446
Can you believe she won't let me in? And after all the business I've given her?

236
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:30,031
But, she doesn't even charge.

237
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,523
I know, but still.

238
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:35,971
Well, we have other things to worry about. Aunt Wu was wrong about the volcano.

239
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,612
Sokka, you tried to convince me she was wrong before.

240
00:16:38,682 --> 00:16:42,487
It's going to take an awful lot to change my min...

241
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:44,587
Oh, no!

242
00:16:44,693 --> 00:16:50,037
Everyone! That volcano is gonna blow any second. Aunt Wu was wrong!

243
00:16:50,113 --> 00:16:55,041
Yeh, yeh, we know you don't believe in Aunt Wu, "Mr. Science and Reason Lover."

244
00:16:55,116 --> 00:16:58,204
If you won't listen to him, maybe you'll listen to me.

245
00:16:58,265 --> 00:17:01,243
I want to believe Aunt Wu and her predictions as much as you do,...

246
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:04,671
...but my brother and Aang saw the lava with their own eyes.

247
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:10,519
Well I heard Aunt Wu's prediction with my own ears.

248
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:15,838
Please listen to us! You are all in danger! And we have to get out of here.

249
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:21,658
You can't rely on Aunt Wu's prediction. You have to take fate into your own hands.

250
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:26,364
Look! Can your fortunetelling explain that?

251
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:30,324
Can your science explain why it rains?

252
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:34,850
Yes! Yes, it can!

253
00:17:37,244 --> 00:17:39,488
They just won't listen to reason.

254
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:41,914
But they will listen to Aunt Wu.

255
00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:43,819
I know, that's the problem.

256
00:17:43,903 --> 00:17:48,484
Well, it's about to become the solution. We're taking fate in our own hands.

257
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:53,024
First, I need to borrow Aunt Wu's cloud reading book.

258
00:18:01,294 --> 00:18:05,182
Shh... we don't want anyone to hear us.

259
00:18:05,268 --> 00:18:08,653
Oh, oh! I didn't see you there.

260
00:18:08,747 --> 00:18:10,555
You don't like me. Do you?

261
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:12,234
Of course I like you.

262
00:18:12,328 --> 00:18:15,241
But not the way I like you.

263
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,739
Oh. I guess not.

264
00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:22,171
It's ok. It's just really hard when you like someone,...

265
00:18:22,264 --> 00:18:25,011
...but they don't think of you that way.

266
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:26,724
I know what you mean.

267
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:28,720
She's beautiful, by the way.

268
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:29,524
Huh?

269
00:18:29,613 --> 00:18:33,592
That water tribe girl. I can see why you like her so much.

270
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:41,102
She's sweet, she's a bender, and her hair seems so manageable.

271
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:42,110
Don't worry.

272
00:18:42,177 --> 00:18:46,537
You're gonna meet a great guy who's gonna completely fall for you. I know it.

273
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:51,505
Thanks. Wait! Don't you want this?

274
00:18:51,593 --> 00:18:52,764
How did you know?

275
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:56,187
I've kind of been stalking you... heh!

276
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,385
Oh, thanks. I... I guess.

277
00:19:02,132 --> 00:19:05,548
Clouds are made of water and air so between the two of us...

278
00:19:05,626 --> 00:19:08,708
...we ought to be able to bend them into any shape we want.

279
00:19:08,793 --> 00:19:13,007
I found it. The symbol for volcanic doom.

280
00:19:38,503 --> 00:19:43,207
Aunt Wu, look! Something is happening in the clouds.

281
00:19:43,296 --> 00:19:49,433
That's very strange. It shouldn't... Oh my!

282
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:59,813
We can still save the village if we act fast. Sokka has a plan.

283
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,263
Lava is gonna flow downhill to this spot.

284
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,517
If we can dig a deep enough trench...

285
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:06,573
...we can channel all the lava away from the village to the river.

286
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:09,466
If any of you are earthbenders come with me.

287
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:10,856
I'm an earthbender!

288
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:11,981
I'm not!

289
00:20:12,071 --> 00:20:18,236
Everybody else grab a shovel... come on, we've gotta hurry!

290
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:39,103
Dig faster! Dig faster!

291
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:48,260
Everyone needs to evacuate! We'll come for you when it's safe!

292
00:21:14,968 --> 00:21:19,270
It's too much! It's gonna overflow!

293
00:21:51,535 --> 00:21:55,475
Man, sometimes I forget what powerful bender that kid is.

294
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:57,589
Wait, what did you just say?

295
00:21:57,676 --> 00:22:01,990
Nothing, just that Aang is one powerful bender.

296
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:07,991
I suppose he is...

297
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:14,958
By the way, we kind of borrowed your book.

298
00:22:14,998 --> 00:22:19,985
So you messed with the clouds did you!

299
00:22:20,058 --> 00:22:21,995
Very clever!

300
00:22:22,082 --> 00:22:24,437
No offense, but I hope this taught everyone a lesson...

301
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,045
...about not relying too much on fortunetelling.

302
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:31,383
But Aunt Wu predicted the village wouldn't be destroyed, and it wasn't.

303
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:33,569
She was right, after all.

304
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:35,078
I hate you.

305
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:38,398
It's ok, Sokka. Everything's gonna be all right.

306
00:22:38,478 --> 00:22:40,105
Can I ask you something?

307
00:22:40,178 --> 00:22:41,638
Of course, honey.

308
00:22:41,696 --> 00:22:44,175
You didn't really see love in my fortune, did you?

309
00:22:44,249 --> 00:22:46,374
You just told me what I wanted to hear.

310
00:22:46,469 --> 00:22:52,035
I'll tell you a little secret, young Airbender. Just as you reshaped those clouds,...

311
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:56,664
...you have the power to reshape your own destiny.

312
00:22:56,756 --> 00:23:01,595
Goodbye everyone! It was so nice to meet you! Take care, Meng.

313
00:23:01,686 --> 00:23:04,831
Take care!

314
00:23:06,991 --> 00:23:09,505
Floozy.

315
