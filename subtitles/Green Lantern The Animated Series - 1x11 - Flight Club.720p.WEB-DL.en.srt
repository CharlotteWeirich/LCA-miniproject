Red Lanterns?

4
00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:28,963
Their power rings fire
some sort of red energy.

5
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:30,298
They have rings?

6
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:32,634
- Powered by what?
- Best guess?

7
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:35,303
A huge desire to mash us all into pulp.

8
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:36,404
Uhh!

9
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,631
Initiate gateway from the Lighthouse.

Not working.

00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:25,053
Are you using galactic
6 numeric translation of the phrase?

15
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,356
Of course.
You dare question me, Veon?

16
00:01:28,424 --> 00:01:31,559
My guard got the code directly
from the prisoner's mind.

17
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:33,895
It's...it's not our fault.

18
00:01:33,963 --> 00:01:36,397
Atrocitus will not tolerate excuses.

19
00:01:36,465 --> 00:01:38,700
We need that code to open the gateway.

20
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:41,236
The entire invasion depends upon it.

21
00:01:41,303 --> 00:01:44,906
So do our lives.

22
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:50,144
Are you sure none of you have seen it?

23
00:01:50,212 --> 00:01:52,814
It's a Lantern battery
for crying out loud.

24
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:55,516
It's not like it grew legs and ran off.

25
00:01:55,584 --> 00:01:59,520
I can't believe you, Jordan.
First you forget to charge your ring,

26
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:01,890
and now you lose your battery
like some rookie.

27
00:02:01,957 --> 00:02:04,859
I am receiving an incoming
transmission from Oa.

Guardian Appa Ali Apsa.

29
00:02:07,162 --> 00:02:09,697
After what he did to Ganthet, let
it go to voicemail or something.

30
00:02:09,765 --> 00:02:12,934
I don't feel like talking to that
backstabbing blue munchkin pain in the...

31
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:14,168
Ahem. Jordan.

32
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:18,439
<i>Yes, communication with you, 2814,
is equally unpleasant.</i>

33
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:20,708
<i>However, the Guardians have need of you.</i>

34
00:02:20,776 --> 00:02:24,078
<i>We have deciphered more of the red
lantern plans you obtained from shard.</i>

35
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:27,015
<i>The invasion will begin
sooner than expected.</i>

36
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:30,451
<i>Atrocitus plans to enter Guardian
space using the Lighthouse.</i>

37
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:32,220
That what now?

38
00:02:32,288 --> 00:02:34,522
<i>The Lighthouse was created
millions of years ago</i>

39
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,525
<i>by a lost civilization as a way
to travel through the Maelstrom,</i>

40
00:02:37,593 --> 00:02:41,729
<i>The asteroid barrier separating the
forgotten zone from Guardian space.</i>

41
00:02:41,797 --> 00:02:43,264
<i>When those ancients vanished,</i>

42
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:45,099
<i>the secret of the Lighthouse was lost,</i>

43
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:47,402
<i>sealing for countless millennia.</i>

44
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:50,638
<i>Some years ago a Green Lantern
archeologist named Tauverus</i>

45
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:52,407
<i>made the long trek to the frontier</i>

46
00:02:52,474 --> 00:02:54,142
<i>in hopes of finding the secret code</i>

47
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,411
<i>that would activate
the long dormant Lighthouse.</i>

48
00:02:56,478 --> 00:02:59,747
<i>Unfortunately, he disappeared
without a trace.</i>

49
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:02,150
And you're telling us this why?

50
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:05,553
<i>The Red Lantern armada is
headed full speed for the gate.</i>

51
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:08,156
<i>We believe Atrocitus
may already have the code.</i>

52
00:03:08,223 --> 00:03:11,392
<i>If his armada crosses the
Maelstrom into Oan space,</i>

53
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,228
<i>they will destroy
everything in their power.</i>

54
00:03:14,296 --> 00:03:17,886
<i>Your job, Green Lanterns,
is to get to the Lighthouse first</i>

55
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:21,836
<i>and destroy it by any means necessary.</i>

56
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:25,239
It's too bad we can't just ask
this Tauverus what the code is

57
00:03:25,307 --> 00:03:27,508
so we can destroy the
Lighthouse from the inside out.

58
00:03:27,576 --> 00:03:29,677
We can do precisely that.

59
00:03:29,745 --> 00:03:31,446
While interfaced with
the security system

60
00:03:31,513 --> 00:03:34,682
on the prison asteroid,
I downloaded their records.

61
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,486
An inmate named Tauverus is in
fact being held captive there.

62
00:03:49,164 --> 00:03:52,033
<i>Jordan, I hope you remember
how these yellow stones</i>

63
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:54,068
<i>make our rings completely useless.</i>

64
00:03:54,136 --> 00:03:55,737
Don't sweat it.
There's no one to fight.

65
00:03:55,804 --> 00:03:57,372
It's a friendly prison now, remember?

66
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,375
- Trust me.
- I hate it when you say that.

67
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:02,643
<i>Green Lanterns!</i>

68
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:05,880
<i>You have been gone too
many days. Too many!</i>

69
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:10,018
And you promised Goggan that
Goggan was only temporary warden.

70
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:13,821
Goggan work, work, work.
Goggan is a slave to work.

71
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:16,124
Maybe prison is better.

72
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:17,625
Goggan, this is important.

73
00:04:17,693 --> 00:04:19,227
We're looking for a prison that was here

74
00:04:19,294 --> 00:04:21,162
when Myglam and his
spiders ran the place.

75
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,831
His name is Tauverus, a Green Lantern.

76
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:29,404
The records indicate he is being
held on level H, sublevel 6D.

77
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:40,297
My circuits are
experiencing micro failures.

78
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:42,833
The yellow stones are very draining.

79
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:48,071
I'll take her back to Goggan's office.
She'll be safer there.

80
00:04:54,913 --> 00:04:57,347
Tauverus, I presume.

81
00:04:57,415 --> 00:05:00,584
Sad, sad. Very sad.

82
00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:13,764
Death by mind-altering torture device.

83
00:05:13,832 --> 00:05:15,799
If you thought you were going to die,

84
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:19,403
wouldn't you find a way
to pass on an important secret?

85
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:26,343
Wait.
Tauverus did leave us a message.

86
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:30,314
"If you want the code
to the Lighthouse, free Byth Rok."

87
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:32,482
[shudders]

88
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,118
Goggan, did you just ink yourself?

89
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:38,322
Byth Rok is a prisoner,
a Thanagarian prisoner.

90
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:41,658
Horrible, horrible birdman.
Dangerous! Brutal!

91
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:44,094
We put them in there, the birdcage.

92
00:05:44,162 --> 00:05:47,698
Guards go in, but guards
don't come back out.

93
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:50,133
Hawkmen?
I love Thanagarians.

94
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:52,002
They're real soldiers...

95
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,806
Organized, disciplined, and very clean.

96
00:05:55,874 --> 00:05:58,041
[all shouting]

97
00:06:04,082 --> 00:06:06,850
Clean? I don't think
they're even paper trained.

98
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:09,820
Outlaws and pirates.
Pirates and outlaws.

99
00:06:09,888 --> 00:06:13,056
All with prices on their heads
and death sentences.

100
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:14,491
Wasting time.

101
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:17,327
Go in, pull this Byth Rok out,
and get some answers.

102
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:20,931
Good idea... for you.
Goggan will watch from here.

103
00:06:32,844 --> 00:06:34,611
Ahh!

104
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:38,949
We're looking for
a Thanagarian named Byth Rok.

105
00:06:39,017 --> 00:06:43,220
I'm Byth Rok,
Valiant leader of these men.

106
00:06:43,288 --> 00:06:46,723
But temporarily not in charge.
A minor setback.

107
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:50,394
Right.
Look, we want...

108
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:51,929
Shh. The code to the Lighthouse

109
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:54,531
to get through the Maelstrom.
I know. Keep it down.

110
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:57,301
If these cutthroats think
you're here for something I have,

111
00:06:57,368 --> 00:06:59,436
they're gonna want their share.

112
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:03,974
So, Tauverus didn't make it.

113
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:07,367
Poor guy.
We shared a cell, you know.

114
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:10,404
He left the code with me 'cause
he knew I was a tough nut to crack.

115
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,973
Enough noise.
You're coming with us.

116
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:16,109
Not likely. They're not gonna
let you walk out of here with me.

117
00:07:16,177 --> 00:07:17,778
And I don't think
your Green Lantern rings work

118
00:07:17,846 --> 00:07:20,614
with all this yellow ore around,
so you can't blast your way out.

119
00:07:20,682 --> 00:07:22,950
But you have a suggestion.

120
00:07:23,017 --> 00:07:25,452
All you have to do is
challenge Bumpy to a fight.

121
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,621
Bumpy's the usurper in charge.

122
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:31,058
Don't worry, should be easy
for a big, tough guy like you.

123
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,994
You look like a fighter judging
by that face full of scar tissue.

124
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:35,796
Or were you born that way?

125
00:07:35,864 --> 00:07:38,732
Save it for Bumpy.

126
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,136
Got a challenger here.
This big flatfoot wants to fight Bumpy.

127
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:45,672
The wager?
He wins, I go free.

128
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,710
He loses, you get to take
my new friends here prisoner.

129
00:07:49,777 --> 00:07:51,879
[all chanting "fight"]

130
00:07:59,429 --> 00:08:01,763
[all chanting "fight"]

131
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:04,132
Wait, wait, wait.
Nobody's agreed to that.

132
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,570
Don't worry, Jordan,
this will be over real quick.

133
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:14,042
<i>Come on!
You can beat him.</i>

134
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,916

[both grunting]

136
00:08:33,863 --> 00:08:35,464
Your big man can really take a hit.

137
00:08:35,531 --> 00:08:37,799
- Oh, he'll win.
- No, not a chance.

138
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:39,568
Bumpy can't be beat, not like that.

139
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:42,571
His armor's made of Imp metal,
he's invincible,

140
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,806
and he cheats.

141
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:47,643
Uhh!

142
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:55,317

143
00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:58,487

00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:07,996
Dirty... flying...
[mutters]

146
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:10,232
Nicely done.
Nicely done.

147
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,667
Now, how about double or nothing?

148
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:14,836
My man here, this skinny Green Lantern,
wants to fight Bumpy.

149
00:09:14,904 --> 00:09:16,672
Avenge his friend's honor and all that.

150
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:20,609
If, by some miracle, he wins,
not only do I go free,

151
00:09:20,677 --> 00:09:23,345
but I get to be your
glorious leader once again.

152
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:26,248
And what do we get when I win?

153
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:30,986
If skinny here loses, we
forfeit our lives. All of them.

154
00:09:31,054 --> 00:09:32,487
Are you kidding?

155
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:34,356
Your lives were forfeit
the moment you walked in.

156
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:36,258
The only way out is if I'm in charge.

157
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,327
What about it, Thanagarians?

00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:39,528
<i>Yeah!</i>

One sec.
One second.

163
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:55,210
Look, under confidence has
never been a problem for me,

164
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:57,045
but my ring doesn't work here,

165
00:09:57,113 --> 00:10:00,048
and old Bumpy just wiped the
floor and ceiling with Kilowog,

166
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:02,884
who taught me most of what
I know about fighting hand to hand.

167
00:10:03,753 --> 00:10:05,420
I got you covered.

168
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:07,856
Bumpy can't see out of his right eye.

169
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:11,560
Use that to get on his back and hit
him really hard between the wings.

170
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:13,462
That's his weak spot.
It'll put him down.

171
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,898
If you knew his weak spot, why
didn't you finish him off before this?

172
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:19,501
Oh, that's how I ended up here.
He saw me coming.

173
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:21,036
My wings are just too big and beautiful

174
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:22,738
for even a half-blind lughead to miss.

175
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:24,673
You're scrawny.
He won't see you.

176
00:10:24,741 --> 00:10:25,874
Grr!

177
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:29,411
- This had better work.
- Trust me.

178
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,384
Well, strange being on the other
side of that saying for a change.

[groans]
Did I win?

186
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:29,271
Fellow, Thanagarians,
It's good to be back on top.

187
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:31,139
I am the King!

[all cheering]

189
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:39,047
Come on, your majesty, we had a deal.

190
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,917
The code to the Lighthouse,
if you please.

191
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:43,518
I am not pleased.

192
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:46,588
I've had a little thinksy about it,
and I've altered the deal.

193
00:11:46,656 --> 00:11:50,325
How about I pluck your feathers
and roast you like a fat hen.

194
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:53,128
Easy, Kilowog.
Let's hear the birdman out.

195
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:56,131
Now that I'm the leader of my group,
I need to think about my men.

196
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:59,434
They're a proud but simple folk
and need to be taken care of.

197
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:00,869
Touching.

198
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:02,938
So in exchange for
the code to the Lighthouse,

199
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:05,407
I want freedom for myself,
freedom for my men,

200
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,443
and Tauverus' Green Lantern ring.

201
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:14,149
- How about you take it from me?
- Deal.

202
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:16,852
You realize the ring ran
out of energy a long time ago,

203
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,254
and even if it were charged,
you couldn't use it.

204
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,289
I'll take my chances.

205
00:12:21,357 --> 00:12:24,659
I mean, look at it.
Such fine Oan craftsmanship.

206

[alarm sounds]

Oh! That's bad.
Very bad.

208
00:12:37,707 --> 00:12:42,878
<i>This is Bleez of the Red Lantern corps. 
Prepare for our arrival.</i>

209
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:49,008
<i>We demand to see
the warden immediately, </i>

210
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:51,410
or we will kill him and everyone else.

211
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:53,446
I'll give you one guess
what they're here for.

212
00:12:53,513 --> 00:12:54,713
You've got to get me out of here now.

213
00:12:54,781 --> 00:12:56,682
Right now.
Those guys are trouble.

214
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,652
- What about your men?
- Them? Forget them.

215
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:01,720
They just had me chained
for a wall for crying out loud.

216
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:05,591
Don't worry, I got an idea.
Warden, you're fired.

217
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,027
Oh, thank you.
Thank you! Thank you!

218
00:13:08,094 --> 00:13:11,597
They just said they wanted to see
and probably kill the warden.

219
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,733
Well, we'll just have
to hire a new warden.

220
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:27,847
Where warden?

221
00:13:29,616 --> 00:13:31,817
You're talking to him.

222
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:36,655
Not talking, ordering.
Take us to Tauverus now.

223
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:51,136
Jordan, you can't really
believe this pirate

224
00:13:51,204 --> 00:13:53,239
is gonna willingly give us the code.

225
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:56,842
Trust me. Hey, it does
feel better when I say it.

226
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,410
Byth, we accept your terms.

227
00:13:58,478 --> 00:14:01,413
We free you and your men,
but the ring stays with us.

228
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:07,286
Where I come from, we like
to look a man in the eyes

229
00:14:07,354 --> 00:14:11,290
when we shake on a deal.
Your helmet.

230
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:15,194
By the way, I'm in the market for
a new wife, and I'm not too picky.

231
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:17,696
My eighth wife, Mailbok, was a Salatio.

232
00:14:17,764 --> 00:14:20,868
Word to the wise,
never marry a Salatian. She...

233
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,302
Ahem.
Byth, the code.

234
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,805
Oh, right.

235
00:14:26,873 --> 00:14:29,375
Remember this well. It's
your key to the Lighthouse

236
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:30,910
and past the Maelstrom.

237

bow and aim true" in gau 7 numeric.

00:14:37,183 --> 00:14:39,685
Thanks.
Now, let's get you out of here.

240
00:14:51,197 --> 00:14:53,031
This way.

241
00:14:57,604 --> 00:14:59,538
Kilowog, keep an eye on Byth Rok.

242
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:02,708
Make sure he's...
Aw, nords.

<i>The secret code to the
oh, so lovely Lighthouse.</i>

247
00:15:13,536 --> 00:15:15,637
<i>So come down
and let's make a deal.</i>

<i>I am open for business.</i>

Something tells me we better leave.
And fast.

250

What will you do about Byth Rok?

251
00:15:23,212 --> 00:15:24,446
We don't have to worry about him.

252
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:27,315
Sounds like he's more than
capable of making his own deal.

253
00:15:27,383 --> 00:15:30,585
Too true.
The only problem is

254
00:15:30,653 --> 00:15:33,922
you Green Lanterns are part of my deal.

255
00:15:38,995 --> 00:15:41,596
For me?
You shouldn't have.

256
00:15:41,664 --> 00:15:44,332
But since you did, I like it.

Give us the code to the

With pleasure, beautiful.

260

"wings of life, fly to oblivion"

in gau 3 numerical, of course.
That's very important.

Now get out of my sight.

this sector, we'll skin you alive.

Glad we could help.
Aim for the roof.

Ahem.
One moment.

Men, my every thought and effort has been
to free you from this horrible prison.

So long, suckers.

314
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:07,662
- You let him get away.
- Yes. Yes, I did.

315
00:20:18,607 --> 00:20:20,508
[growls]

316
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:29,017
Back to the ship, now.

317
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:32,053
<i>We have to get that code
or the entire invasion fails.</i>

318
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:37,926
Grr!

319
00:20:50,773 --> 00:20:53,408
As soon as they're
out of range, we'll leave.

320
00:20:53,476 --> 00:20:54,709
I don't get it.

321
00:20:54,777 --> 00:20:56,244
We could never have won that fight.

322
00:20:56,312 --> 00:20:58,613
And Byth would only run
if it was his idea.

323
00:20:58,681 --> 00:21:03,218
You tricked him. Again.
I've underestimated your deviousness.

324
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:08,289
Good work, Jordan. You got the
code and we got to keep the ring.

325
00:21:08,357 --> 00:21:10,792
That... that thief!

326
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,129
Well, you did tell him he could have it
if he took it from you.

327
00:21:16,194 --> 00:21:19,401
Oh, such fine Oan craftsmanship.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
