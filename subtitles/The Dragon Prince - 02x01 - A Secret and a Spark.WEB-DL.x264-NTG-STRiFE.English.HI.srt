[Callum] <i>It feels like a
lifetime since we left home...</i>

13

<i>but it's only been a week.</i>

14
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:08,855
<i>We left because we found something
the world thought was destroyed...</i>

<i>the egg of the Dragon Prince!</i>

16

<i>Ezran and I decided to take a
dangerous journey across the world...</i>

<i>and carry this precious egg
home to its mother in Xadia.</i>

18
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,037
<i>Maybe then we can stop the war.</i>

19
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:30,710
<i>It's been an amazing adventure. I'm
even learning how to do magic!</i>

20
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:31,793
Ow!

21
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,050
<i>Though it hasn't
always been easy.</i>

22
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,303
<i>In fact, it's probably been the
hardest thing we've ever done.</i>

<i>But we haven't done it alone.</i>

25
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,808
<i>We've been traveling with
a new friend, Rayla,</i>

00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,810
<i>who is a Moonshadow elf.</i>

27
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,688
<i>Nothing I believed
about elves is true.</i>

28
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:56,653
<i>Rayla is kind and good. She's
fearless, fast, strong...</i>

29
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,947
[Rayla] <i>And daring.
Oh, so daring!</i>

30
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,283
Hey, have you just been
standing there the whole time?

31
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,869
[scoffs] Don't let me interrupt.

32
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,539
You were looking for another
good word to describe me, right?

33
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,376
Well, I consider
myself quite daring.

34
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,459
Quite?

35
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:17,131
Well, I'll be sure to tell my
stepdad how "quite daring" you are.

36
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,593
You're writing a letter...
to the king?

37
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,221
He'll be worried about us.

38
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:27,433
It'll mean a lot to him to know why
we left, and that we're doing okay.

<i>But something
incredible happened.</i>

44

<i>Now, instead of carrying an egg to
Xadia, we're taking care of someone new.</i>

<i>The most powerful creature

[Viren] <i>Dragons! The Xadian
threat grows every day.</i>

52
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,479
There have been sightings of
terrifying shadows in the clouds,

53
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,107
flying high above the towns
and cities of Katolis.

54
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,236
War dragons! We
must take action.

55
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,822
No, we should wait.

56
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,700
Xadia sent assassins and
they took the king's life.

57
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,244
And we must answer!

58
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,915
There hasn't even been the slightest
skirmish since then. Maybe that was it?

59
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,544
They've had their revenge, and
everything will just settle down now.

60
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:40,214
Settle down? Can't you
see the danger we're in?

61
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,719
[sighs] General Amaya reports
that elven forces are gathering

62
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,888
on the Xadian side
of the Breach.

63
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:51,559
We must be prepared to fight, and we
won't be able to fight them alone.

64
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,937
We must call for a
summit of the Pentarchy.

65
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,065
You're out of order, Lord Viren.

66
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,484
Only a king or queen
can call for a summit.

67
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,426
Frankly, I doubt the other rulers
will even look at a message

68
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,072
that doesn't bear
the king's seal.

69
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,991
But this is a crisis of
historic proportions.

70
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,243
Humanity could face extinction

71
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,789
if we don't work with the other
four kingdoms to do something!

72
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,833
None of that matters
while we have no king.

73
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:20,880
Therefore, our top and only priority
must be finding the princes.

74
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,800
Until we do, our hands are tied.

75
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,640
Come and get it, everyone.

76
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,103
Elves and humans over here,

77
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,314
and those with three or more legs
can sit there, with Phoe-Phoe!

78
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,650
You named her Phoe-Phoe?

79
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:45,488
She is a Moon Phoenix. Her name
is short for "Phoenix-Phoenix."

80
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,572
[Phoe-Phoe exclaims]

81
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:50,451
You have the best food up here.
What's your secret?

82
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:56,040
Well, my secret is...
is that it's all fake.

83
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,252
- What do you mean?
- You know, fake.

84
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,004
They're delicious illusions.

85
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,590
You're actually eating grubs.

86
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,050
[groans]

87
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:10,805
Oh, you must mean "grub." As in,
"Wow, this is some good grub."

88
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:15,184
No. Do you see what
Phoe-Phoe is eating?

89
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,812
- [Phoe-Phoe chomping]
- [Ezran] That bowl of worms?

90
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:21,649
[Lujanne] Yes, that's right.
Those are grubs!

91
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,692
[groans]

92
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,654
I don't care. [swallows]

93
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,991
This illusion pie is the
best I've ever had.

94
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,951
[Ezran retches]

95
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,120
Hey, everybody.

96
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,830
Well, you're in a good mood.

97
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,958
It does feel good to have
two working hands again.

98
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,004
- Uh... no offense, Ava.
- [barks]

99
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,382
I can slish and slash
with both swords again!

100
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,177
I can clap. [claps]
Do handstands...

101
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,475
I can even do that thing you do when you
finish a nice song and dance, you know?

102
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,226
[exclaims]

103
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,854
And how's everybody
else feeling?

104
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,481
- [Ezran] Amazing!
- Great!

105
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,232
- Fantastic!
- Good!

106
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,484
‘Cause it's time to go.

107
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,401
- [Callum] What?
- [Ellis] No!

108
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,087
- We can't!
- [Ezran] Why do we have to go?

109
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,821
We've only been here two days.

110
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,282
Danger's coming for
us, I know it.

111
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,993
The longer we stay here,
the higher the risk.

112
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,997
Hmm, she's right. The night
the Dragon Prince was born...

113
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,333
[sighs] I sensed
something amiss.

114
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,836
Those strange purple wisps...

115
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,963
Dark forces are pursuing you.

116
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,217
Nobody likes dark
forces, which is why...

117
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,847
- Making use of those two hands, huh?
- You bet.

118
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,059
Besides, we've got
precious cargo to deliver.

119
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,187
War is coming like the
world's never seen,

120
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,856
unless we get the wee
dragon home to his mum.

121
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,067
[Bait grunts]

122
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,321
But Zym, he's so little. He still
needs to learn how to fly.

123
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:55,117
[chuckles] You seem to have a special
connection to the dragonling.

124
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,161
Perhaps you could teach him?

125
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,413
Me? I could try.

126
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,959
And I was hoping to learn something
about Moon Magic while we're here.

127
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:07,088
Hmm. I could show
you some things.

128
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,465
Hey! I thought you
were on my side?

129
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,884
A few more days, Rayla,
that's all we're asking.

130
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:17,139
[sighs] Fine. One extra day.
One!

131
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,433
But I'm serious
about the danger.

132
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:23,729
I'll keep patrolling. Everyone
else, stay on your toes!

133
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:28,192
Except you. You work on
getting off those toes.

134
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,319
[yips sheepishly]

135
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,703
I can't believe I'm going to
learn magic from a real mage!

136
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,371
How do you know I'm real?

137
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,373
Uh...

138
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,875
Don't worry, I'm real.

139
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,671
This is the Moonhenge.

140
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,383
Thousands of years ago,
when Xadia was one land,

141
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:57,638
the ancient ancestors of Moonshadow
elves performed fantastic rituals here.

142
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,891
<i>Historia Viventem.</i>

143
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,397
[gasps]

144
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:22,204
[Lujanne] The legends say they
could use the power of the Nexus

145
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:27,168
to open a portal to another plane. A
shimmering world beyond life and death!

146
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,885
[Callum] But it's ruins now.
What happened?

147
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:41,432
The Moon Druids destroyed it themselves
when Xadia was divided in two.

148
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:46,145
They decided it was safer to
disable this magical place.

149
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,272
That's so sad.

150
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,860
Ever since then, there has always
been a guardian of the Nexus.

151
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:58,741
A mage, like myself, whose duty is to
prevent humans from discovering it.

152
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,746
What happens when humans do discover it?
Do you...

153
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,706
[exclaims] like, kill them?

154
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:13,255
[laughs] Nah, why kill them when you can
break their brains with insane illusions?

155
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,927
I've got some real mind melters. They
would completely freak your bean.

156
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,553
Interested?

157
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,429
I'll pass.

158
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,267
Okay, it's time to buckle
down and get to work.

159
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,436
[Bait chattering]

160
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,564
[Ezran] Flying is a natural
and beautiful thing.

161
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,651
Now, that doesn't mean
it's going to be easy.

162
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,611
[Bait grunts loudly]

163
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,738
You don't need to
keep doing that.

164
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,240
[Bait groans]

165
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,451
Ready, Zym? Wings out...
and flap!

166
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,162
[Zym grunts]

167
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,540
Come on! You have to
flap those wings.

168
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:49,749
[Zym groans]

169
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,627
Oh, no, are you okay?

170
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,088
[growls]

171
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,217
One more time. We'll
try it nice and slow.

172
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,511
[slowly] Flap...

173
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,514
[growls]

174
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:11,397
[chuckles] That's not flying, but
it's a very, very good start.

175
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,898
[scoffs]

176
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,743
[soldiers clamoring faintly]

177
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:42,279
"Oh, can't we stay a bit longer so
I can learn some magic tricks?"

178
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:47,284
And, "Oh, I wanna play around with
the wee dragon." [scoffs] Humans!

179
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:52,414
Only the noble elf cares about
keeping us all alive, apparently.

180
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:58,337
There's something out here, I know it.
Something bad.

181
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,964
[rustling]

182
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,384
[birds cawing]

183
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,483
[chittering]

184
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,319
[shrieking]

185
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:28,117
Ugh, you again. Save it
for someone who cares.

186
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,330
[whimpers]

187
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:40,588
And we're back. This time we're
here with a special guest.

188
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:44,425
She's mystical, magical, moon-powered
and she knows how to fly.

189
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,428
- [chirps]
- Please welcome Phoe-Phoe!

190
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,891
Ready, Phoe-Phoe? Show
him how it's done.

191
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,812
See? It's easy.

192
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,815
- [chittering]
- [Ezran] Yes! Yes, that's right!

193
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,071
Now, I'm going to show you
what flying feels like.

194
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,746
Can you feel it? Can you feel the
whoosh of the air beneath your wings?

195
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,457
[Zym chittering]

196
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,378
- He's doing it! He's amazing!
- Yes, yes! You can do this!

197
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,007
[gasps]

198
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,218
Ezran, you killed
the Dragon Prince!

199
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:32,681
Oh, no! I'm so stupid!
Oh, no, no, no!

200
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,186
[yips]

201
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,815
I'm so sorry, I wasn't trying to
hurt you, I promise. Are you okay?

202
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,942
[spits and chirps]

203
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,778
[groans]

204
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,074
[Lujanne] Though Primal
Energy is everywhere,

205
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:54,244
it may be weaker or stronger
at different times and places.

206
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,706
The ocean is strongest
at high tide,

207
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,252
sky is strongest in a storm,
and the moon is strongest...

208
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,587
When it's full!

209
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,507
Please don't
interrupt, but, yes.

210
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,845
And there is more. There are six special
places where the magic of Primal Energies

211
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:17,851
are most pure and powerful in this world.
Such a place is called a Nexus.

212
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:22,272
This is the Moon Nexus.

213
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,568
It reflects the moon perfectly.

214
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,948
When the moon is full, its light
completely fills the lake.

215
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,453
I love this. I love
learning about magic.

216
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,791
But I want you to teach
me to do some Moon Magic.

217
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,436
You know, maybe some
hands-on learning.

218
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:49,049
We get in there, you show me how to do a
moon beam, a moon ray, a moon... shine?

219
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,136
Humans can't do magic.

220
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,888
Um... but I did do magic.

221
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,975
Right, with a Primal Stone.

222
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:02,688
But then you smashed it, so now
you're just a standard human again.

223
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,483
Ah, but look on the bright side,
you've got those extra fingers.

224
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:10,154
The little ones, what do
you call them? Pinkos!

225
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,115
But I know other
humans who do magic.

226
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:19,204
We do not call that practice magic.
It's an atrocity.

227
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:24,626
This can't be. I thought
magic was my thing.

228
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,128
I was good at it.

229
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,423
It looks like you
could use some cake.

230
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,593
That's really a plate of worms.

231
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:38,807
[laughs] Ah, you're too smart
for old Lujanne's illusions!

232
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:44,229
How about some nice
old-fashioned iced-cream? Hmm?

233
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,690
[groans] Worms again.

234
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,236
[sighs]

235
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:56,533
So, he had a whole day of training.
Can he fly now?

236
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,912
No, not yet. I'm doing
my best, Rayla.

237
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,123
And so are you. I know you are.

238
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,919
Well, either way, we're
leaving tomorrow.

239
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,964
There's danger coming, I know it.
We have to get moving.

240
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,633
Then we should all
get some rest.

241
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,343
Nope, not for me.

242
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,805
I'm going out on patrol again.
One more perimeter check.

243
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:18,888
[exclaims]

244
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,226
[sighs]

245
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,396
- Tough day?
- You could say that.

246
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,484
Us too. Lots of jumping and
flapping, but no flying.

247
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:34,363
But we'll get it. No matter
how impossible it seems.

248
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:38,992
We believe in ourself, and
we're not giving up, are we?

249
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:44,414
Know what? Neither am I.

250
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,921
[crows cawing]

251
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,385
Crow Lord.

252
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:02,349
[clears throat] Crow Lord.
You! Sir! Crow Lord!

253
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,727
Oh! Sorry, I heard you
calling for the Crow Lord.

254
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,062
Uh, he's not here right now.

255
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,481
Then, who are you?

256
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,942
Oh! Well, I'm... I'm
the Crow Master.

257
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,906
It's sort of like... Assistant Crow Lord.
I just got promoted.

258
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,285
Congratulations. Are you
able to send the mail?

259
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,120
Sure! Sure, of course!

260
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:31,628
Oh, um... hmm. These... these
seem to bear the king's seal.

261
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,005
Yes.

262
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:38,218
Well, uh... yikes. Uh, the king is...
you know...

263
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,971
I can't send these.

264
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:46,560
Hmm. I understand your dilemma.
You were recently promoted, yes?

265
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,437
And you are trying
to do a good job?

266
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,022
Yes. Yes, exactly.

267
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:55,485
Right, well let me be
perfectly clear, Crow Master.

268
00:19:55,569 --> 00:20:00,157
You will send these to the leaders of
the other four kingdoms immediately.

269
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:05,120
If you refuse, you will also be...
you know.

270
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,081
Um, now that I think about it,

271
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,710
I'm just gonna go ahead and
take care of these for you.

272
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,087
Mmm, I thought you might.

273
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,798
[crow cawing]

274
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,683
[Callum] You're wrong.

275
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:30,187
Callum! What are you doing here?
It's late.

276
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,564
- I'm never giving up.
- Callum...

277
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:36,818
Growing up, I was supposed to learn
horseback riding, sword fighting,

278
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,197
archery, battle tactics, but
I was so bad at everything.

279
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,534
But then, you didn't give up?
And you got good?

280
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:49,998
Well, no, I gave those up, but then
I tried magic, and it felt right.

281
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,501
It felt like I was finally
good at something.

282
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,713
I will learn magic.
It's who I am.

283
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,676
Hmm. I admire your
determination.

284
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:04,304
But learning magic
is not your destiny.

285
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:10,602
You can't do Primal Magic because you
weren't born connected to a Primal Source.

286
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,021
I don't get it. What do
you mean, "connected"?

287
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:18,443
In Xadia, all creatures are born
connected to a Primal Source.

288
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:25,367
They have a piece of it inside them.
We call that piece an arcanum.

289
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,868
Wait, what's an arcanum?

290
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,706
It's like... the secret of
the Primal, or its meaning.

291
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,001
- The secret of the Primal?
- Yes.

292
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,170
That secret becomes a spark.

293
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:42,676
The tiniest possible flicker
of a Primal Source inside you.

294
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:46,013
But enough to ignite the
world with its magic.

295
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,097
[wind whistles]

296
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,058
All right, so what is it?
What's the arcanum of the moon?

297
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:55,731
It's something I just... know.
It's not easily put into words.

298
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:59,401
- Well, try. Please.
- Very well.

299
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,947
The arcanum of the moon is about
understanding the relationship

300
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:07,659
between appearances and reality.

301
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:13,623
Most people believe that reality is
truth and appearances are deceiving.

302
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,501
But those of us who
know the moon arcanum

303
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:21,173
understand we can only truly
know the appearance itself.

304
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,675
You can never touch
the so-called reality

305
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,470
that lies just beyond the
reach of your own perception.

306
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:30,974
I'm confused.

307
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:35,979
I don't blame you. After
