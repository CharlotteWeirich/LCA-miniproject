3
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:20,319
Good news, everyone!

4
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:24,123
We've been hired to make
our 100th delivery.

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,191
One hundred!

6
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,459
That's almost ten per year.

7
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,528
This calls for a party, baby.

8
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,231
I'm ordering a hundred kegs,
a hundred hookers

9
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,600
and a hundred Elvis
impersonators who aren't above

10
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,403
a little hooking,
should the occasion arise.

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,142
Be very gentle, folks.

12
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,045
This is the soufflÃ© you're
delivering to Mrs. Astor.

13
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:47,513
Oh, my God, it's Elzar!

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,715
Hi, Eelzar! Ooh, great soufflÃ©, Elzar!

15
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,885
Whatever you do, don't drop it.

16
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:56,321
See, Mrs. Astor takes
nitroglycerine for her heart,

17
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,689
and being a class act,

18
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:00,159
she prefers it in soufflÃ© form.

19
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,029
Bam.

20
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,231
To prevent the soufflÃ© from exploding,

21
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,966
Bender will carry it.

22
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,402
He's gyroscopically stable.

23
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,721
Look!

24
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:32,157
Mrs. Astor's mansion,

25
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:35,027
just across that rickety rope bridge.

26
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,265
Wow, it's ricketier than it looks.

27
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,167
You better try to jump it, Bender.

28
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:45,370
Okay, let me back up for a running start.

29
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,347
Here I go!

30
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,994
I shall inform Mrs. Astor
that the circus is in town.

31
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,530
Your soufflÃ©, madam.

32
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,134
I shall take it here, under my fork.

33
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,184
Mmm.

34
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,052
Where's the exploding?

35
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,623
One does not explode in Mrs. Astor's face.

36
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,358
I couldn't eat another bite.

37
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,559
Hobbsy?

38
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,098
Well done, sir.

39
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,332
Have you a name?

40
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,269
Hubert Farnsworth, at your service.

41
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,904
A Farnsworth, you say?

42
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,640
Well, if I'm not mistaken,
the Farnsworths have been

43
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,708
in New New York for almost 200 years.

44
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,410
Yes, I have.

45
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,611
And I'm his uncle.

46
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,281
How charmingly unconventional.

47
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,249
I can eat a hot dog underwater.

48
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,186
Say, would you Farnsworths
care to be my guests tomorrow

49
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,354
at the Astor endowment fund-raiser?

50
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,190
All the best families will be there.

51
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,891
We can take them.

52
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,772
On April 10, 2912, my late husband and I

53
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:30,475
set off down fifth Avenue
aboard the Land Titanic,

54
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,378
the largest street-going vessel ever built.

55
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,615
Just four days into her maiden voyage,

56
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,750
as we approached 32nd street,

57
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,154
the land liner struck a mailbox
and went down.

58
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,159
2,000 souls were lost that day,

59
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,294
including my dear husband.

60
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,363
In loving memory, I established

61
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,166
the Mr. Astor endowment, which this year

62
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,269
supports the united
mutant scholarship fund.

63
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,306
Mutants? That's the kind of thing you are.

64
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:04,009
Shh. You know mutants aren't
allowed on the surface.

65
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,412
If anyone asks, say I'm an alien, remember?

66
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,747
Oh, right. You gonna finish that roll?

67
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,215
Shh.

68
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,817
Now, a short film

69
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:15,754
about those pitiable creatures
so in need of our charity.

70
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,324
Far beneath the everyday rumble

71
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,460
of limousines and poodle feet,

72
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:25,197
there toil a downtrodden people
even less well off

73
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,668
than the upper-middle class:
The noble sewer mutants.

74
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:33,205
For, you see, generations
of exposure to toxic sewage

75
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,875
mutated them into horrific monsters!

76
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,278
- Ooh!
- Shut up.

77
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,481
These industrious,
uh, "people," I guess,

78
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,284
maintain the various pipes
and poop chutes

79
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:49,488
that keep decent, above-ground
society functioning.

80
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,290
And where do these proud toileteers

81
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,524
learn their menial skills?

82
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,827
At brown university,

83
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:59,331
the nation's premiere
institution of lower learning.

84
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,700
So please, give generously,

85
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:05,203
knowing some poor helpless
mutant will thank you.

86
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,606
Not in person, thank God.

87
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,576
Well, that was disturbing.

88
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,145
Oh, I understand, dear.

89
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:15,013
They are hideous.

90
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,350
Look, I guess you mean well,
but isn't that university

91
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,386
just a tax-deductible
sewer-cleaning service?

92
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:25,590
My dear, that school is about
much more than sewer pipes.

93
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,392
- Really?
- It's also about keeping

94
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,361
those filthy things busy.

95
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:33,065
There are thousands of them
down there, breeding like rats.

96
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,367
My great Uncle once saw a rat.

97
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,337
If we don't keep them busy,
they'll start jabbering about

98
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:41,006
equal rights in their ill-bred manner.

99
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,207
Let's go.

100
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,542
If I say one more thing,

101
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,444
I might say it with my evening boot.

102
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,013
Well! Rarely have I never!

103
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,781
Please, don't blame Leela.

104
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,184
She's just a little, uh, ill-bred.

105
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,052
You know how mutants are.

106
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,724
Your companion is a mutant?

107
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,526
But if anyone asks, say she's an alien.

108
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,862
Help! Police!

109
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,566
You may have eluded the authorities,

110
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:11,570
but don't nothing get past Mrs. Astor.

111
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,709
What's going to happen to me?!

112
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,345
Permanent deportation, you mutant.

113
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,714
You going downtown, baby.

114
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,182
Way down.

115
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,391
Incoming!

116
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:36,895
Thanks, Colonel.

117
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:39,030
Just doing my job, ma'am.

118
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:49,074
Oh, mom, dad, I can't believe

119
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:53,011
I have to spend the rest
of my life in this hellhole.

120
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,045
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,747
It's okay, sweetie.

122
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,482
Now that you're here,

123
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,518
this hellhole feels more
like a nice, regular hole.

124
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,787
What do you say
we go get some sewer coffee,

125
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,390
sewer cake and safeway ice cream.

126
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,131
Well, the bottom's all
stocked with cheap stuff.

127
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,533
Who's in the mood to party?

128
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,101
Whoo!

129
00:07:18,403 --> 00:07:19,503
Poor Leela.

130
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:21,505
I feel like I ruined her life.

131
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:23,040
You did ruin her life.

132
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,375
You might be right, Hermes.

133
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:25,409
I am right.

134
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:26,611
I almost feel like we should

135
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:27,979
do something to help her.

136
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:29,714
We should do something!

137
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:31,282
I don't care what you say, Hermes.

138
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,516
Let's go.

139
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:34,452
Oh, mighty Mayor,

140
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,387
we're here about Turanga Leela.

141
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:37,421
You mean Leela?

142
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:38,623
Right.

143
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,024
I mean, sure she's a mutant,

144
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,093
we've known that for years,

145
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,161
but we kept it secret 'cause
she's a fine, upstanding...

146
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:47,131
Wait. You knowingly
attempted to harbor a mutant?!

147
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,899
We did harbor a mutant!

148
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:50,234
Uh-oh.

149
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:52,770
Look, Leela, there's old filthful.

150
00:07:57,776 --> 00:07:59,410
And there's the West Side pipeway.

151
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:02,546
If those guys slack off for even a second,

152
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:03,948
it could explode.

153
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,116
Hey, guys!

154
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:07,118
This is my daughter Leela.

155
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:09,086
- Yeah. Oh, hey.
- How you doing, Leela?

156
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,858
Well, they're with the chuds now.

157
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:16,994
These conditions are deplorable.

158
00:08:17,062 --> 00:08:20,097
I swear, I hate every single person

159
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:22,800
on the surface
for making us live like this.

160
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:26,504
Leela.

161
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:28,105
What are you doing here?

162
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:30,007
We were sentenced to
two weeks in the sewer

163
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:31,809
for harboring a mutant.

164
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:37,581
Three dollars at the drug store.

165
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:39,650
I'm so sorry I ratted you out,

166
00:08:39,718 --> 00:08:41,886
but, you know, after two weeks down here,

167
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:44,855
I'll truly understand the
plight of the mutant people.

168
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:46,323
How dare you.

169
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:48,025
You want to understand something?

170
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:49,527
Look at that lake.

171
00:08:49,594 --> 00:08:51,962
One dip in that toxic muck

172
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,532
and your DNA will be permanently mutated.

173
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:56,634
You'll grow a camel hump
or a Zoidberg face.

174
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:00,137
You want to know what
it's like to be a mutant?

175
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:02,373
Jump in and go for a swim.

176
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:06,177
Um, I would, but I j... I ate
a bunch of potato salad, so...

177
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:08,412
Yeah, that's what I thought.

178
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,481
You are all surface.

179
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:18,956
Fry, Hermes.

180
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:20,391
Where my humans at?

181
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,826
Ah, who cares?

182
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:23,594
It is on.

183
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:27,364
Hey, hey, hey.

184
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:35,639
I trust the orgy pit has
been scraped and buttered?

185
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:38,375
You know it,
and there's mini-quiches, too.

186
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:42,213
It's getting cold and smelly.

187
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,415
My odor eaters are going critical.

188
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,320
Maybe we could plotz in that giant cockle.

189
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:53,624
Shmeepers, it's the Land Titanic,

190
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:57,328
the biggest and onlyest
land boat ever constructed.

191
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,565
This was one hell of a bus.

192
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:06,470
Well, everyone debone a
bunk and get some shut-eye.

193
00:10:06,538 --> 00:10:08,506
Zoidberg, show some respect.

194
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:10,107
This is a sacred shrine

195
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:12,309
to the thousands who lost their lives.

196
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:14,478
Hey, I found a safe.

197
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:17,648
It's coming loose.

198
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:19,817
Hand me some more of that cruise director.

199
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:29,260
The original passenger manifest.

200
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:31,896
Spreadsheets were so elegant back then.

201
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:34,165
Just one other item.

202
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:36,367
It's jewelry... jewelry!

203
00:10:36,434 --> 00:10:39,003
It's jewelry, people!

204
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,040
It's a priceless quantum-force gemerald.

205
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,378
What's that enscribbled on it?

206
00:10:47,445 --> 00:10:50,114
"My dear Mrs. Astor.

207
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:53,517
My love for you is
as unsinkable as this land ship

208
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:56,453
and as brilliant as this stone.

209
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:58,489
Dictated but not read, Mr. Astor."

210
00:10:58,557 --> 00:10:59,924
Aw.

211
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:01,659
That's so valuable.

212
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:04,428
I'll never have love like that.

213
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:06,463
Leela hates me now.

214
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:09,499
Did you guys know
I have a crush on Leela?

215
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:13,670
What's the matter, Leela?

216
00:11:13,738 --> 00:11:16,340
You've hardly touched
your toilet clams.

217
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:19,676
Maybe I was too harsh on Fry.

218
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:21,678
He didn't ruin my life on purpose.

219
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:23,113
Things will work out, honey.

220
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:24,614
Now, here.

221
00:11:24,682 --> 00:11:26,683
Have some more
of what looks like lemonade.

222
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:48,004
Bender, I've been to wang-dang-doodles

223
00:11:48,072 --> 00:11:49,873
all up and down the galaxy,

224
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:52,909
but this is the dangest
wang I ever doodled.

225
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:54,077
Oh, yeah!

226
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:56,380
Come on, baby, let's do it!

227
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:57,714
Shake your booty, baby.

228
00:11:57,782 --> 00:11:58,849
Come on! Yeah!

229
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,800
Get out! Get out!

230
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:18,468
It's not fun anymore!

231
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:19,936
I want to be alone!

232
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:21,104
Alone with me?

233
00:12:21,172 --> 00:12:23,273
I said scram, Grapey!

234
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,028
Fry? What are you doing?!

235
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:46,830
You were right.

236
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:48,799
I don't know what it's
like to be a mutant.

237
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:50,634
But I want to know.

238
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:53,069
Wait. I never meant for you to...

239
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:54,604
Oh, no!

240
00:12:57,809 --> 00:12:59,576
Fry! Fry!

241
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:00,911
No!

242
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:02,646
No!

243
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:06,716
Any effect?

244
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:10,954
Sorry.

245
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:12,489
I tried to scream, but I barfed.

246
00:13:15,893 --> 00:13:20,163
I think I'm knowing
what it's like to be a mutant.

247
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:22,799
So what's with all the screaming?

248
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:24,234
Hey, guys.

249
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,804
Fry, this is the stupidest,

250
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:30,206
sweetest thing you've ever done.

251
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:32,242
And you know, maybe now, together,

252
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,045
we can be an inspiration to other mutants.

253
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:36,746
I hope so, Leela.

254
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:38,214
Aw. Come here.

255
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:40,483
Let me give you a kiss.

256
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:42,185
Uh... hug.

257
00:13:42,253 --> 00:13:43,720
Handshake.

258
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:45,088
I'll text you.

259
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:48,758
My fellow mutants,

260
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:51,194
until recently, I dwelt on the surface,

261
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:53,997
where a man can gaze up
at the sky in wonder

262
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:56,166
without a wet clump falling in his mouth.

263
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:57,467
We can do that, too...

264
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:01,037
Who's ready to fight for equality?

265
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:05,108
The devolution
revolution has begun!

266
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:08,978
Beautiful mutants, please welcome... Devo!

267
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:13,950
Hello, sewer city.

268
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,987
As longtime mutants ourselves,

269
00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:19,956
we support your righteous struggle,

270
00:14:20,024 --> 00:14:22,125
and we'll do anything we can for you!

271
00:14:22,193 --> 00:14:23,193
Play "Whip it!"

272
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,995
No. Play the other one.

273
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:04,934
Now that we've got their attention,

274
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:07,003
it's time to hit them where they sit

275
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:08,938
by bending the West Side pipeway

276
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:11,374
to return all sewage to the surface.

277
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:18,014
But who could possibly
bend such a huge pipe?

278
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:20,083
So lonely.

279
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:22,485
Poor, sad Bender.

280
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:24,154
Hey, buddy.

281
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:27,690
Ah, what the heck?

282
00:15:27,758 --> 00:15:29,259
Mmm.

283
00:15:29,326 --> 00:15:32,061
Crowd
Bend it! Bend it!

284
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:34,764
Bend it! Bend it!

285
00:15:42,773 --> 00:15:45,308
What goes down must back up.

286
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:55,885
Yucks.

287
00:15:55,953 --> 00:15:59,289
I picked the wrong day
to wear my new crocses.

288
00:15:59,356 --> 00:16:03,359
Prepare to storm the surface
for the million mutant march!

289
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:07,530
Move out, Fry.

290
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:10,066
We need our most disgusting
mutant leading the charge.

291
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:11,401
I'll meet you up there.

292
00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:13,069
I need to check out something first.

293
00:16:13,137 --> 00:16:14,671
Okay. Vyolet, you're up front.

294
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:16,473
Hey!

295
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,442
Mayor, this sewer debacle

296
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,344
has gone on long enough.

297
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:24,113
As your largest campaign contributor,

298
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:25,682
I demand action!

299
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:26,883
Very well.

300
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:28,952
$80 worth of action it is.

301
00:16:30,287 --> 00:16:31,788
VoilÃ¡.

302
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:33,323
We simply pump the fruits of our excretion

303
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,258
into Madison Cube Garden.

304
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:40,096
Well, it seems everything is under...

305
00:16:44,902 --> 00:16:45,935
- Two!
- Four!

306
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:47,403
Six eyes!

307
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:49,939
The mutant people will arise!

308
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:53,209
The segregation
of the mutant people ends today.

309
00:16:53,277 --> 00:16:57,580
We demand equal rights,
equal access to the surface

310
00:16:57,648 --> 00:17:00,350
and the blood of your first-born children.

311
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:01,751
That's so we have something

312
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:03,386
to give up in the negotiations.

313
00:17:03,454 --> 00:17:05,488
I've never been so moved,

314
00:17:05,556 --> 00:17:07,724
and I see no reason to begin now.

315
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,359
Hobbsy, flush those creatures

316
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:11,694
back down the hole they crawled out of.

317
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:14,664
Madam's sewage-seeking missile.

318
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:36,853
Let my people stay!

319
00:17:44,161 --> 00:17:45,461
Neat.

320
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:47,931
Mrs. Astor, deep in the sewer,

321
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:50,266
we discovered the wreck
of the Land Titanic,

322
00:17:50,334 --> 00:17:52,101
on which your husband land-drowned.

323
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:54,837
Inside was something
that might interest you.

324
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:56,806
The gemerald ring

325
00:17:56,874 --> 00:17:59,042
my husband was to give me
in lieu of children.

326
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:00,743
Ah, so what?

327
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:02,812
I have a chandelier in
my car made of those.

328
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,013
Not the gem.

329
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:05,381
This passenger manifest.

330
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:07,450
It turns out there were
mutants on that ship

331
00:18:07,518 --> 00:18:10,086
working below deck in the sewage galley.

332
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:11,688
Ma'am?

333
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:14,657
I was just a young girl.

334
00:18:14,725 --> 00:18:16,725
Drain angels, they called us.

335
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:19,846
When the ship started going down,

336
00:18:19,914 --> 00:18:23,917
my mother grabbed me and made
for the nearest life car.

337
00:18:25,586 --> 00:18:29,856
But the places were all taken
by surface passengers.

338
00:18:29,924 --> 00:18:32,525
As my mother held me tight,

339
00:18:32,593 --> 00:18:37,397
I suddenly felt the gentle tap
of a cane on my face.

340
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:42,101
I turned to see
the kindly smile of Mr. Astor.

341
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:57,150
Thanks to your husband's humanity,

342
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:59,419
I lived to raise my own daughter,

343
00:18:59,486 --> 00:19:02,155
and she a daughter in turn.

344
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:04,857
Mom, why have I never heard this?

345
00:19:04,925 --> 00:19:06,659
My mother's nuts.

346
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:08,328
I beg you, Mrs. Astor,

347
00:19:08,395 --> 00:19:11,064
if you truly want to honor
your husband's memory,

348
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:14,767
treat these people
with dignity, as he did.

349
00:19:14,835 --> 00:19:18,137
Oh. He was a dear man... Mr. Astor.

350
00:19:18,205 --> 00:19:21,441
Randall, let's grant
these mutants their freedom.

351
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:22,976
Okay.

352
00:19:24,845 --> 00:19:26,879
Are we not men now?

353
00:19:26,947 --> 00:19:29,382
I'm 40% potato, but close enough.

354
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,950
Thank you, Fry.

355
00:19:31,018 --> 00:19:34,254
I think maybe I can stomach that kiss now.

356
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:40,360
What the...?

357
00:19:40,427 --> 00:19:41,660
Good afternoon. I am Mr. Astor.

358
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:44,981
I did not perish that fateful day,

359
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:47,417
but rather plummeted into the toxic lake,

360
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:49,386
where I mutated and lived in solitude

361
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,188
until this ruddy lad here

362
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:53,323
stepped into my mouth and lodged there.

363
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:54,891
Mister...?

364
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,693
Is that really you?

365
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:00,030
Hooray!

366
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,733
A happy ending for the rich people!

367
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:10,540
Mom, dad, grandma, this is where I work.

368
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:12,075
Oh.

369
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:14,111
Was there a fire?

370
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:16,079
So, Bender, how was the party?

371
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:18,148
Only the greatest party ever!

372
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:20,717
I don't need to have
another party in my whole life.

373
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:22,853
I am partied out!

374
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,821
Dang. Sorry we missed it.

375
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:27,124
We could have another one...

376
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:29,593
If it would make you guys feel better.

377
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,595
Really? Nah, that's not necess...

378
00:20:31,662 --> 00:20:33,597
Hit it, Bender!

379
00:20:56,587 --> 00:21:00,589
