<b>1x10 - Regime Change</b>

2
00:00:06,064 --> 00:00:08,004
<i>Previously on Green Lantern...</i>

3
00:00:08,036 --> 00:00:10,917
This threat may turn to be
nothing more than a few extremeses.

4
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:13,017
If the truth does come out,

5
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:16,588
many will wonder why it isn't
recorded in the book of Oa.

6
00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:20,959
Because, Sayd, history
is written by the victors.

7
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:32,837
So, you've come to gloat.

8
00:00:32,905 --> 00:00:34,272
That's not why I'm here.

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,108
The power ring chose you over me.

10
00:00:37,176 --> 00:00:41,146
You get to be the all powerful
Green Lantern Queen Iolande.

11
00:00:41,213 --> 00:00:46,651
And I, your poor, ordinary relation,
I get to decay in a cell.

12
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,053
I'd give back the ring if
it could change what happened.

13
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:51,222
You broke my heart, Ragnar,

14
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,424
the day you killed
Green Lantern Dulak

15
00:00:53,492 --> 00:00:55,193
and raised your sword
against me.

16
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:58,096
- And now I'm your prisoner.
- But also my brother.

17
00:00:58,164 --> 00:01:00,799
And I thought you'd like
a good meal.

18
00:01:02,168 --> 00:01:04,135
Get out!
Get out of here!

19
00:01:04,203 --> 00:01:06,871
I should be a Green Lantern, not you.

20
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:10,809
I hate you!
I'll destroy you all!

21
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:15,079
The Green Lanterns, you,
everyone!

22
00:01:18,717 --> 00:01:22,020
<i>Ragnar of Petrasis,</i>

23
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:26,858
<i>you have great rage in your heart.</i>

24
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,202
A Green Lantern force is leaving Oa.

25
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:40,772
Even in light of my concerns,
I persuade the Council.

26
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,374
Don't take it personally, Ganthet.

27
00:01:43,442 --> 00:01:47,478
Like you, Appa acts only
with the best of intentions.

28
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:50,014
I only hope it was a wise decision.

29
00:01:50,082 --> 00:01:53,318
In their absence, Oa is vulnerable.

30
00:01:53,385 --> 00:01:56,921
Hal Jordan and the other Lanterns
have been alone in the frontier.

31
00:01:56,989 --> 00:01:59,490
Now, in mere months they'll have help.

32
00:01:59,558 --> 00:02:01,793
In a year and a half they'll have help.

33
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:04,863
I may have a way to help them now.

34
00:02:06,398 --> 00:02:09,167
[dinging]

35
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:14,005
Green Lantern of sector 2814,
what is the reason for this call?

36
00:02:14,073 --> 00:02:15,940
<i>According to the files Aya downloaded,</i>

37
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:19,010
<i>there's a massive Red Lantern
fleet headed to guardian space.</i>

38
00:02:19,078 --> 00:02:22,480
<i>Naturally, we're wondering if you and the
rest of your blue man group have a plan.</i>

39
00:02:22,548 --> 00:02:25,350
We're deploying the corps
to defend against the invasion.

40
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:28,052
What?
You went right into attack mode?

41
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,622
<i>Did you actually read my
report or just skim it?</i>

42
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:32,757
Rest assured, your report
was submitted to the Council

43
00:02:32,825 --> 00:02:36,127
and taken into consideration.
What is your point?

44
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:40,131
My point is, the Red Lanterns are
convinced that your army of robot assassins,

45
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,868
the Manhunters, slaughtered their citizens
and annihilated their entire sector.

46
00:02:43,936 --> 00:02:46,738
They think it was a calculated
attempt to wipe them out.

47
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:50,174
<i>Yes, a dramatic
and emotional story to be sure.</i>

48
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:54,045
<i>Atrocitus is merely using
propaganda to rally his troops.</i>

49
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:56,481
But if this whole invasion
is based on lies,

50
00:02:56,548 --> 00:02:58,750
wouldn't that be a reason
to try diplomacy?

51
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:01,252
If we could convince them
of the truth...

52
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,354
<i>Do not presume
to question us, 2814.</i>

53
00:03:03,422 --> 00:03:05,890
<i>The Guardians are the
greatest minds of the universe</i>

54
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,559
<i>and have come to this decision as one.</i>

55
00:03:08,627 --> 00:03:10,228
Jordan, you've got to hear this.

56
00:03:10,296 --> 00:03:13,932
We have picked up an SOS signal
originating from planet Petrasis.

57
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:16,000
<i>2814, what's going on?
Explain...</i>

58
00:03:16,068 --> 00:03:18,569
Sorry, got to take this.
We'll finish later.

59
00:03:18,637 --> 00:03:21,205
<i>This is Queen Iolande of Petrasis.</i>

60
00:03:21,273 --> 00:03:22,807
<i>We are under attack by Red Lanterns</i>

61
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,043
<i>and desperately need
immediate assistance.</i>

62
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,812
<i>Please come.</i>

63
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:50,768
Iolande?

64
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:53,771
Guess again.

65
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:56,474
- Ragnar.
- He's a Red.

66
00:03:56,542 --> 00:04:00,078
Like the outfit? I have you
to thank for it after all.

67
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:02,947
[growls]

68
00:04:03,015 --> 00:04:04,949
I used to think being
a Green Lantern

69
00:04:05,017 --> 00:04:06,985
would give me everything
I ever wanted.

70
00:04:07,052 --> 00:04:09,721
But I wasn't good enough, was I?

71
00:04:09,788 --> 00:04:12,056
Well, it turns out my
hate for the Green Lanterns

72
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:16,661
did give me everything
I ever wanted. And more.

73
00:04:23,202 --> 00:04:26,170
I rule Petrasis, as it should be.

74
00:04:26,238 --> 00:04:28,473
Where's Iolande?

75
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,908
Don't worry, she's perfectly fine.

76
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:35,346
Or should I say perfectly confined?

77
00:04:35,414 --> 00:04:37,782
We're not leaving here
without the Queen.

78
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,719
Kill them!
[all grunting]

79
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:51,696
Aah!

80
00:04:56,902 --> 00:05:00,038
Uhh!

81
00:05:00,105 --> 00:05:01,372
Aah!

82
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,241
Oh!

83
00:05:04,176 --> 00:05:06,277
[grunts]

84
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:10,915
Ahh!

85
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,523
Correct me if I am wrong,
but is a withdrawal not in order?

86
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,591
[grunts]

87
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:24,962
We're getting creamed out here.

88
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,899
If we don't pull back now, we're
dead and the mission's over.

89
00:05:29,568 --> 00:05:33,604
- Ok, let's blow this montour stand.
- Hey, that's my line.

90
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,078
Uhh!

91
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,250
Uhh!

92
00:05:58,097 --> 00:06:01,966
The Red Lanterns have blocked
our access to the ship.

93
00:06:02,034 --> 00:06:04,869
That's what we get for
parking in a bad neighborhood.

94
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:16,414
Let's go.

95
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:29,861
Hello, Green Lantern.

96
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:34,198
You've made a fatal decision
returning to Petrasis.

97
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,848
Kothak, after all
that we've been through,

98
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,850
you still want to kill me?

99
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:52,327
I'm trying to keep us
from being spotted.

100
00:06:52,395 --> 00:06:55,497
Come. Their patrols
are hard enough to avoid

101
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:58,567
without a Red Lantern
manhunt going on.

102
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:04,172
Ragnar and his new friends captured
Iolande and took over Petrasis.

103
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,042
I've been leading the resistance since.

104
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:12,314
But yesterday things went
from bad to unthinkable.

105
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:15,383
I've heard them call it a Liberator.

106
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:18,920
- Can you imagine?
- Yes. Yes, I can.

107
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:21,256
We must do something immediately.

108
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:23,658
That device will blow
this planet to dust.

109
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:28,029
So you've dealt with these before.
How did you defeat it?

110
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:31,399
Uh, that one didn't go so good.

111
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:36,304
- Then you are less than useless.
- Not quite.

112
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:40,408
You must disarm the weapon
before it destroys Petrasis.

113
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:44,846
This is not a sparsely populated colony,
it is a planet of 2 billion.

114
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:46,982
<i>Maybe there's a way
to diffuse the situation,</i>

115
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,417
<i>show the Red Lanterns
that Atrocitus has been lying</i>

116
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:51,353
<i>through his weird teeth all along.</i>

117
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,655
What are you speaking of?

118
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,109
<i>The Red Lanterns believe this
crazy story where billions of</i>

119
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,495
<i>years ago you guys sent an army
of killer robots to wipe them out.</i>

120
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,331
<i>Atrocitus told everyone,
so they want revenge.</i>

121
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,401
<i>If we could convince them he's lying,
we could stop this war.</i>

122
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:11,506
We cannot do that.
Because it did happen.

123
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:16,111
<i>Wha...
I mean, the robots were real?</i>

124
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:18,580
<i>And killed all those people?</i>

125
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:22,951
The Manhunters were created
by the Guardians long ago.

126
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:27,622
<i>They were the forerunners
of the Green Lantern corps.</i>

127
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,860
<i>For awhile the Manhunters
were the perfect police force.</i>

128
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:36,097
<i>They were never swayed by emotion,
only right and wrong.</i>

129
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:39,501
<i>But this is not a universe of absolutes.</i>

130
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,671
<i>Their inability to understand</i>

131
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:46,308
<i>and interact with emotional beings
ended in tragedy.</i>

132
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:50,312
<i>The Manhunters destroyed
people, planets, entire sectors,</i>

133
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:54,649
forming what we now call
the forgotten zone.

134
00:08:54,717 --> 00:08:58,219
The Manhunters are
our greatest shame,

135
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,588
the Guardians' darkest secret.

136
00:09:00,656 --> 00:09:03,892
It's time for the source
of collected guardian guilt

137
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,027
to face the light of day.

138
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:08,630
You focus on disarming
the Liberator.

139
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:13,368
I may be able to assist you,
but I must first speak with Appa.

140
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:16,237
<i>We're counting on you, Ganthet.</i>

141
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:20,141
Hey, Red, any chance
you and I can get our ship back?

142
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:23,278
I believe we can handle
that little errand.

143
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:29,317
Kothak, we have a Queen
to rescue and a bomb to disarm.

144
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:32,754
The fact is we will never be
able to end this Red Lantern threat

145
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:36,057
without admitting to our own
tragic part in their history.

146
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:40,061
You indulge in guilt, Ganthet.
It clouds your better judgment.

147
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:44,733
The Council, you with us,
decided silence was best.

148
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,435
The corps only need know
what we tell them.

149
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,872
We must not allow Petrasis
to pay the price for our sins.

150
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,108
The loss of a planet,
however unfortunate,

151
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,343
is inconsequential
against maintaining

152
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,612
peace and order
on a million others.

153
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,382
I disagree strongly
with your moral calculus.

154
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:02,884
And there is still hope for Petrasis.

155
00:10:02,952 --> 00:10:05,353
Before Hal Jordan
borrowed the interceptor...

156
00:10:05,421 --> 00:10:06,755
Stole, you mean.

157
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:13,862
- Ahh. At your urging.
- I put something aboard,

158
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:17,098
something that could boost
their power exponentially

159
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,967
should the need arise.

160
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,469
Not your prototype.

161
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,773
Ganthet, an experimental device
based on a theory

162
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,510
about hope and will
is emotional madness.

163
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:31,079
And to do this without
the Council's knowledge?

164
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:35,116
Hal Jordan needs our help.
We must act now.

165
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:40,522
Perhaps you are right, Ganthet.
It is time for the truth to come out.

166
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,611
[beep]

167
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:09,651
- Hal.
- Come on, there's not much time.

168
00:11:09,718 --> 00:11:11,519
Guardians of Oa,

169
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:15,590
you have been called here
to discuss a grave matter.

170
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:18,993
There has been an unforgivable
breach of trust

171
00:11:19,061 --> 00:11:21,162
that must be brought to light.

172
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,467
What he says is true enough.
There is a traitor among us.

173
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:29,637
And his name is Ganthet.

174
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:31,139
Consider what you are doing.

175
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:34,743
Silence. According to Guardian
law, the accused will not

176
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:38,279
speak before the charges are
brought before the Council.

177
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:41,866
By his own admission, Ganthet
aided and allowed Hal Jordan

178
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,386
to take the interceptor
without Council approval.

179
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:50,558
But worst of all is Ganthet's
blatant use of an unreliable emotion.

180
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:54,796
It is true.
I believe willpower is not enough.

181
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:58,199
We need hope.
We all need hope.

182
00:11:58,267 --> 00:12:03,805
Embracing a base emotion is a violation
of the trues that we hold sacred.

183
00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:06,841
And for that, you are banished.

184
00:12:20,222 --> 00:12:23,057
I'm sorry for getting
you all into this mess.

185
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,828
Oh, don't apologize.
We love this kind of stuff.

186
00:12:33,135 --> 00:12:36,371
What are you doing here?
The Liberator is under attack.

187
00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:39,974
They think me weak?
Kill Iolande.

188
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:43,811
Dunce! Your sister is one of the
Green Lanterns attacking the device.

189
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,346
Grr!

190
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:48,883
Send everyone!
I will lead the counterattack.

191
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:57,592
<i>All units report
to the Liberator at once.</i>

192
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:05,767
Your treachery threatens
everything we believe in.

193
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:09,704
I am not the threat here,
Ganthet. You are.

194
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:11,072
The citizens of guardian space

195
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,708
put their trust in us,
come to us for guidance.

196
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:16,878
What would happen if they learned
the truth about the forgotten zone?

197
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:19,731
All order would be lost.
There would be chaos and suffering

198
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,517
beyond anything the Manhunters had done.

199
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:25,553
You maintain a lie.

200
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:29,341
Ganthet, you are hereby
banished, sentenced to live out

201
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:33,061
the rest of your days cut off
from your species and civilization.

202
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:36,698
I almost feel the base emotion
pity for you.

203
00:13:36,765 --> 00:13:42,604
Only almost, though, Appa?
And there's the pity.

204
00:13:51,513 --> 00:13:53,681
[gunfire]

205
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:01,789

[all grunt]

207
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,335
Hold on. I've still got
an ace up my sleeve.

208
00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:16,004
<i>[dinging]
Guardians of Oa,</i>

209
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:19,307
<i>this is Green Lantern of sector 2814
calling for Ganthet.</i>

210
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,908
<i>I need immediate assistance.</i>

211
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:23,845
I'm afraid Ganthet
is no longer with the Council.

212
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:25,346
<i>Where is he?</i>

213
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:30,952
My apologies, 2814, but as you
say, I must got to take this.

214
00:14:32,254 --> 00:14:37,058
- What did they say?
- We're on our own.

215
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:50,859
They're closing in!

216

[growls]

00:14:58,702 --> 00:15:01,637
Aah!

00:15:11,114 --> 00:15:12,848
Ahh! Ohh!

219
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,717
Ahh!

220
00:15:20,624 --> 00:15:23,993
- Excellent aim.
- Thank you.

221
00:15:26,563 --> 00:15:28,831
Yah!

222
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:32,067
The cavalery has arrived.

223
00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:18,647
- Sayd.
- Ganthet, I've come to trust you.

224
00:16:18,715 --> 00:16:21,717
I reprogrammed the ship's destination.

225
00:16:23,553 --> 00:16:26,288
You could be banished
for what you've done.

226
00:16:26,356 --> 00:16:31,360
If there's a chance we can
help Hal Jordan, we must try.

227
00:16:34,497 --> 00:16:37,066
It's sealed.

228
00:16:40,036 --> 00:16:43,038
Get that door open.

229
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:03,592
Aah!

230
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,229
<i>Warning.

- I don't know, Sayd.

233
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:57,379
But we must have hope.

234
00:17:58,615 --> 00:18:03,786
You've lost, dear sister.
I am the ruler of Petrasis.

Uhh!

00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,551
Huh?

00:18:43,193 --> 00:18:44,827
Ahh!

00:18:56,506 --> 00:18:58,373
Aah!

Aah!

Aah!

That's never happened before.

It's... it's a miracle.

Hoo hoo! Yeah!

- It's about to blow.

If we can't disarm it,
we'll get rid of it.

You've got to be kidding.
How are we supposed to lift this?

00:19:58,601 --> 00:20:01,570
I can get used to this.

You don't think that whole blue
light show was Ganthet, do you?

255
00:20:31,734 --> 00:20:35,938
I don't know what just happened.
But I'm glad it did.

But still, I must leave Oa.

It did.
I can feel it.

- Telepathy, Ganthet?
- No. Hope.
