4
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:30,405
(mechanical whirring)

5
00:00:32,976 --> 00:00:35,243
Mom on deck!
Ten...

6
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:36,045
(grunts)

7
00:00:36,113 --> 00:00:37,446
All right, grunts,

8
00:00:37,514 --> 00:00:39,715
here's your
pre-mission pep talk.

9
00:00:39,783 --> 00:00:41,750
Shoot anyone
who doesn't obey hard enough.

10
00:00:42,618 --> 00:00:43,552
But...

11
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:47,156
Stop gaining
knowledge, Hubert.

12
00:00:47,224 --> 00:00:48,257
(grunts)

13
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:49,859
It's a simple mission.

14
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:52,428
The grunts catch the alien,
the surgeon guts it,

15
00:00:52,496 --> 00:00:54,563
and you smuggle
the poison parts back here.

16
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:57,099
Uh, something
about poison, got it.

17
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:59,034
By the way, that surgeon--

18
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:00,169
where is he?

19
00:01:00,237 --> 00:01:02,037
You! Where's the butcher?

20
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:03,405
Ma'am, I don't know, ma'am.
His duffel bag arrived.

21
00:01:03,473 --> 00:01:04,773
(Zoidberg groans)

22
00:01:04,841 --> 00:01:05,975
ZOIDBERG:
It's not a duffel bag.

23
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:06,976
It's my apartment!

24
00:01:08,678 --> 00:01:10,679
Hubert, meet John Zoidberg.

25
00:01:10,747 --> 00:01:12,348
You need an alien
hacked to pieces,

26
00:01:12,415 --> 00:01:14,116
he's the best there is...

27
00:01:14,184 --> 00:01:15,684
in the budget category.

28
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:18,287
Have you ever dissected
a yeti before?

29
00:01:18,355 --> 00:01:20,523
(chortles)
Himalayan or Neptunian?

30
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,358
Tritonian.
(gasps)

31
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:24,126
A Tritonian yeti?

32
00:01:24,194 --> 00:01:25,895
You two aren't up
to anything unethical,

33
00:01:25,962 --> 00:01:27,630
- are you?
- Relax.

34
00:01:27,697 --> 00:01:29,265
There's nothing unethical

35
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:31,700
about covert
biological weapons research.

36
00:01:32,268 --> 00:01:33,269
I said relax!

37
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:36,138
(both gasp)

38
00:01:36,206 --> 00:01:37,640
(Owls hooting)

39
00:01:37,707 --> 00:01:41,210
Ah, Zoidberg, we've
known each other so long

40
00:01:41,278 --> 00:01:44,180
that sometimes I don't
think we even need words

41
00:01:44,247 --> 00:01:45,581
to understand
each other.

42
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,649
What?

43
00:01:50,854 --> 00:01:52,121
Once and for all, Fry,

44
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:53,489
even though it's the future,

45
00:01:53,557 --> 00:01:55,791
most objects
are still just objects,

46
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:58,227
not aliens who
look like objects.

47
00:01:58,295 --> 00:02:00,462
So my efforts to establish
diplomatic relations

48
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,065
with the Cactus People
were doomed from the start.

49
00:02:05,735 --> 00:02:08,671
So you're in pain
and have a bunch of needles?

50
00:02:08,738 --> 00:02:11,240
I prescribe acupuncture.
Let's begin.

51
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:12,674
(Fry screams)

52
00:02:12,742 --> 00:02:13,942
Blood?!

53
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,744
I mean... blood.

54
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:16,779
Put it back in me!

55
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:20,983
I'm afraid Fry lost
a lot of juice.

56
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,218
He's developed
Simpson's Jaundice.

57
00:02:23,286 --> 00:02:24,686
Ay carumba.

58
00:02:24,754 --> 00:02:26,822
His only hope
is some replacement liver.

59
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,991
Yours looks like a good match.

60
00:02:29,058 --> 00:02:30,659
Well, if it'll help Fry...

61
00:02:30,727 --> 00:02:32,094
Careful, Leela!

62
00:02:32,162 --> 00:02:33,996
He knows less about
human anatomy than I do.

63
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:36,865
And I can't even
find my own uterus.

64
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:39,802
You may feel a slight sawing.

65
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:41,637
<i>And all we need</i>

66
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,872
is a little spine supplement

67
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,342
to replace what Leela lost
in that unavoidable saw mix-up.

68
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,344
It wasn't unavoidable.

69
00:02:49,412 --> 00:02:51,413
You just had to stop
cutting my spine

70
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:54,349
when I yelled "Stop,
you're cutting my spine!"

71
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:56,018
FRY:
Quit complaining.

72
00:02:56,085 --> 00:02:57,920
My body rejected your liver,

73
00:02:57,987 --> 00:02:59,621
and now I've got
Garfield Syndrome.

74
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:01,824
Oh, I hate Mondays.

75
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:03,759
Anyhow, Hermes,
all Leela needs

76
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:05,527
is one of your vertebrae.

77
00:03:05,595 --> 00:03:08,430
But Doctor, will I be able
to limbo afterwards?

78
00:03:08,498 --> 00:03:09,965
Could you limbo before?

79
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:11,367
(laughing)

80
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:12,427
Wait.

81
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:13,702
I say, "Yes,"

82
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,271
and you say,
"I couldn't limbo before."

83
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:17,739
You ruined
the joke, Hermes.

84
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:21,743
There you go, Leela.
Good as new!

85
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:24,379
Whoa. Whoa...

86
00:03:24,447 --> 00:03:26,315
Oh, sure, Leela's fine,

87
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:29,184
but my jaundice has progressed
to Muppet Gangrene!

88
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:31,053
It's not easy being gangrenous.

89
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,590
I thought you were only gonna
take out one vertebra!

90
00:03:34,657 --> 00:03:36,625
Yeah, but did
you ever play Jenga?

91
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:39,628
Sometimes you pull one and...
(imitates crashing)

92
00:03:39,696 --> 00:03:43,632
You don't know what you're doing!
I want my back back! (Shouting)

93
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,468
Hmm. What started out
as a pleasant afternoon

94
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:49,338
of drugs and surgery
has not gone as planned.

95
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:52,307
But don't worry, we still have
three or four co-workers

96
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,209
with plenty of spare parts.

97
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:59,348
My first mission.
I'm so excited.

98
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:01,483
And after I dissect
the yeti's poison glands,

99
00:04:01,551 --> 00:04:04,319
we can stop, maybe,
for ice cream on the way back?

100
00:04:04,387 --> 00:04:05,621
With shprinkles on?

101
00:04:05,688 --> 00:04:06,722
(laughing)

102
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:08,824
Why, you're just a big kid,

103
00:04:08,892 --> 00:04:10,225
aren't you, Zoidberg?

104
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,927
A very big kid.

105
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:14,296
We're over the drop
zone, gentlemen.

106
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:17,165
Might I suggest you jump out
the door and poop yourselves?

107
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:22,170
(Men grunting)

108
00:04:22,238 --> 00:04:25,340
(Zoidberg screaming)

109
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:27,643
So anyway, I hope the
men have been taking

110
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,344
their hypermalaria pills.

111
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:30,612
Their wha--?

112
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,247
Their "wha--"?

113
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:33,682
(laughing)

114
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,984
That's funny,
like a crazy old man.

115
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:37,619
But you know
what's not funny?

116
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:39,855
Deadly Tritonian
hypermalaria.

117
00:04:39,923 --> 00:04:42,257
Just be sure to stay out
of the methane swamps.

118
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,495
(sniffing)

119
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:49,197
What smells like methane?

120
00:04:49,265 --> 00:04:51,400
(people groaning in pain)

121
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:53,468
My God.

122
00:04:53,536 --> 00:04:55,437
I've never seen such
a gruesome shark attack.

123
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:56,772
Especially this
far inland.

124
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,307
It wasn't a shark.

125
00:04:58,374 --> 00:05:00,442
It was an awful,
incompetent doctor.

126
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,444
Wow, he must've been
a total Zoidberg.

127
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:03,946
It was Zoidberg.

128
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,847
He brutalized us
with power tools,

129
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:08,216
gypsy curses and hypnosis.

130
00:05:08,284 --> 00:05:10,252
Yes, master.

131
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,520
You'll all get
through this.

132
00:05:11,588 --> 00:05:13,322
I give you my word
as a real doctor.

133
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:14,423
What about me?

134
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,757
What did he do to you?

135
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:17,459
I don't know
exactly, but

136
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,361
(whispers):
I'm incontinent.

137
00:05:19,429 --> 00:05:21,296
I'm truly sorry.

138
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:23,398
I consider myself
a reasonable man.

139
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:25,500
Quick with a joke,
slow to anger.

140
00:05:25,568 --> 00:05:27,803
But Bender can't go
on long car trips anymore,

141
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,671
and I say Zoidberg must die.

142
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:30,872
People, please.

143
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,841
Let's not overreact.

144
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,676
Death to the crab.

145
00:05:40,998 --> 00:05:41,799
How bad is it, Doctor?

146
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:43,134
Super bad.

147
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:45,136
It's Tritonian
hypermalaria.

148
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:47,671
A lot of these men will
be dead within 24 hours.

149
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:48,706
What?!

150
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:50,074
Not you, though.

151
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,809
You'll make a complete recovery

152
00:05:51,877 --> 00:05:53,811
and go on to marry a supermodel!

153
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,312
(sighs)

154
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,281
Funny plague,
hypermalaria.

155
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:00,351
It can kill immediately,
or lie dormant for decades.

156
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,753
But sooner or later,
it erupts,

157
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,189
causing fever,
spasms, madness,

158
00:06:05,257 --> 00:06:07,858
coma,
and finally death.

159
00:06:07,926 --> 00:06:10,161
What?!
Supermodel!

160
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:14,031
Oh, those poor,
doomed bastards.

161
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:16,934
I guess it's up to me
to complete the mission.

162
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,238
(wind howling)

163
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:25,309
I'll be in the swamp, blowing
the smirk off a toxic yeti.

164
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:28,579
(cocks gun)

165
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:30,147
(shuddering)

166
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,586
Professor, we need
to talk, man-to-mob.

167
00:06:35,654 --> 00:06:37,788
(all clamoring)

168
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,223
We've had it
with Zoidberg!

169
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,025
We demand you fire him!

170
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:42,193
Nonsense.

171
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,128
Zoidberg's a fine physician,

172
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,362
for aliens.

173
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,565
Your mistake is being humans.

174
00:06:47,632 --> 00:06:49,834
No, if I'm going to fire anyone,

175
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:51,335
it'll be Scruffy.

176
00:06:51,403 --> 00:06:53,037
(all shouting)
You can't do that!

177
00:06:53,105 --> 00:06:54,705
Over my dead body!

178
00:06:54,773 --> 00:06:56,073
Don't you get
it, old man?

179
00:06:56,141 --> 00:06:57,942
Thanks to Dr. Scissorhands,

180
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:00,077
I wet myself every
time I laugh.

181
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:01,512
(laughing)

182
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,947
It's not funny!

183
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:04,815
Well, I guess
it is kind of funny.

184
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,317
(laughing)
Uh-oh.

185
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,586
Why are you protecting
Zoidberg, Professor?

186
00:07:08,653 --> 00:07:09,920
Do you owe him
something?

187
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:11,889
Is he blackmailing you
somehow?

188
00:07:11,957 --> 00:07:13,424
What does he
have on you?

189
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:15,659
Why have you kept him
around all these years

190
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,695
when he's so grossly
incompetent?

191
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:18,963
(sighs)

192
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,032
Long ago,
Zoidberg and I

193
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,268
entered
into a secret arrangement

194
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:26,670
relating to certain
extraordinary events

195
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,173
too horrible to reveal.

196
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,243
So there's nothing
to be curious about.

197
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:43,888
(rustling)

198
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:47,224
Stop, or I'll shoot!

199
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:49,660
Zoidberg?

200
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:51,662
You can't hunt a yeti
by yourself, sir.

201
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,897
It's suicidal!

202
00:07:52,964 --> 00:07:54,865
So what? I'm going to die

203
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,600
of hypermalaria, anyway.

204
00:07:56,668 --> 00:07:59,703
I was in the same swamp
as the rest of the men.

205
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,038
Just because you
were in the swamp

206
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,306
doesn't
necessarily mean...

207
00:08:02,374 --> 00:08:04,074
I was thirsty
from the flight.

208
00:08:04,142 --> 00:08:05,976
I drank swamp water.

209
00:08:06,044 --> 00:08:09,513
Look, Zoidberg,
you're a loyal friend.

210
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:10,714
"Friend"?

211
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,149
But I'm doomed.

212
00:08:12,217 --> 00:08:15,386
I might as well capture
a yeti and die trying.

213
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:20,658
Then you'll need someone
to dissect it, friend.

214
00:08:20,725 --> 00:08:22,560
(roaring)

215
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,961
(gun whirring)

216
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:26,096
Go, Johnny! Go!
That's an order!

217
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:29,333
Never! Zoidberg doesn't
abandon a friend, apparently.

218
00:08:35,006 --> 00:08:36,707
Oh. Oh-oh-oh...

219
00:08:36,775 --> 00:08:38,308
(snarling)

220
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:40,277
I'll save us
by scaring him off

221
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:42,045
with my crazy war noise.

222
00:08:42,113 --> 00:08:43,313
(makes gurgling noise)

223
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:44,848
(growls)
(screams)

224
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:48,018
(cracking)

225
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:50,187
Crunch all you want.
I'll make more.

226
00:08:53,892 --> 00:08:55,959
Oy, I lost another one.

227
00:08:56,027 --> 00:08:57,594
(door opens)

228
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,130
Zoidberg, I'm sorry
to break it to you this way,

229
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:02,766
but we hate you and we never
want to see you again.

230
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,101
But friends...

231
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,669
We're not your friends!

232
00:09:05,737 --> 00:09:06,870
We're your victims!

233
00:09:06,938 --> 00:09:08,205
I was just trying to...

234
00:09:08,273 --> 00:09:10,107
Shut up and give
me my kidney back!

235
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,843
(sniffles)
I'm sorry.

236
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:15,345
I'm sorry.
(sobbing)

237
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:17,815
We don't know why the Professor
keeps you around here,

238
00:09:17,882 --> 00:09:20,184
and we don't care.
You're a terrible doctor!

239
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:22,052
Nobody wants
to see you ever again!

240
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,520
Dr. Zoidberg!

241
00:09:23,555 --> 00:09:25,255
I want to see
you right now!

242
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:33,263
The time has
come, my friend.

243
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:36,700
We have to talk about
our arrangement.

244
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:38,836
Oh, no. No, no.

245
00:09:38,903 --> 00:09:40,170
Oh, no, no, no!

246
00:09:40,238 --> 00:09:41,305
Oh, no!

247
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,106
Oh, no!

248
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:44,975
(yeti growling)

249
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,678
Unpaw him, you big ape!

250
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:50,080
I saw this in a Tarzan movie!

251
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:51,715
It was called...
(grunts)

252
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:53,851
<i>Tarzan Versus the Yetis.</i>

253
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:56,053
(grunts)
I lost my virginity

254
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,321
(grunts)... during the film,

255
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,789
so I'm (grunts)...

256
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:00,491
a little fuzzy on the details.

257
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,226
(yeti growling,
Professor grunts)

258
00:10:06,965 --> 00:10:09,132
(Professor shouting)

259
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,835
(Professor and yeti grunt)

260
00:10:15,205 --> 00:10:16,840
John, are you
all right?

261
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:20,010
You... you saved my life!

262
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,879
- Oh, fuff.
- Yes, fuff.

263
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:23,847
How can I ever
repay you?

264
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,015
Do you need a slave?

265
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,116
Or maybe a butler?

266
00:10:26,184 --> 00:10:28,051
No, I haven't needed a butler

267
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,319
since grad school.

268
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:31,188
But I do need a doctor.

269
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,391
I don't want to die
like those Marines, John.

270
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,860
The fever, the madness.

271
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,229
Don't forget the spasms,
coma and death.

272
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:41,798
Oh, I don't want
to go through that.

273
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:43,767
I want you to kill me.

274
00:10:43,835 --> 00:10:45,102
All right. Give
me the knife.

275
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:46,803
Not now!

276
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:49,172
Hypermalaria
can lie dormant for years.

277
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,974
Isn't that what you said?

278
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:53,043
It sounds like something
I would say.

279
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,779
So stay with me until
the symptoms start,

280
00:10:55,847 --> 00:10:58,348
then put me
out of my misery.

281
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,816
You must swear!

282
00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:05,222
All right, Hubert, I swear.

283
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:09,960
It's started, Zoidberg--

284
00:11:10,328 --> 00:11:12,763
the fever, the muscle spasms.

285
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,398
I'm dying.

286
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,600
(coughs)

287
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:19,200
It's time for you to keep your
promise and kill me.

288
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,906
This is very difficult,
but I'll try,

289
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:24,841
friend.

290
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:26,076
(shrieks)

291
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,778
(choking)

292
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:33,620
No, wait,
I'm afraid to die.

293
00:11:33,688 --> 00:11:35,856
Ugh, you said you wanted me
to kill you.

294
00:11:35,923 --> 00:11:38,592
Is this one of those
"no means yes" deals?

295
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:40,527
Yes and no.

296
00:11:40,595 --> 00:11:42,996
I do want you to kill me,
but I mustn't see it coming.

297
00:11:43,064 --> 00:11:44,698
That would be agony.

298
00:11:44,765 --> 00:11:48,201
So you must murder me
completely by surprise.

299
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:51,638
As God is my witness,
you can count on me.

300
00:11:51,706 --> 00:11:54,374
Well, see you tomorrow.

301
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:01,681
Not surprising enough.

302
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:06,786
♪ ♪

303
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,692
(shots firing)

304
00:12:24,972 --> 00:12:26,139
Wha...?
Oh...

305
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:27,908
(screams)
My...

306
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:29,809
heart.

307
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:32,379
(gags)

308
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:48,662
Hey. What are you doing there?

309
00:12:48,729 --> 00:12:52,632
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

310
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,034
Stop, you don't understand.

311
00:12:54,101 --> 00:12:55,535
Let's go,
you murderer.

312
00:12:55,603 --> 00:12:57,103
Fry, help me lock him up.

313
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:59,706
Hang on, I'm learning
how to do loop-de-loops.

314
00:12:59,774 --> 00:13:02,442
Whoa, whoa, whoo!

315
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,511
You're making a mistake.

316
00:13:04,578 --> 00:13:07,547
I was only trying
to kill the Professor.

317
00:13:08,816 --> 00:13:11,751
(straining)

318
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:14,220
(snipping)

319
00:13:15,756 --> 00:13:18,458
Hubert, I'm sorry.

320
00:13:18,526 --> 00:13:20,760
Huh?

321
00:13:20,828 --> 00:13:22,095
He doesn't have hair.

322
00:13:23,163 --> 00:13:25,465
Great Little Caesar's ghost.

323
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:30,003
You fools, you stupid,
life-prolonging fools.

324
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:32,772
I asked Zoidberg to kill me.

325
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,040
Huh? What?
What you talkin' 'bout, Professor?

326
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:35,709
Professor, have you gone mad?

327
00:13:35,776 --> 00:13:37,444
Probably.

328
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:38,945
It's one of the symptoms
of Tritonian hypermalaria.

329
00:13:39,013 --> 00:13:40,880
(gasps)

330
00:13:40,948 --> 00:13:44,784
You mean the incurable disease
that causes fever, spasms,

331
00:13:44,852 --> 00:13:46,786
insanity...
(crazed giggle)

332
00:13:46,854 --> 00:13:48,021
...coma...
(sighs)

333
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:50,957
...and finally death?

334
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:55,428
Yes, and I begged Zoidberg
to put me out of my misery.

335
00:13:55,496 --> 00:13:57,597
Bring him... quickly.

336
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:02,936
(sighs)
Should have known better

337
00:14:03,004 --> 00:14:05,672
than to store my antiques
in the office.

338
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,474
LEELA:
Zoidberg, we were wrong.

339
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:10,944
We're letting you out
so you can kill the Professor.

340
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,913
(whooping)

341
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:16,850
Oh, no, he sand-crabbed out.

342
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:18,952
(sighs)
Then we have no choice.

343
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,688
We'll have to mercy-kill
the Professor ourselves.

344
00:14:21,756 --> 00:14:23,623
Well, let's get started.

345
00:14:29,096 --> 00:14:30,597
We have a situation,
Mother.

346
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:33,533
This creature tried to
sand-crab into the building.

347
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:35,602
Zoidberg?

348
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:37,804
Sorry I didn't call first,
Carol, but I'm in a hurry.

349
00:14:37,872 --> 00:14:39,572
I need your help to save Hubert.

350
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,941
Let him go and stooge
the hell out of here.

351
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:43,543
We're on it.

352
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:44,644
Ow. Ow! Ow!

353
00:14:44,712 --> 00:14:46,413
Beautiful kids.

354
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,448
You must be very proud.

355
00:14:48,516 --> 00:14:50,350
John Zoidberg.

356
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:51,651
It's been a long time.

357
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:52,852
How have you been?

358
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,621
Not too bad.

359
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:56,723
Last year I took a bus trip
to the Grand Canyon.

360
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,525
Later I'll show you
the pictures.

361
00:14:58,592 --> 00:14:59,893
Do you ever regret it, John,

362
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,062
leaving me to work
for the Professor?

363
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:04,831
(sighs) What do you
want me to say?

364
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:06,533
He saved my life.

365
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,901
Oh, big deal.

366
00:15:07,968 --> 00:15:09,702
You could have been rich
if you'd stayed.

367
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,238
Your own lab,
a full staff.

368
00:15:12,306 --> 00:15:14,374
But Hubert is my friend.

369
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:15,809
He's very sick.

370
00:15:15,876 --> 00:15:18,778
I can cure him, but
I need the thing,

371
00:15:18,846 --> 00:15:20,880
the thing from Triton.

372
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:22,749
It'll cost you, John.

373
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:24,350
How much are you worth now?

374
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:25,819
I live in a Dumpster.

375
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:27,821
All I have in the world
is this coupon

376
00:15:27,888 --> 00:15:30,790
for one free session
at the tanning salon.

377
00:15:30,858 --> 00:15:34,427
Oh, John, that's really
all you have?

378
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,332
Then I'll take it.

379
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,202
(groaning deliriously)

380
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,608
Okay, Murdolator's finished.

381
00:15:51,846 --> 00:15:55,715
I said I'd kill him myself,
but nobody listens to Bender.

382
00:15:55,783 --> 00:15:57,650
We all have to share
in the guilt,

383
00:15:57,718 --> 00:16:00,386
which is why we're each going
to add one drop of cyanide

384
00:16:00,454 --> 00:16:02,388
to the death wheel
as it goes by.

385
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:14,868
Commence mercy-killing

386
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:18,138
in three, two, a-yup.

387
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,209
Kill-check one is go.

388
00:16:33,521 --> 00:16:34,621
(all gasp)

389
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,224
(all cheer)

390
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:40,727
Kill-check two is go.

391
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,510
(Oohing and Aahing)

392
00:16:57,578 --> 00:16:59,612
It's about time.

393
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:09,322
Vegetables activated.

394
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:19,632
Kill-check three is go.

395
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,367
Also, the salad's ready.

396
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:22,835
(all cheering)

397
00:17:23,603 --> 00:17:24,671
ZOIDBERG:
What the hell are you doing?

398
00:17:26,238 --> 00:17:27,373
TEELA:
Zoidberg,

399
00:17:27,374 --> 00:17:28,775
we know about your
secret agreement.

400
00:17:29,342 --> 00:17:32,411
I am so, so sorry for
how we treated you.

401
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:35,414
And to make it up to you, we're
killing the Professor for you

402
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:37,950
so he doesn't die horribly
from hypermalaria.

403
00:17:38,018 --> 00:17:40,953
He doesn't have hypermalaria,
you idiots.

404
00:17:41,021 --> 00:17:42,888
(animal roar)

405
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:45,858
He has yeti-ism.
(all gasp)

406
00:17:45,926 --> 00:17:47,993
When he saved my life
all those years ago,

407
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:49,862
he was scratched by a yeti.

408
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:55,000
Hmm, I consider myself
almost completely ignorant

409
00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:58,070
of modern medicine, and
I've never heard of yeti-ism.

410
00:17:58,138 --> 00:18:01,040
It mimics the symptoms
of hypermalaria exactly,

411
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:03,175
except for the part
where instead of dying,

412
00:18:03,243 --> 00:18:05,111
you turn into a yeti.

413
00:18:05,178 --> 00:18:06,212
Aah.

414
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:13,786
(whistling)
Wow.

415
00:18:13,854 --> 00:18:16,122
Hold him down
while I prepare the antidote.

416
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:20,960
Another yeti?

417
00:18:21,027 --> 00:18:23,129
Yes, the same jerk
that once noshed on me

418
00:18:23,196 --> 00:18:25,097
like a shrimp toast.

419
00:18:25,165 --> 00:18:28,434
Now who's getting
his pineal gland extracted?

420
00:18:28,502 --> 00:18:29,869
(grunts angrily)

421
00:18:29,936 --> 00:18:31,537
Ah, yes,

422
00:18:31,605 --> 00:18:35,441
this contains a concentrated
form of the yeti neurotoxin.

423
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:37,843
But that's what gave him
yeti-ism in the first place.

424
00:18:37,911 --> 00:18:39,779
Won't it just make him
a double-yeti?

425
00:18:39,846 --> 00:18:42,915
Don't lecture me about
alien physiology, Conrad.

426
00:18:42,983 --> 00:18:44,383
The pineal neurotoxin
neutralizes

427
00:18:44,451 --> 00:18:46,252
the adrenal neurotoxin.

428
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,854
That's why yetis
don't drive themselves mad.

429
00:18:48,922 --> 00:18:50,723
(roars furiously)

430
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:57,196
My God, he's like some kind
of believable Hulk.

431
00:18:57,264 --> 00:18:59,698
No time for an injection.

432
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:01,634
(roaring)

433
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,172
(grunts angrily)

434
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:08,073
(gulps)

435
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:13,913
(roars)

436
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,719
ZOIDBERG: I'll be damned,
it did make him a double-yeti.

437
00:19:20,787 --> 00:19:22,888
(roars)
(whistling stops)

438
00:19:26,092 --> 00:19:29,195
(growling)

439
00:19:29,262 --> 00:19:31,263
(groans)

440
00:19:35,268 --> 00:19:37,002
(all screaming)

441
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:53,319
It wasn't supposed to do
any of those things.

442
00:20:02,027 --> 00:20:03,162
You did it, Johnny.

443
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:05,064
I'm cured.

444
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:15,941
All right, let's set
it up and try again.

445
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,215
There's one thing
I don't understand, Zoidberg.

446
00:20:23,283 --> 00:20:27,086
How did you persuade Mom to give
you her precious yeti head?

447
00:20:27,153 --> 00:20:29,455
Did you have to promise
anything in return?

448
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:32,522
Nothing, nothing at all.

449
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:35,022
This calls for a celebration.

450
00:20:35,122 --> 00:20:37,922
Come on, everyone,
Let´s go tanning!

451
00:20:38,122 --> 00:20:39,522
(All cheer)

452
00:20:41,622 --> 00:20:42,322
(Groan)

453
00:20:42,522 --> 00:20:44,422
I was going to tan...

454
00:20:44,922 --> 00:20:45,822
...once

455
00:20:47,222 --> 00:20:49,822
What do you say, Johnny?
It's on me.

456
00:20:51,322 --> 00:20:52,822
Thank you, Hubert.

457
00:20:54,022 --> 00:20:56,822
(whooping)

458
