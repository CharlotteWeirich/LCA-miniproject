<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

10
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:31,250
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:33,456
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,457 --> 00:00:37,189
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,812
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

Chapter Ten: Jet

15
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:18,511
Where's Momo?

16
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:23,317
Hang on Momo!

17
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:38,988
All right... you too.

18
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:42,335
This is gonna take forever.

19
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:46,058
That works...

20
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:52,977
These are Fire Nation traps... you can tell from the metalwork.

21
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:57,117
We'd better pack up camp, and get moving.

22
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,369
Ah-ah... no flying this time.

23
00:01:59,473 --> 00:02:00,153
What?

24
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:01,334
Why wouldn't we fly?

25
00:02:01,426 --> 00:02:04,731
Think about it. Somehow Prince Zuko and the Fire Nation keep finding us.

26
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:07,428
It's because they spot Appa... he's just too noticeable.

27
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,806
What! Appa's not too noticeable!

28
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:15,542
He's a gigantic fluffy monster with an arrow on his head... it's kinda hard to miss him!

29
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:18,114
Sokka's just jealous 'cause he doesn't have an arrow.

30
00:02:18,197 --> 00:02:19,133
I know you all want to fly,...

31
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:22,376
...but my instincts tell me we should play it safe this time and walk.

32
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,096
Who made you the boss?

33
00:02:24,163 --> 00:02:25,933
I'm not the boss... I'm the leader.

34
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:30,261
You're the leader? But your voice still cracks!

35
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:33,994
I'm the oldest and I'm a warrior. So... I'm the leader!

36
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:37,996
If anyone's the leader, it's Aang. I mean, he is the Avatar.

37
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,892
Are you kidding... he's just a goofy kid!

38
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:42,742
He's right.

39
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:45,709
Why do boys always think someone has to be the leader?

40
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:48,377
I bet you wouldn't be so bossy if you kissed a girl.

41
00:02:48,463 --> 00:02:51,005
I-I've kissed a girl... you... just haven't met her.

42
00:02:51,078 --> 00:02:54,660
Who? Gran-gran? I've met Gran-gran.

43
00:02:54,738 --> 00:02:56,437
No... besides Gran-gran.

44
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:59,787
Look, my instincts tell me we have a better chance of slipping through on foot...

45
00:02:59,838 --> 00:03:02,029
...and a leader has to trust his instincts.

46
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:05,622
Okay, we'll try it your way Oh Wise Leader.

47
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:08,739
Who knows... walking might be fun.

48
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:12,804
Walking stinks! How do people go anywhere without a flying bison?

49
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:14,080
I don't know Aang.

50
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:18,032
Why don't you ask Sokka's instincts... they seem to know everything.

51
00:03:18,113 --> 00:03:19,404
Haha. Very funny.

52
00:03:19,504 --> 00:03:21,539
I'm tired of carrying this pack.

53
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:25,718
You know who you should ask to carry it for a while? Sokka's Instincts!

54
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:29,539
That's a great idea! Hey, Sokka's Instincts, would you mind...

55
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:31,030
Okay, okay... I get it.

56
00:03:31,137 --> 00:03:32,794
Look guys, I'm tired too.

57
00:03:32,886 --> 00:03:38,258
But the important thing is that we're safe from... the... Fire... Nation...

58
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:43,006
Run!

59
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,693
We're cut off!

60
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,416
Sokka, your shirt!

61
00:03:58,013 --> 00:04:00,936
If you let us pass, we promise not to hurt you.

62
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:02,665
What are you doing?

63
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,107
Bluffing?

64
00:04:04,205 --> 00:04:09,042
You? Promise not to hurt us?

65
00:04:09,495 --> 00:04:11,871
Nice work, Sokka! How'd ya do that?

66
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:14,174
Uh... instinct?

67
00:04:14,247 --> 00:04:16,461
Look!

68
00:04:27,427 --> 00:04:29,497
Down you go.

69
00:04:34,293 --> 00:04:36,959
They're in the trees!

70
00:04:55,553 --> 00:04:57,116
Hey, he was mine!

71
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,535
Gotta be quicker next time.

72
00:05:19,748 --> 00:05:21,428
Man!

73
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,612
Hey.

74
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,469
Hi.

75
00:05:35,872 --> 00:05:38,815
You just took out a whole army almost single-handed!

76
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:43,213
Army? Pfft. There were only, like, twenty guys!

77
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:45,875
My name is Jet, and these are my Freedom Fighters.

78
00:05:45,957 --> 00:05:51,880
Sneers... Longshot... Smellerbee... The Duke and Pipsqueak.

79
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:56,046
Pipsqueak... that's a funny name.

80
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:59,379
You think my name is funny?

81
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,472
It's hilarious.

82
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:21,276
Um... thanks for saving us Jet. We were lucky you were there.

83
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:25,429
I should be thanking you. We were waiting to ambush those soldiers all morning...

84
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:28,738
...we just needed the right distraction. And then you guys stumbled in.

85
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:30,831
We were relying on instincts.

86
00:06:30,901 --> 00:06:34,823
You'll get yourself killed doing that.

87
00:06:37,568 --> 00:06:40,635
Hey Jet... these barrels are filled with blasting jelly.

88
00:06:40,715 --> 00:06:42,354
That's a great score.

89
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,282
And these boxes are filled with jelly candy!

90
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:48,356
Also good. Let's not get those mixed up.

91
00:06:48,427 --> 00:06:50,383
We'll take the stuff back to the hideout.

92
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:52,004
You guys have a hideout?

93
00:06:52,086 --> 00:06:52,708
You wanna see it?

94
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:55,486
Yes we wanna see it!

95
00:06:58,705 --> 00:06:59,660
We're here.

96
00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:01,349
Where... there's nothing here?!

97
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,378
Hold this.

98
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:05,072
Why... what's this do?

99
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:06,859
Aang?

100
00:07:06,963 --> 00:07:09,614
I'll get up on my own.

101
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:15,276
Grab hold of me Katara.

102
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:30,310
Nice place you got!

103
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,133
It's beautiful up here!

104
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,796
It's beautiful... and more importantly the Fire Nation can't find us.

105
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,687
They would love to find you. Wouldn't they, Jet?

106
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:45,796
It's not gonna happen, Smellerbee.

107
00:07:45,876 --> 00:07:47,861
Why does the Fire Nation want to find you?

108
00:07:47,938 --> 00:07:50,559
I guess you could say I've been causing them a little trouble.

109
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,075
See, they took over a nearby Earth Kingdom town a few years back.

110
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:57,163
We've been ambushin' their troops, cutting off their supply lines,...

111
00:07:57,233 --> 00:07:59,947
...and doing anything we can to mess with 'em.

112
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:03,956
One day, we'll drive the Fire Nation out of here for good and free that town.

113
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:05,735
That's so brave.

114
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:08,578
Yeah, nothing's braver than a guy in a treehouse.

115
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:10,627
Don't pay any attention to my brother.

116
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,146
No problem. He probably had a rough day.

117
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:14,896
So, you all live here?

118
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:17,235
That's right. Longshot over there?

119
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:19,606
His town got burned down by the fire Nation.

120
00:08:19,693 --> 00:08:24,361
And we found the Duke trying to steal our food. I don't think he ever really had a home.

121
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,812
What about you?

122
00:08:27,445 --> 00:08:29,960
Fire Nation killed my parents.

123
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:34,059
I was only eight years old. That day changed me forever.

124
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:37,283
Sokka and I lost our mother to the Fire Nation.

125
00:08:37,364 --> 00:08:40,711
I'm so sorry, Katara.

126
00:08:49,472 --> 00:08:55,616
Today, we struck another blow against the Fire Nation swine.

127
00:08:56,884 --> 00:09:00,079
I got a special joy from the look on one soldier's face,...

128
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:06,051
...when the Duke dropped down on his helmet and rode him like a wild hog monkey.

129
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,792
Now, the Fire Nation thinks they don't have to worry about a couple of kids...

130
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:18,224
...hiding in the trees. Maybe they're right.

131
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:24,952
Or maybe... they are dead wrong!

132
00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:30,622
Hey Jet, nice speech.

133
00:09:30,724 --> 00:09:34,284
Thanks. By the way, I was really impressed with you and Aang.

134
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:36,532
That was some great bending I saw out there today.

135
00:09:36,614 --> 00:09:41,326
Well, he's great. He's the Avatar. I could use some more training.

136
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:44,658
Avatar huh? Very nice.

137
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:46,109
Thanks Jet.

138
00:09:46,206 --> 00:09:48,772
So I might know a way that you and Aang can help in our struggle.

139
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:51,599
Unfortunately we have to leave tonight.

140
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:56,470
Sokka, you're kidding me! I needed you on an important mission tomorrow.

141
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:58,417
What mission?

142
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,613
What are you doing?

143
00:10:12,676 --> 00:10:15,431
Shh~ it amplifies vibrations.

144
00:10:15,523 --> 00:10:16,766
Good trick.

145
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:20,910
Nothing yet. Wait! Yes, someone's approaching.

146
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:21,892
How many?

147
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:24,797
I think there's just one.

148
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:28,216
Good work, Sokka. Ready your weapon.

149
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:35,872
Wait! False alarm... he's just an old man.

150
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:42,077
What are you doing in our woods, you leech?

151
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:46,115
Please sir, I'm just a traveler.

152
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:59,228
Do you like destroying towns? Do you like destroying families? Do you?!

153
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,159
Oh... please let me go... have mercy...

154
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:08,509
Does the Fire Nation let people go?! Does the Fire Nation have mercy?!

155
00:11:08,573 --> 00:11:10,504
Jet, he's just an old man!

156
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,374
He's Fire Nation! Search him!

157
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:14,010
But he's not hurting anyone!

158
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:18,423
Have you forgotten that the Fire Nation killed your mother? Remember why you fight!

159
00:11:18,507 --> 00:11:20,141
We've got his stuff, Jet.

160
00:11:20,225 --> 00:11:21,897
This doesn't feel right.

161
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:25,669
It's what has to be done... now let's get outta here.

162
00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:31,377
Come on Sokka!

163
00:11:35,297 --> 00:11:39,309
Sokka! Look what the Duke gave me!

164
00:11:44,692 --> 00:11:46,774
Ow! Quit it!

165
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:48,897
Hey Sokka. Is Jet back?

166
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:51,078
Yeah... he's back. But we're leaving.

167
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:51,953
What?

168
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:54,452
But I made him this hat.

169
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:56,424
Your boyfriend Jet's a thug.

170
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,790
What? No, he's not.

171
00:11:58,881 --> 00:12:00,380
He's messed up Katara.

172
00:12:00,468 --> 00:12:04,952
He's not messed up, he's just got a different way of life... a really fun way of life.

173
00:12:05,036 --> 00:12:08,209
He beat and robbed a harmless old man!

174
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:11,328
I wanna hear Jet's side of the story.

175
00:12:11,424 --> 00:12:12,126
Sokka...

176
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:15,547
...you told them what happened but you didn't mention that the guy was Fire Nation?

177
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,404
No, he conveniently left that part out.

178
00:12:18,495 --> 00:12:22,019
Fine! But even if he was Fire Nation, he was a harmless civilian.

179
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:24,956
He was an assassin, Sokka.

180
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:29,147
See? There's a compartment for poison in the knife.

181
00:12:29,237 --> 00:12:32,842
He was sent to eliminate me... you helped save my life, Sokka.

182
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,988
I knew there was an explanation.

183
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:36,645
I didn't see any knife!

184
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:38,652
That's because he was concealing it.

185
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:42,283
See Sokka? I'm sure you just didn't notice the knife.

186
00:12:42,352 --> 00:12:47,670
There was no knife! I'm going back to the hut and packing my things.

187
00:12:47,755 --> 00:12:50,743
Tell me you guys aren't leaving yet. I really need your help.

188
00:12:50,827 --> 00:12:51,908
What can we do?

189
00:12:51,993 --> 00:12:54,555
The Fire Nation is planning on burning down our forest.

190
00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:58,349
If you both use water bending to fill the reservoir, we could fight the fires.

191
00:12:58,426 --> 00:13:03,636
But if you leave now, they'll destroy the whole valley.

192
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:09,268
We can't leave now with the Fire Nation about to burn down a forest!

193
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:12,996
I'm sorry Katara. Jet's very smooth, but we can't trust him.

194
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:17,624
You know what I think? You're jealous that he's a better warrior and a better leader!

195
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,891
Katara, I'm not jealous of Jet. It's just that my instinct...

196
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,419
Well my instincts tell me we need to stay here a little longer and help Jet.

197
00:13:25,494 --> 00:13:26,885
Come on Aang.

198
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,413
Sorry Sokka.

199
00:13:38,223 --> 00:13:40,313
Let's go.

200
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:05,351
Now listen... you are not to blow the dam until I give the signal.

201
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:09,395
If the reservoir isn't full, the Fire Nation troops could survive.

202
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:13,635
But what about the people in the town... won't they get wiped out too?

203
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:17,300
Look Duke, that's the price of ridding this area of the Fire Nation.

204
00:14:17,365 --> 00:14:22,548
Now don't blow the dam until I give the signal... got it?

205
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:28,676
Where do you think you're going, ponytail?

206
00:14:31,874 --> 00:14:36,096
Sokka. I'm glad you decided to join us.

207
00:14:36,185 --> 00:14:38,706
I heard your plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom town.

208
00:14:38,798 --> 00:14:41,435
Our plan is to rid the valley of the Fire Nation.

209
00:14:41,518 --> 00:14:44,974
There are people living there Jet... mothers and fathers and children.

210
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:47,818
We can't win without making some sacrifices.

211
00:14:47,911 --> 00:14:50,380
You lied to Aang and Katara about the forest fire!

212
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,215
Because they don't understand the demands of war. Not like you and I do.

213
00:14:54,306 --> 00:14:59,069
I do understand. I understand that there's nothing you won't do to get what you want.

214
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:05,214
I was hoping you'd have an open mind, but I can see you've made your choice.

215
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:10,025
I can't let you warn Katara and Aang. Take him for a walk... a long walk.

216
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,802
You can't do this!

217
00:15:11,905 --> 00:15:18,943
Cheer up, Sokka. We're gonna win a great victory against the Fire Nation today.

218
00:15:19,303 --> 00:15:21,995
Jet... I'm sorry about how Sokka's been acting.

219
00:15:22,094 --> 00:15:24,640
No worries... he already apologized.

220
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:27,381
Really? Sokka apologized?

221
00:15:27,474 --> 00:15:31,987
Yeah... I was surprised too. I got the sense that maybe you talked to him or something.

222
00:15:32,082 --> 00:15:33,174
Yeah, I did.

223
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,102
I guess something you said got through to him.

224
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:38,726
Anyhow, he went out on a scouting mission with Pipsqueak and Smellerbee.

225
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:43,778
I'm glad he cooled off. He's so stubborn sometimes.

226
00:15:44,114 --> 00:15:48,206
All right, we're here. Underground water's trying to escape through these vents.

227
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,068
I need you guys to help it along.

228
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:54,609
I've never used bending on water I can't see. I don't know.

229
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:57,261
Katara. You can do this.

230
00:15:57,346 --> 00:15:58,769
What about me?

231
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,715
I know the Avatar can do this.

232
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,962
Yes! Good job!

233
00:16:24,062 --> 00:16:28,044
This river empties into the reservoir... a few more geysers and it'll be full.

234
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:31,298
Look, there's another steam vent.

235
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:36,281
Okay. You two keep it up... I'll go check on things at the reservoir.

236
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:38,143
When we're done we'll meet you over there.

237
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:44,730
Actually... probably better if you meet me back at the hideout when you're done.

238
00:16:52,115 --> 00:16:55,473
I bet that's enough... and I'm not just saying that to be lazy.

239
00:16:55,572 --> 00:16:57,522
Let's catch up with Jet at the reservoir.

240
00:16:57,614 --> 00:16:59,894
I thought we agreed to meet Jet back at the hideout.

241
00:16:59,973 --> 00:17:05,739
Well, we finished early... I'm sure he'll be happy to see us.

242
00:17:06,174 --> 00:17:08,303
Come on... move along!

243
00:17:08,405 --> 00:17:12,020
How can you stand by and do nothing while Jet wipes out a whole town?

244
00:17:12,102 --> 00:17:14,694
Hey listen Sokka, Jet's a great leader.

245
00:17:14,796 --> 00:17:20,752
We follow what he says, and things always turn out okay.

246
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,311
If that's how Jet leads, then he's got a lot to learn.

247
00:17:26,392 --> 00:17:27,748
Hey!

248
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:35,824
While you two are up there you might want to practice your knot-work.

249
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:42,692
Hey Smellerbee... you gonna eat your leechee nuts?

250
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,699
What are they doing?

251
00:17:48,794 --> 00:17:51,641
Hey, those are the red barrels he got from the Fire Nation.

252
00:17:51,707 --> 00:17:54,308
Why would they need blasting jelly?

253
00:17:54,394 --> 00:17:56,540
Because Jet's gonna blow up the dam.

254
00:17:56,627 --> 00:18:01,207
What? No... that would destroy the town. Jet wouldn't do that.

255
00:18:01,283 --> 00:18:03,139
I've gotta stop him.

256
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:06,927
Jet wouldn't do that.

257
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:08,857
Yes I would.

258
00:18:08,953 --> 00:18:10,181
Jet... why?

259
00:18:10,272 --> 00:18:13,274
Katara, you would too if you just stopped to think.

260
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,056
Think about what the Fire Nation did to your mother...

261
00:18:16,144 --> 00:18:18,828
...we can't let them do that to anyone else, ever again.

262
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,587
This isn't the answer!

263
00:18:20,668 --> 00:18:23,282
I want you to understand me Katara.

264
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,727
I thought your brother would understand, but...

265
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,733
Where's Sokka?

266
00:18:27,835 --> 00:18:30,451
Katara.

267
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,213
I need to get to the dam.

268
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:42,131
You're not going anywhere without your glider.

269
00:18:43,744 --> 00:18:45,389
I'm not gonna fight you, Jet.

270
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:49,163
You'll have to if you want your glider back.

271
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:36,227
Why, Jet? I can't believe I trusted you. You lied to me... you're sick and I trusted you!

272
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,414
What are you doing?

273
00:20:41,511 --> 00:20:42,598
You're too late.

274
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:44,305
No!

275
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,728
Sokka's still out there... he's our only chance.

276
00:20:52,814 --> 00:20:59,264
Come on, Sokka. I'm sorry I ever doubted you. Please.

277
00:21:04,816 --> 00:21:06,981
No...

278
00:21:25,611 --> 00:21:27,304
Sokka didn't make it in time.

279
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:31,373
All those people... Jet... you monster!

280
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,199
This was a victory, Katara. Remember that.

281
00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:37,199
The Fire Nation is gone and this valley will be safe.

282
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:41,079
It will be safe... without you.

283
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,276
Sokka!

284
00:21:42,361 --> 00:21:44,989
I warned the villagers of your plan, just in time.

285
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:45,788
What!

286
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:49,919
At first they didn't believe me. The Fire Nation soldiers assumed I was a spy.

287
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,641
But one man vouched for me... the old man you attacked.

288
00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:59,519
He urged them to trust me, and we got everyone out in time.

289
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,557
Missus Pretty!

290
00:22:04,668 --> 00:22:07,610
Sokka, you fool! We could've freed this valley!

291
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:10,346
Who would be free... everyone would be dead.

292
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:11,480
You traitor!

293
00:22:11,578 --> 00:22:15,711
No, Jet. You became the traitor when you stopped protecting innocent people.

294
00:22:15,795 --> 00:22:18,464
Katara. Please... help me.

295
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:20,794
Goodbye Jet.

296
00:22:20,885 --> 00:22:23,235
Yip yip.

297
00:22:26,642 --> 00:22:30,201
We thought you were going to the dam. How come you went to the town instead?

298
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,962
Lemme guess... your instincts told you.

299
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:34,950
Hey... sometimes they're right.

300
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:38,747
Um... Sokka? You know we're going the wrong way, right?

301
00:22:38,845 --> 00:22:41,580
And sometimes they're wrong.

302
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,014
