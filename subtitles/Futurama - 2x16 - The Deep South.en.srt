1
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:09,403
Deep South

2
00:00:34,973 --> 00:00:39,763
Exciting news! The pet license
I requisitioned for Nibbler is here.

3
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:43,283
That's sweet.
I didn't know you cared about Nibbler.

4
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:47,202
Dream on! I want to put him in a sack,
toss the sack in the river. . .

5
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:48,971
. . .and hurl the river into space.

6
00:00:49,173 --> 00:00:53,849
But I like filling out requisitions.
And these were some doozies!

7
00:00:54,373 --> 00:00:56,887
Great Jah's dreadlocks!
There's been a mix-up.

8
00:00:57,093 --> 00:01:00,642
This isn't the pet license,
it's a fishing license!

9
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:02,446
And it's mandatory!

10
00:01:14,653 --> 00:01:18,043
The exact center
of the Atlantic Ocean!

11
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:21,086
Seems the logical place
for fish to congregate!

12
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:24,251
-We're in international waters?
-Indeed so.

13
00:01:24,773 --> 00:01:29,289
Falcon, this is Blue Raven.
The goose has nested.

14
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:35,763
Guess what you're accessories to?

15
00:01:36,253 --> 00:01:39,006
The sun, the sea air, good friends.

16
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:42,444
Leela's right. Fishing blows.
Let's make it interesting.

17
00:01:42,653 --> 00:01:44,006
-Why not?
-Yeah, cool!

18
00:01:44,213 --> 00:01:46,647
Everybody kick in 5 bucks!

19
00:01:47,813 --> 00:01:50,008
-Wasn't that interesting?
-Bender!

20
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:55,285
This contest is as good as over.
I once caught a fish this big.

21
00:01:55,493 --> 00:01:58,610
Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish
this big.

22
00:01:59,773 --> 00:02:01,889
You're both out of your league!

23
00:02:02,093 --> 00:02:05,324
Because you're looking at a woman
who owns a harpoon.

24
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:07,529
Harpoon my ass!

25
00:02:07,773 --> 00:02:09,001
Okay!

26
00:02:11,213 --> 00:02:13,647
Let's see now. Which bait to use?

27
00:02:13,893 --> 00:02:16,168
Crickets? Squid? Chicken necks?

28
00:02:16,413 --> 00:02:18,688
Excuse me, if I might be so bold.

29
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:22,761
I am willing to offer my services
as a bait critic.

30
00:02:22,973 --> 00:02:27,251
These sardines, for example,
are bland and tasteless.

31
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:32,844
And these dry, stringy
night crawlers, though juicy. . . .

32
00:02:33,093 --> 00:02:35,448
Very, very juicy.

33
00:02:38,453 --> 00:02:41,092
I don't believe this!
It's eating my bait!

34
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,642
Beat it, you mooching crawdad!

35
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,330
Hey, Fry.
Check out my laser-guided fishing rod.

36
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:53,529
Quiet, you'll scare away the fish.

37
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:56,042
Fine. I'll head to the other side.

38
00:02:56,373 --> 00:02:58,807
Good luck fishing on this side!

39
00:03:02,613 --> 00:03:05,286
I can hit a fish
between the eyes from 20 yards.

40
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,922
-Yeah? I can hit a shrimp!
-A shrimp?

41
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:10,209
I find it a bit hard to believe that--

42
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:17,331
Gather around, chumps!
I got the winner.

43
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:23,531
So, this is where you
shop for your boots!

44
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:28,852
A couple more of those and you'll have
yourself a fish stick.

45
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:32,563
A fish this fine belongs
in a fish nugget-style chunklet.

46
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:36,044
It's bigger than anything
you've caught.

47
00:03:38,773 --> 00:03:40,923
My small intestine.

48
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:43,726
Bingo!

49
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,965
Whatever it is, it's 20 times
heavier than a boot.

50
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:53,563
You'll never catch anything with
that primitive technology.

51
00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:56,202
What you need is this fish pheromone.

52
00:03:56,413 --> 00:04:00,042
The most potent aphrodisiac
known to fishkind.

53
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:10,211
I am so into you!

54
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:14,169
Oh, my!

55
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:18,452
Bender, I just caught a fish this big!

56
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:20,405
Quit exaggerating!

57
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,611
Screw this!

58
00:04:22,813 --> 00:04:27,204
If I'm not gonna catch a fish,
I might as well not catch a big fish.

59
00:04:28,293 --> 00:04:32,366
There. Like most problems,
this one can be solved with bending.

60
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:36,007
Bender, be careful!

61
00:04:36,213 --> 00:04:39,649
That's the ship's diamond
filament tether. It's unbreakable.

62
00:04:39,853 --> 00:04:44,085
-Then, why do I have to be careful?
-It belonged to my grandmother.

63
00:04:47,613 --> 00:04:49,092
My Manwich!

64
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:06,322
Wake up! I've got something.
And this time, it's alive!

65
00:05:09,573 --> 00:05:13,168
Dr. Zoidberg, since when
do you even wear boots?

66
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,450
I wasn't wearing it. I was eating it!

67
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:20,326
Come on, let's go home.

68
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:25,488
Sunburn! My fabulous body!
It's ruined!

69
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:27,451
What happened to my parasol?

70
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:30,008
It wasn't here
when I took your umbrella.

71
00:05:31,453 --> 00:05:34,490
-I put sun block on you.
-It didn't work.

72
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:41,087
Come on, Bender.
Pull in your line and let's go.

73
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:46,565
Hey! I'm snagged!

74
00:05:47,653 --> 00:05:51,885
It's not snagged. The mechano-man has
caught something!

75
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:59,044
Sweet zombie Jesus! It's huge!

76
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:00,482
It's coming up!

77
00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:10,969
-That's big!
-A colossal mouth bass!

78
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,126
It's diving!

79
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:19,208
It's pulling us under! lnto the ship!

80
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,892
Wait, I'll save us. . .

81
00:06:21,093 --> 00:06:24,005
. . .by cutting the unbreakable diamond
filament.

82
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:29,128
Well, at least I'll die
with my friends. Hello?

83
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:40,046
My Speedos!

84
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,930
Depth at 4500 feet!

85
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:50,322
Forty-eight hundred!

86
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:51,688
Fifty hundred!

87
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:53,127
Five thousand feet!

88
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:57,082
Dear Lord! That's over
1 50 atmospheres of pressure!

89
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,244
How many atmospheres
can the ship withstand?

90
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:03,332
It's a spaceship, so I'd say
anywhere between zero and one.

91
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,052
What's that?
ls someone bending girders?

92
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:17,004
We'll be crushed if we don't equalize.

93
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:18,248
How do we do that?

94
00:07:19,653 --> 00:07:20,768
That should do it.

95
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:22,327
We're gonna die!

96
00:07:22,573 --> 00:07:24,643
Wait! I'll be back in a minute.

97
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:36,650
-You did it, Fry!
-Did what?

98
00:07:43,373 --> 00:07:47,286
People, it's far, far worse
than we thought.

99
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:49,326
My fish got away!

100
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:54,767
Good as new!

101
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:59,643
Except we're 3 miles down below,
have no food, and the ship won't work.

102
00:07:59,853 --> 00:08:04,324
Tempers are wearing thin. Let's hope
some robot doesn't kill everybody!

103
00:08:04,573 --> 00:08:07,849
Don't panic. There are rules
for situations like this.

104
00:08:09,453 --> 00:08:11,887
The first order of business is lunch.

105
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:15,847
I suggest a nice lobster Zoidberg.
I mean lobster Newburg.

106
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:17,691
I mean Dr. Zoidberg.

107
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,730
Okay, everyone calm down.

108
00:08:19,973 --> 00:08:21,850
The professor and I
will work on the ship.

109
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:24,965
Bender, Zoidberg: Since you can
survive under water. . .

110
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,532
. . .you'll go out and find food.

111
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,684
I better go too.
They don't know what I like.

112
00:08:28,893 --> 00:08:32,727
No! The pressure will crush you like
a snake under a sugarcane truck!

113
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:34,042
Not necessarily.

114
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:38,724
This is a chance for Fry to test
my experimental anti-pressure pill.

115
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,652
I can't swallow that!

116
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:44,169
Well, then, good news!
It's a suppository.

117
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,971
How are you doing there?

118
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:55,125
Glad to hear it!

119
00:09:01,853 --> 00:09:03,206
Ah, yeah.

120
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:06,850
Yum, yum, yum.

121
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:19,683
Look at me! I'm Dr. Zoidberg,
homeowner!

122
00:09:24,373 --> 00:09:27,649
Careful, Fry. I think that flag
may be poisonous.

123
00:09:27,853 --> 00:09:30,925
Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us
some hearty grub!

124
00:09:36,893 --> 00:09:39,691
The laws of science
be a harsh mistress.

125
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:43,164
Robot, old buddy,
could you help me move a couch?

126
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:46,647
Okay. But I'm not
carrying it upstairs.

127
00:09:59,453 --> 00:10:00,966
What is it, Fry?

128
00:10:02,373 --> 00:10:04,568
You want lemonade?
You saw a parade?

129
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,724
Your student loans have been repaid?

130
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:11,609
Then how about lending your old pal
Zoidberg a few bucks, Mr. Millionaire.

131
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:19,411
Fry, swallow your food, then talk.

132
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:21,607
A mermaid!

133
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:24,010
You think you saw a mermaid?

134
00:10:24,213 --> 00:10:26,773
No, I did see a mermaid.
She was wearing a tube top. . .

135
00:10:27,013 --> 00:10:30,210
. . .and she had a scaly tail,
and hair extensions.

136
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:32,244
-Yeah, right!
-Sure she did!

137
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:35,570
You are simply hallucinating,
you moron!

138
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:37,445
What's so far-fetched about mermaids?

139
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:40,804
There's all sorts of weird
sea creatures here in the future.

140
00:10:41,013 --> 00:10:42,492
Like Dr. Zoidberg!

141
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:47,408
Fry is suffering from ocean madness.

142
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,764
Every time something good happens
to me, you say it's madness.

143
00:10:51,013 --> 00:10:53,243
Or I'm drunk. Or I ate too much candy.

144
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:55,251
Well, I saw a real mermaid!

145
00:10:55,493 --> 00:10:58,724
And I wish for once my friends had
the decency to believe me!

146
00:10:58,973 --> 00:11:00,770
Ocean madness.

147
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:06,811
He may have ocean madness, but that's
no excuse for ocean rudeness.

148
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:17,691
Ocean madness. Yeah, right!
It's always something, ain't it?

149
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:22,086
It's her! Bender, wake up!
She's here, wake up!

150
00:11:28,093 --> 00:11:28,923
Oxygen!

151
00:11:37,853 --> 00:11:39,491
Here you go, darling.

152
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:44,169
Hey! I can breathe and talk,
just like a fish!

153
00:11:44,373 --> 00:11:46,045
You speak fish?

154
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:50,692
-What?
-I'm sorry, my accent's atrocious.

155
00:11:51,053 --> 00:11:53,726
-Hi, my name is Umbriel.
-I'm Fry.

156
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:57,090
-So, am I gonna drown?
-Of course not!

157
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:00,689
Just stay calm and let the gentle
currents relax your every muscle.

158
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:05,132
Did it just get warmer?

159
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,245
I can't believe you're real.
I like your tail.

160
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:12,321
You're sweet! I like those wiggly
doodads coming out of your hips.

161
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,246
Thanks. They're called pants.

162
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,046
This here is a volcanic vent.

163
00:12:17,293 --> 00:12:20,922
-The water is over 4000 degrees.
-No kidding.

164
00:12:22,613 --> 00:12:24,444
Did it just get colder?

165
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:29,483
Tell me more about that bizarre landie
world you come from.

166
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:31,086
Is there water there too?

167
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,052
Sure, sometimes it falls from the sky.

168
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,364
And sometimes it doesn't.

169
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:39,252
Mr. Fry, you do go on!

170
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:42,769
What's best about you is
you find me fascinating.

171
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,851
Even if I'm not claiming to be
a jewel thief or lion-tamer.

172
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:48,653
Lions? There are sea lions
on the land?

173
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:52,129
Yep! We call them land sea lions.
I tame them.

174
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:23,002
I've almost reconfigured
the ship's propulsion system.

175
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:26,251
We can leave as soon
as the papier-mâché is dry.

176
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:28,967
-Where's Fry?
-I didn't kill him. You?

177
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:30,765
No, I've been busy.

178
00:13:31,013 --> 00:13:35,529
He must've gone looking for that
mermaid. Poor demented honky.

179
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:37,451
It's ocean madness, all right.

180
00:13:37,653 --> 00:13:41,202
Sailors call it aqua dementia.
The deep down crazies.

181
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:43,847
The wet willies. The screaming moist.

182
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:47,090
We'll form a search party.
We'll need oxygen.

183
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,051
I got it covered.

184
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:53,247
In the event of emergency, my ass
can be used as flotation device.

185
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:56,251
You've all taken your
pressure pills, right?

186
00:13:56,653 --> 00:13:58,564
Yes! Stop asking!

187
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:07,524
I've got a scent, over here where
the water gets warmer.

188
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:10,248
This way!

189
00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:18,931
Bend me!

190
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:23,686
Dude! An ancient sunken city!

191
00:14:25,653 --> 00:14:29,487
Could it possibly be?
Are the old legends true?

192
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:38,163
It is! It's the fabled lost
city of Atlanta!

193
00:14:38,613 --> 00:14:39,762
Howdy, y'all!

194
00:14:42,853 --> 00:14:46,323
Welcome to Atlanta!
Folks here call me "The Colonel. "

195
00:14:49,573 --> 00:14:53,168
Have some breathers,
courtesy of our chamber of commerce.

196
00:14:56,413 --> 00:14:59,052
This is uncomfortable and humiliating!

197
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:02,246
Now, if they could put it
in the form of a suppository. . . .

198
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:05,883
Y'all enjoy your stay!
Tourism's our main source of income.

199
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,723
So see the sights, spend some money!
Please don't leave!

200
00:15:11,853 --> 00:15:15,323
Fry, I knew you were alive!
I owe you 1 0 bucks, Hermes.

201
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:17,683
The most amazing thing happened!

202
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:21,090
It's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy
Kreme. Plus there's mermaids.

203
00:15:21,493 --> 00:15:24,883
I'd like you to meet
my daughter, Umbriel.

204
00:15:25,093 --> 00:15:27,163
Umbriel, these are some Yankees.

205
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:31,930
So Atlanta was an American city
in your time?

206
00:15:32,173 --> 00:15:35,051
I think it was just an airport.
They had a place to buy nuts.

207
00:15:35,253 --> 00:15:38,723
No! Ancient Atlanta was
more than just a Delta hub!

208
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:42,932
It was a vibrant metropolis.
The equal of Paris or New York.

209
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:45,089
That's right, honey. Whatever you say.

210
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,210
Loot at these fabulous ruins.

211
00:15:47,653 --> 00:15:48,847
Turner Field. . .

212
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:50,765
. . .the Coca-Cola bottling plant. . .

213
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:53,047
. . .the airport.

214
00:15:53,573 --> 00:15:58,249
How could a city with such a fabulous
airport end up underwater?

215
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:02,646
That's a story only to be told
in the chamber of commerce video. . .

216
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:05,532
. . .narrated by folk-rock
troubadour Donovan.

217
00:16:08,613 --> 00:16:11,047
Atlanta was a city, landlocked.

218
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:15,372
Hundreds of miles from the area
we now call the Atlantic Ocean.

219
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:18,730
Yet so desperate the city's desire
for tourism...

220
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:23,290
... that they moved offshore,
became an island and bigger Delta hub.

221
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:26,889
Until the city overdeveloped,
and it started to sink.

222
00:16:28,573 --> 00:16:31,565
Knowing their fate,
the quality people ran away.

223
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:34,890
Ted Turner, Hank Aaron,
Jeff Foxworthy...

224
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:37,249
... the guy who invented
Coca-Cola...

225
00:16:37,493 --> 00:16:41,486
... the magician, and the other
so-called gods of our legends.

226
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:43,564
Though gods they were.

227
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:45,644
Also Jane Fonda was there.

228
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,249
The others remained behind...

229
00:16:48,453 --> 00:16:50,648
...on their porches with rifles...

230
00:16:50,853 --> 00:16:53,287
...and one day evolve
into mermaids...

231
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:56,964
...and sing and dance and
ring in the new.

232
00:16:57,213 --> 00:16:58,931
Hail Atlanta!

233
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:01,052
The magician?

234
00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:04,570
Wouldn't it take millions of years
to evolve into mermaids?

235
00:17:04,813 --> 00:17:08,283
Normally, yes. But the caffeine
really sped things up.

236
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:10,530
That stuff's wonderful!

237
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:15,652
When Umbriel brought home this
carpetbagger, I was against it.

238
00:17:15,973 --> 00:17:18,328
But damn if old legs here
ain't grown on me!

239
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:20,723
Shucks, Colonel!

240
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:26,325
It's very nice here, but we should go.
I miss me wife and oxygen.

241
00:17:26,573 --> 00:17:30,122
We all miss our loved ones and gases.
Come on, Fry.

242
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:32,284
Wait, I'm not going with you.

243
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:37,441
What about us?
What about your life on the surface?

244
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:39,126
You don't belong here.

245
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:43,690
She's right. Sure they got the Braves,
but it's a third-rate symphony.

246
00:17:43,893 --> 00:17:47,932
Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac!
Be reasonable!

247
00:17:48,173 --> 00:17:50,448
Do you realize if you
stay at this depth. . .

248
00:17:50,693 --> 00:17:53,082
. . .you'll permanently adapt
to the pressure?

249
00:17:53,293 --> 00:17:55,170
Realize it?
I don't even understand it!

250
00:17:55,413 --> 00:17:58,530
You'll never be able to return
to the surface.

251
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:01,691
I don't care.
I've got everything I want right here.

252
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:04,928
I'm bored! Let's go!

253
00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:09,644
You know, Fry, I've got a little place
just outside town.

254
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:11,252
You could visit, maybe?

255
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:15,521
Sorry, I'm trying to join
the country club.

256
00:18:20,853 --> 00:18:22,525
I'll miss you!

257
00:18:23,693 --> 00:18:25,490
Y'all come back now, you hear?

258
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:27,610
Let's go, damn it, let's go!

259
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:33,766
I guess this is goodbye
for me as well.

260
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,532
-Whatever.
-Later!

261
00:18:41,573 --> 00:18:43,962
My home! It burned down!

262
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:50,572
-How did this happen?
-That's a good question!

263
00:18:50,773 --> 00:18:53,048
So that's where I left my cigar.

264
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:55,847
That just raises further questions!

265
00:18:56,053 --> 00:19:00,922
These last 24 hours have been
the happiest days of my life.

266
00:19:02,453 --> 00:19:05,650
I want you to make a mer-woman
out of mer-me.

267
00:19:08,853 --> 00:19:12,641
Mercy! I do believe I'm
getting the vapors.

268
00:19:18,013 --> 00:19:19,287
What the hell is that?

269
00:19:19,853 --> 00:19:21,286
I'm a little confused too!

270
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:24,286
How do l. . .you know,
with the tail and all?

271
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:26,166
I'm not your first, am l?

272
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:30,691
I lay my eggs, then I leave
and you release your fertilizer.

273
00:19:33,053 --> 00:19:35,613
Why couldn't she be
the other kind of mermaid. . .

274
00:19:35,813 --> 00:19:38,452
. . .with fish part on top,
and lady part on bottom?

275
00:19:39,893 --> 00:19:42,566
Now who's gonna escort me
to the Debutante Ball?

276
00:19:42,813 --> 00:19:45,964
What about that rich
young dugong from Macon?

277
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,967
The engine modifications are complete.

278
00:19:50,213 --> 00:19:51,487
Prepare for launch.

279
00:19:56,773 --> 00:19:59,970
Wait! Wait for me!
Don't leave me here!

280
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:18,003
And so, in honor of his
record-breaking catch. . .

281
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:23,241
. . .I'm proud to award Bender
this check for $1 000!

282
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:28,566
-It's you!
-Yeah, buddy!

283
00:20:28,813 --> 00:20:30,166
My Manwich!

284
00:20:30,413 --> 00:20:33,928
-Are you all right? What happened?
-What about Umbriel?

285
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:37,409
Turns out I loved her,
but I wasn't in love with her.

286
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:38,841
Trouble in bed.

287
00:20:39,053 --> 00:20:41,328
It's great to have you back, buddy!

288
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:44,047
Wait!
This is no record!

289
00:20:44,253 --> 00:20:48,531
Give me back that check!
I'm giving it to some giant orphans.

290
00:20:49,093 --> 00:20:50,765
Bender, you're hurting me!

291
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:57,286
Hey, I'm trying to sleep in here!

292
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,852
Hail Atlanta!
