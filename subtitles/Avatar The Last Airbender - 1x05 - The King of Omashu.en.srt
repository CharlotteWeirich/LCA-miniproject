<i>Earth.</i>

<i>Fire.</i>

00:00:06,905 --> 00:00:08,196
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:09,262 --> 00:00:13,396
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,397 --> 00:00:17,475
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:21,788
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,948
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,110
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:30,950
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:33,156
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,157 --> 00:00:36,889
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,512
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

Book One: Water
Chapter Five: The King of Omashu

15
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,927
The Earth Kingdom city of Omashu!

16
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,134
I used to always come here to visit my friend, Bumi.

17
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:07,935
Wow. We don't have cities like this in the South Pole.

18
00:01:07,936 --> 00:01:10,229
They have buildings here that don't melt!

19
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:14,996
Well, let's go slow pokes! The real fun is inside the city!

20
00:01:14,997 --> 00:01:19,189
Wait, Aang! It could be dangerous if people find out you're the Avatar.

21
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,546
You need a disguise.

22
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:25,269
So, what am I supposed to do? Grow a mustache?

23
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:32,277
Ohh, so itchy! How do you live in this stuff?

24
00:01:32,912 --> 00:01:35,400
Great! Now you look just like my grandfather.

25
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:39,510
Technically, Aang is 112 years old.

26
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:45,052
Now let's get to skippin', young whippersnappers! The big city awaits.

27
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:04,603
You guys are gonna love Omashu. The people here are the friendliest in the world.

28
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:10,227
Rotten cabbages! What kind of slum do you think this is?

29
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:17,787
Noo! My cabbages!

30
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:22,761
Just keep smiling...

31
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:30,273
State your business!

32
00:02:30,274 --> 00:02:34,329
My business is my business, young man, and none of yours!

33
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,910
I've got half a mind to bend you over my knee and paddle your backside!

34
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:41,435
Settle down, old timer. Just tell me who you are.

35
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:48,194
Name's Bonzu Pipinpadaloxicopolis, the Third, and these are my grandkids.

36
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:53,067
Hi, June Pipinpadaloxicopolis. Nice to meet you.

37
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:55,642
You seem like a responsible young lady.

38
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:59,456
See that your grandfather stays out of trouble. Enjoy Omashu!

39
00:02:59,457 --> 00:03:01,293
We will.

40
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:06,380
Wait a minute!

41
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,020
You're a strong young boy.

42
00:03:10,021 --> 00:03:14,148
Show some respect for the elderly and carry your grandfather's bag.

43
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:15,743
Good idea!

44
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:50,461
This is the Omashu delivery system. Miles and miles of tubes and chutes.

45
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:56,204
Earthbending brings the packages up and gravity brings them down.

46
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:58,423
Great, so they get their mail on time.

47
00:03:58,424 --> 00:04:00,180
They do get their mail on time,...

48
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:05,055
...but my friend Bumi found a better use for these chutes...

49
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,868
Look around you, what do you see?

50
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:12,313
Umm... the mail system?

51
00:04:12,314 --> 00:04:14,363
Instead of seeing what they want you to see,...

52
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:17,533
...you gotta open your brain to the possibilities.

53
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:19,898
A package sending system?

54
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,066
The world's greatest super slide!

55
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:27,221
Bumi, you're a mad genius!

56
00:04:37,897 --> 00:04:42,344
One ride, then we're off to the North Pole, Airbender's honor.

57
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:45,347
This sounded like fun at first, but now that I'm here,...

58
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:49,332
...I'm starting to have second thoughts!

59
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:13,578
I'm on it!

60
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:21,116
Men, you'll be going off to combat soon.

61
00:05:21,117 --> 00:05:25,197
It's important that you be prepared for anything.

62
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,307
Aang, do something! Use your airbending!

63
00:05:36,308 --> 00:05:41,155
Yeh! Good idea! That'll make us go even faster!

64
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:17,580
Sorry!

65
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:38,159
My cabbages! You're gonna pay for this!

66
00:06:38,912 --> 00:06:41,835
Two cabbages please.

67
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:58,594
Your majesty, these juveniles were arrested for vandalism,...

68
00:06:58,595 --> 00:07:01,769
...traveling under false pretenses and malicious destruction of cabbages.

69
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,997
Off with their heads! One for each head of cabbage!

70
00:07:04,998 --> 00:07:12,540
Silence! Only the King can pass down judgment. What is your judgment, Sire?

71
00:07:22,993 --> 00:07:27,400
Throw them... a feast!

72
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:29,825
Huh?

73
00:07:37,938 --> 00:07:42,689
The people in my city have gotten fat from too many feasts,...

74
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,241
...so I hope you like your chicken with no skin.

75
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:48,022
Thanks, but I don't eat meat.

76
00:07:48,023 --> 00:07:52,567
How about you? I bet you like meat.

77
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:58,576
Is it just me, or is this guy's crown a little crooked?

78
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:03,569
So, tell me young bald one. Where are you from?

79
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,190
I'm from... Kangaroo Island.

80
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:13,742
Oh, Kangaroo Island, eh? I hear that place is really hoppin!

81
00:08:18,504 --> 00:08:21,947
What? It was pretty funny.

82
00:08:22,222 --> 00:08:29,952
Well, all these good jokes are making me tired. Guess it's time to the hay.

83
00:08:33,303 --> 00:08:41,934
There's an airbender in our presence and not just any airbender, the Avatar!

84
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:48,590
Now what do you have to say for yourself, Mr. Pipinpadaloxicopolis?

85
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:59,822
Okay! You caught me. I'm the Avatar, doing my Avatar thing, keeping the world safe.

86
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:04,933
Everything checks out, no firebenders here. So, good work everybody.

87
00:09:04,934 --> 00:09:08,914
Love each other, respect all life and don't run with your spears.

88
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,899
We'll see you next time!

89
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,676
You can't keep us here. Let us leave.

90
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:19,073
Lettuce leaf?

91
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:24,988
We're in serious trouble. This guy is nuts.

92
00:09:24,989 --> 00:09:29,309
Tomorrow the Avatar will face three deadly challenges.

93
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,912
But for now, the guards will show you to your chamber.

94
00:09:32,913 --> 00:09:35,727
My liege, do you mean the good chamber, or the bad chamber?

95
00:09:35,728 --> 00:09:37,996
The newly refurbished chamber.

96
00:09:37,997 --> 00:09:40,203
Wait, which one are we talking about?

97
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:45,218
The one that used to be the bad chamber, until the recent refurbishing that is.

98
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:49,204
Of course, we've been calling it the new chamber, but we really should number them.

99
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:55,544
Uh, take them to the refurbished chamber that was once bad!

100
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:05,648
This is a prison cell? But it's so nice.

101
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:07,824
He did say it was newly refurbished.

102
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:10,234
Nice or not, we're prisoners.

103
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,607
I wonder what these challenges are gonna be.

104
00:10:12,608 --> 00:10:16,717
We're not sticking around to find out. There's gotta be some way outta here.

105
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:18,780
The air vents!

106
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:23,409
If you think we're gonna fit through there then you're crazier then that king.

107
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,182
We can't, but Momo can.

108
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:33,057
Momo, I need you to find Appa and bust us outta here!

109
00:10:39,793 --> 00:10:43,328
Go on, boy, get Appa!

110
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:45,931
Eh, how was Appa supposed to save us anyway?

111
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:51,177
Appa is a ten ton flying bison, I think he could figure something out.

112
00:10:51,178 --> 00:10:55,762
Well, no point in arguing about it now. Get some rest, Aang.

113
00:10:55,763 --> 00:10:59,079
Looks like you'll need it for tomorrow.

114
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:10,280
Sokka! Katara! Where are my friends?

115
00:11:10,281 --> 00:11:12,931
The King will free them if you complete your challenges.

116
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:14,730
And if I fail?

117
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:18,463
He didn't say. Your staff please?

118
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:30,894
First, Avatar, what do you think of my new outfit? I want your honest opinion.

119
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:34,415
I'm waiting.

120
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,737
I... guess it's fine.

121
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,949
Excellent! You passed the first test.

122
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,698
Really?

123
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:47,877
Well, not one of the deadly tests. The real challenges are much more... challenging.

124
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:54,251
I don't have time for your crazy games! Gimme my friends back! We're leaving!

125
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:57,367
Ohh, I thought you might refuse...

126
00:11:57,368 --> 00:12:01,772
...so I will give your friends some special souvenirs.

127
00:12:01,773 --> 00:12:08,484
Those delightful rings are made of pure genemite, also known as creeping crystal.

128
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:11,607
It's crystal that grows remarkably fast.

129
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:15,470
By nightfall your friends will be completely covered in it.

130
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:21,779
Terrible fate, really. I can stop it, but only if you cooperate.

131
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,497
Ah! It's already creeping!

132
00:12:24,498 --> 00:12:26,901
I'll do as you want.

133
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:43,587
It seems I've lost my lunch box key and I'm hungry.

134
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:51,168
Ooo, there it is. Would you mind fetching it for me?

135
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:13,578
Ooo, climbing the ladder. No one's thought of that before.

136
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:47,066
That's right. Keep diving head in, I'm sure it'll work eventually.

137
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:05,117
There, enjoy your lunch! I want my friends back, now!

138
00:14:05,118 --> 00:14:13,248
Uh, not yet. I need help with another matter. It seems I've lost my pet Flopsy.

139
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:14,862
Okay, found him!

140
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:18,630
Bring him to me! Daddy wants a kiss from Flopsy!

141
00:14:18,631 --> 00:14:20,972
Come here, Flopsy!

142
00:14:27,751 --> 00:14:30,863
Flopsy, wait! Flopsy!

143
00:14:34,622 --> 00:14:36,225
Flopsy!

144
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:49,597
Wait a minute?

145
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:54,164
Flopsy?

146
00:14:58,653 --> 00:15:01,116
Flopsy!

147
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:13,528
Awww, that's a good boy! Yes, who has a soft belly?

148
00:15:14,736 --> 00:15:16,096
Guys, are you okay?

149
00:15:16,097 --> 00:15:21,752
Other than the crystal slowly encasing my entire body, doing great.

150
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:26,667
Awww, yes.

151
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:30,869
Come on. I'm ready for the next challenge.

152
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:43,561
Your final test is a duel and as a special treat you may choose your opponent.

153
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:53,023
Point and choose.

154
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:58,832
So, you're saying whoever I point to, that's the person I get to fight?

155
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,623
Choose wisely.

156
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,757
I... choose...

157
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:07,498
...you!

158
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,807
Wrong choice!

159
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:38,141
You thought I was a frail old man,...

160
00:16:38,142 --> 00:16:42,387
...but I'm the most powerful earthbender you'll ever see.

161
00:16:42,388 --> 00:16:44,751
Can I fight the guy with the axe instead?

162
00:16:44,752 --> 00:16:51,369
There are no... take-back-sees' in my kingdom. You might need this!

163
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:00,543
Typical airbender tactic, avoid and evade.

164
00:17:00,544 --> 00:17:05,110
I'd hoped the Avatar would be less predictable.

165
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:12,821
Don't you have any surprises for me? Sooner or later, you'll have to strike back.

166
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:31,332
Oh, you'll have to be a little more creative than that!

167
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:46,291
Did someone leave the windows open? It feels a little drafty in here!

168
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:50,192
Are you hoping I'll catch a cold?

169
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,856
How are you going to get me from way over there?

170
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:30,571
Hehe! Well done, Avatar. You fight with much fire in your heart.

171
00:19:33,154 --> 00:19:35,161
Huh?

172
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:46,945
You've passed all my tests. Now, you must answer one question.

173
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:50,924
That's not fair! You said you would release my friends if I finished your tests.

174
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:54,712
Oh, but what's the point of tests if you don't learn anything?

175
00:19:54,713 --> 00:19:56,480
Oh come on!

176
00:19:56,481 --> 00:20:05,623
Answer this one question and I will set your friends free. What... is my name?

177
00:20:05,624 --> 00:20:10,851
From the looks of your friends, I'd say you only have a few minutes.

178
00:20:10,852 --> 00:20:12,640
How am I supposed to know his name?

179
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:15,761
Think about the challenges, maybe it's some kind of riddle.

180
00:20:15,762 --> 00:20:16,347
I got it!

181
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:16,825
Yeh?

182
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:22,969
He's an earthbender, right? Rocky! You know, because of all the rocks?

183
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,342
We're gonna keep trying, but that is a good backup.

184
00:20:25,343 --> 00:20:29,593
Okay, so back to the challenges. I got a key from the waterfall.

185
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:32,163
I saved his pet and I had a duel.

186
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,539
And what did you learn?

187
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,217
Well, everything was different than I expected.

188
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:39,176
And...?

189
00:20:39,177 --> 00:20:42,231
Well, they weren't straightforward.

190
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:50,814
To solve each test, I had to think differently than I usually would. I know his name!

191
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:54,512
I solved the question the same way I solved the challenges.

192
00:20:54,513 --> 00:21:01,074
As you said a long time ago, I had to open my brain to the possibilities.

193
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:06,636
Bumi, you're a mad genius!

194
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:14,721
Oh, Aang. It's good to see you. You haven't changed a bit. Literally.

195
00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:16,364
Uh, over here!

196
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:17,931
Little help?

197
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:25,722
Genemite is made of rock candy. Delicious!

198
00:21:25,723 --> 00:21:29,348
So this crazy king is your old friend, Bumi?

199
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:33,120
Who you calling old? Okay. I'm old.

200
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:37,106
Why did you do all this instead of just telling Aang who you were?

201
00:21:37,107 --> 00:21:43,411
First of all, it's pretty fun messing with people, hehe, but I do have a reason.

202
00:21:43,412 --> 00:21:46,112
Aang, you have a difficult task ahead.

203
00:21:46,113 --> 00:21:49,379
The world has changed in the hundred years you've been gone.

204
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:55,212
It's the duty of the Avatar to restore balance to the world by defeating Fire Lord Ozai.

205
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,896
You have much to learn.

206
00:21:56,897 --> 00:22:02,210
You must master the four elements and confront the Fire Lord, and when you do,...

207
00:22:02,211 --> 00:22:05,945
...I hope you will think like a mad genius!

208
00:22:08,311 --> 00:22:11,507
And it looks like you're in good hands.

209
00:22:11,508 --> 00:22:16,219
You'll need your friends to help defeat the Fire Nation.

210
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:19,136
And you'll need Momo too.

211
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:26,108
Thank you for your wisdom. But before we leave, I have a challenge for you!

212
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:34,224
My cabbages!

213
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:38,799
