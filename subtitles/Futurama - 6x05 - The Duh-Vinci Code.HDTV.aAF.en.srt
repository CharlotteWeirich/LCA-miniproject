<i>Who Dares To Be A Millionaire?</i>

00:00:28,249 --> 00:00:31,285
Tremble before Morbo's mighty
likeability,

7
00:00:31,353 --> 00:00:35,222
as I chit-chat with our first
contestant, Philip J. Fry.

10
00:00:42,464 --> 00:00:44,231
Give him hell, Morbo!

11
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:47,935
Prepare for pleasantries!

12
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:50,571
So, Fry, what do you do
for a living?

13
00:00:50,638 --> 00:00:53,073
Me? Um... can I phone a friend?

14
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:54,575
Chit-chat achieved!

16
00:00:56,845 --> 00:00:58,946
Are you ready to play?

17
00:00:59,013 --> 00:01:02,249
I didn't come to play;
I came to win.

18
00:01:02,317 --> 00:01:03,751
Now let's play.

19
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:05,552
For one dollar...

20
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:09,390
Is it...

21
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:14,461
B: Nail!
Final answer!

22

<i>HERMES:

25
00:01:20,135 --> 00:01:22,870
Don't you ever stop to think
before you speak?

26
00:01:22,937 --> 00:01:24,738
I never stop to think about it.

27
00:01:24,806 --> 00:01:26,173
Aw, leave Fry alone.

28
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:29,743
His intelligence is just a
little... differenty.

29
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:31,044
(imitates Redd Foxx):
You a big dummy!

30
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:32,446
Hey, I'm beginning to think

31
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:34,615
you guys don't think
I'm very smart.

32
00:01:34,682 --> 00:01:37,584
You can barely remember
 your own name, Einstein.

33
00:01:37,652 --> 00:01:39,720
Einstein is a hard name
to remember.

34
00:01:39,788 --> 00:01:41,155
(groans) Ow!

35
00:01:41,222 --> 00:01:42,489
Smeesh, Professor.

36
00:01:42,557 --> 00:01:43,924
Don't have a shmaneurysm.

37
00:01:43,992 --> 00:01:45,926
Fry's your distant relative.

38
00:01:45,994 --> 00:01:47,194
Not distant enough.

39
00:01:47,262 --> 00:01:48,595
I'll be a monkey's uncle

40
00:01:48,663 --> 00:01:50,197
if I'm this monkey's nephew.

41
00:01:50,265 --> 00:01:53,467
(sobs): But you're
my only family.

42
00:01:53,535 --> 00:01:56,470
Who will hug me if I achieve
something?

43
00:01:56,538 --> 00:01:59,440
Oh, perhaps I've been too harsh.

44
00:01:59,507 --> 00:02:02,276
Come, lad, take my hand
and I'll explain

45
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:06,013
why I find you so repugnant.

46
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,850
All my life, I've been
inspired by great minds...

47
00:02:09,918 --> 00:02:13,754
Euclid, Copernicus, Braino...

48
00:02:13,822 --> 00:02:17,758
And my personal role model,
Leonardo Da Vinci.

49
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:19,226
What turned them to stone?

50
00:02:19,294 --> 00:02:20,594
(groans): Oh...

51
00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:23,931
Da Vinci was history's greatest
artist and inventor.

52

54
00:02:26,868 --> 00:02:28,402
Voilà!

55
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,370
He invented flying machines,

56
00:02:30,438 --> 00:02:32,806
war engines, submarines...

57
00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:34,708
Uh-oh. Nibbler
died in the wall.

58
00:02:34,776 --> 00:02:38,445
That's not Nibbler. That's my
most precious possession.

59
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:40,047
Leonardo's beard!

60
00:02:40,114 --> 00:02:44,485
I paid a fortune for it at an
auction of historic body parts.

61
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:47,688
Oh, I suppose if I have an
Achilles' heel,

62
00:02:47,755 --> 00:02:50,891
it's because I bought it at
that same auction.

63
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,960
Indeed so.

64
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:54,895
Most indeededly.

65
00:02:54,963 --> 00:02:56,663
Careful with that, you fool!

66
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:57,764
(sneezes)

67
00:02:57,832 --> 00:02:58,932
No!

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,435
No!

69
00:03:01,503 --> 00:03:03,403
But possibly yes.

70
00:03:03,471 --> 00:03:05,339
What is it Professor?

71
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:09,142
Oh, my!

72
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,379
It's Da Vinci's fabled
lost invention.

73
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:13,747
Even the scholars who wrote

74
00:03:13,815 --> 00:03:17,017
of this device had no
idea what it was for.

75
00:03:17,085 --> 00:03:19,620
And now, at last, neither do I!

76
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:21,755
Maybe we can figure it out.

77
00:03:21,823 --> 00:03:24,758
We? (laughs)

78
00:03:24,826 --> 00:03:27,661
Well, I may not have
brain smarts,

79
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:30,163
but at least I have
street smarts.

81
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:35,202
I was in the hospital two weeks.

82
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,270
No one visited me.

83
00:03:36,337 --> 00:03:37,571
Quiet, you!

84
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,706
I'm trying to deduce
the function

85
00:03:39,774 --> 00:03:41,441
of Da Vinci's lost invention.

86
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:42,943
Not even a card.

87
00:03:43,011 --> 00:03:45,946
He might have hidden a clue
in one of his other works.

88
00:03:46,014 --> 00:03:49,883
<i>Ergo, I sent Bender out for

89

BENDER:
I'm back!

90
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:52,953
Everybody at Kinko's
was an idiot,

91
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:55,289
so I just brought the original.

92
00:03:55,356 --> 00:03:57,658
(grunts)

93
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,566
Jesus Christ...
and his 12 Apostles.

94
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:06,934
That's odd.

95
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:09,636
This hand here doesn't
belong to anybody.

96
00:04:09,704 --> 00:04:12,606
And it's pointing a knife
at James the Lesser.

97
00:04:12,674 --> 00:04:14,708
That's the great thing about
that hand.

98
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:16,877
And what about these
funky table legs?

99
00:04:16,945 --> 00:04:19,880
It's like they're from some
other, funkier painting.

100
00:04:19,948 --> 00:04:22,516
Maybe Da Vinci painted over
something else.

101
00:04:22,584 --> 00:04:24,484
It's called a pentimento.

102
00:04:24,552 --> 00:04:26,019
That's true, Dr. Zoidberg.

103
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:28,322
Eh... how did you know that?

104
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:30,424
My doctorate is in art history.

FRY:
My God! Saint James was a robot!

113
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:55,048
My God! Da Vinci left his legs
unpainted as a clue.

114
00:04:55,116 --> 00:04:59,319
My God! This is the greatest
mystery of all time.

115
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:00,654
We must fly to Rome

116
00:05:00,722 --> 00:05:03,090
and exhume the body
of Saint James.

117
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:04,958
Didn't we used to be
a delivery company?

118
00:05:05,026 --> 00:05:06,226
To the ship.

Sure, why not?

124
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:43,556
No time!
I've found a clue

125
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:47,126
that could unlock all
the secrets of history.

We're in Rome.

130

Don't be stupid.

Aha! The markings indicate how

Okay, we're there.

Brothers and sisters,
let us pry.

141
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:29,235
It's true!

142
00:06:29,303 --> 00:06:31,838
Saint James really was a robot.

143
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:34,507
I bet he's up in
Robot Heaven right now.

144
00:06:34,575 --> 00:06:36,676
So he won't miss his eyes.

Nay, I am not Saint James.

149
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:55,862
Enough of your lies,
Saint James.

<i>We saw you in The Last Supper.</i>

The great man Leonardo built me
as an artist's model.

152
00:07:01,835 --> 00:07:04,604
When I took repose in this
coffin, I carefully tossed

153
00:07:04,672 --> 00:07:07,073
the real Saint James
in yonder heap.

I'm sure you have many
questions.

156
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:12,111
Come, there is a chamber

157
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:15,148
where I used to speak
with Pope John the Pient.

158
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,353
Ah, I told him I'd be
back in five minutes.

159

Ah, well, he'll make

I am Animatronio, guardian of
Da Vinci's great secret.

162

He left my legs visible in
the painting as a clue,

163
00:07:34,068 --> 00:07:37,170
then dispatched me hither to
await his shadow society

165
00:07:39,373 --> 00:07:41,207
Hi, Animatronio.

166
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:44,377
You personally knew Da Vinci?

167
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:45,645
(girlish squeal) Was he nice?

168
00:07:45,713 --> 00:07:47,213
How did his hair smell?

169
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:50,950
And on a personal note, what is
the function of this device?

170
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:54,353
<i>Halt! You know not the function
of the machina magnifica?</i>

171
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:55,855
Then thou art not

172
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:58,124
members of the shadow society!

173
00:07:58,192 --> 00:07:59,292
The what, now?

174
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:01,360
Not one more word
shall I breathe.

175
00:08:01,428 --> 00:08:03,296
Not even about
the great fountain

176
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:05,465
where thou mayest find the...

177
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:06,899
Wait...

178
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:09,368
Thou didst not know about
the fountain, didst thou?

179
00:08:09,436 --> 00:08:10,503
Curses!

180
00:08:10,571 --> 00:08:12,138
I must be punished.

181
00:08:12,206 --> 00:08:14,440
(yelling)

182
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:16,175
Quick, we must find out
what he knows,

183
00:08:16,243 --> 00:08:19,212
before he
flays himself to death.

184
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,313
Where is the great fountain?

185
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,514
What makes it so great?

186
00:08:21,582 --> 00:08:23,416
Why does a robot
need a codpiece?

187
00:08:23,484 --> 00:08:25,952
Fie, thou fen-suckled
bumbailey!

188
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,887
Thou willst never pry
information

189
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:29,622
from these mechanical lips!

190
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,923
Just tell us, already.

191
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:34,026
Okay, the fountain
thou seekest is-is...

192
00:08:34,094 --> 00:08:35,995
(gasps)

193
00:08:36,063 --> 00:08:40,166
And so dies our hope of
solving this mystery.

194
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:41,367
Come on, gang.

195
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:42,502
Let's go home.

196
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:45,071
Wait! Let's not
give up so easily.

197
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:47,807
Animatronio mentioned
a fountain.

198
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,910
That's a statue of Neptune,
god of water.

199
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:54,814
The number of points on his
trident is three, or "trey."

200
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:57,817
The "U" in his name is written
like "V."

201
00:08:57,885 --> 00:08:59,552
Trey... V...

202
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,855
Trey... Trevi!
It's the Trevi Fountain!

203
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:05,391
There can be no question!

204
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:06,325
But Professor...?

205
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:07,760
There can be no question!

206
00:09:07,828 --> 00:09:12,832
Wow, it hasn't changed
in a thousand years.

207
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,835
(growling) (camera snapping)

208
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:18,905
Okay, everyone,
into the fountain.

209
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:19,972
What are you, senile?

210
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,175
I'm not jumping in there.

211
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:24,577
Hey, look... coins.

212
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:28,714
(muffled shouting)

213
00:09:28,782 --> 00:09:31,050
(grunting)

214
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:36,589
(growls)

215
00:09:36,657 --> 00:09:38,424
(gun hammers cocking)

216
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,726
(gunshots)

217
00:09:40,794 --> 00:09:42,962
(gurgling)

218
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:46,566
I got 48 cents.

219
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:51,037
(gasps) There's one more
nickel, and it's a big one!

220
00:09:55,642 --> 00:09:57,743
(muffled gurgling)

221
00:10:01,048 --> 00:10:02,648
(flushing)

222
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:06,986
Quickly, into the sewer hole.

223
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:11,657
Why?
(gasps)

224
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:21,467
(shouting)

225
00:10:21,535 --> 00:10:23,069
(grunting)

226
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:27,740
What's this dump?

227
00:10:34,882 --> 00:10:36,249
Professor:
My God!

228
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:37,783
It's the Pantheon!

229
00:10:37,851 --> 00:10:40,253
LEELA:
This place is 3,000 years old.

230
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,555
What could possibly
be left to discover?

231
00:10:42,623 --> 00:10:45,524
Maybe something
about ourselves, Leela.

232
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:47,860
Wait! What's under
that blanket?

233
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:52,632
My God!
Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man!

234
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:54,533
It's truly a masterpiece.

235
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:58,838
Note how the perspective lines
draw the eye right to his dong.

236
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,974
Say, what's this?

237
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:04,777
Anyone hear something?

238
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:06,012
It's a coin slot.

239
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,681
Bender, insert
that giant nickel.

240
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:10,049
Sure.

241
00:11:10,117 --> 00:11:11,050
(laughing)

242
00:11:11,118 --> 00:11:13,219
(clanking)

243
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:14,987
Aah!

244
00:11:15,055 --> 00:11:16,222
Hush, Bender!

245
00:11:17,457 --> 00:11:20,726
What's your game,
Vitruvian Man?

246
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:28,067
Ooh!

247
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:32,605
Professor: I withdraw the
question, Vitruvian Man.

248
00:11:32,673 --> 00:11:36,008
Da Vinci's lost workshop.

249
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:37,843
At the risk of sounding stupid,

250
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:39,578
do these things actually work?

251
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:41,781
Of course not, stupid!

252
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:45,217
I mean... that flying machine's
as aerodynamic as a sofa!

253
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:47,987
How could it possibly get off
the ground?

254
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:51,157
In a way thou shalt
ne'er discover!

255
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:53,626
(all gasping)

256
00:11:53,694 --> 00:11:55,261
Hi, Animatronio.

257
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:57,363
I feign death and stalk thee,

258
00:11:57,431 --> 00:12:00,299
that I might preserve the
greatest of Leonardo's secrets.

259
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:01,367
Hee-yah!

260
00:12:05,572 --> 00:12:08,007
All right, buddy,
we want secrets.

261
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:09,809
And they better be ancient!

262
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:11,544
Porco metallico!

263
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:15,514
Ne'er shall I reveal how these
wondrous machines fit together!

264
00:12:15,582 --> 00:12:17,283
Professor:
They fit together?!

265
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:18,417
I said no such thing.

266
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:19,618
And then I died!

267
00:12:19,686 --> 00:12:20,886
(raspy screech)

268
00:12:23,824 --> 00:12:24,957
You're right, Professor.

269
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:26,525
This thing doesn't fly.

270
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:28,227
Don't sit in there, you idiot!

271
00:12:28,295 --> 00:12:29,762
That's dangerous!

272
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:35,568
Heh-wha...?

273
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:46,412
(clicking, ratcheting)

274
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:53,919
(gasps)

275
00:12:53,987 --> 00:12:56,555
No wonder this contraption
isn't aerodynamic!

276
00:12:56,623 --> 00:12:59,592
It's not an aircraft,
it's a spacecraft!

277
00:13:01,161 --> 00:13:05,264
Basta! As I live, thou shan't
discover the great secret!

278
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:14,240
FRY:
Bye, Animatronio!

279
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,034
(both grunt)

280
00:13:42,102 --> 00:13:43,436
My God!

281
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:46,138
Why would Leonardo's machine
have brought us here?

282
00:13:46,206 --> 00:13:48,874
Uh, I don't know.

283
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:51,610
I am Leonardo. guy.

284
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:52,645
(both gasp)

285
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:55,047
Welcome to Planet Vinci.

286
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:01,253
Professor:
My God!

287
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:03,055
FRY:
That's what I was gonna say!

288
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,950
<i>Professor:
Leonardo!</i>

289
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,452
You're alive?! Here?!

290
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,587
(sighs)

291
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,255
You've learned my great secret.

292
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:18,424
I was but a visitor to Earth.

293
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:22,027
In truth, I am what you call
"a space alien."

294
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:23,362
(gasps)

295
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,897
It's an honor to meet you,
Leonardo.

296
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,966
<i>And might I say, you were great
in Titanic.</i>

297
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,801
<i>The Beach... eh.</i>

298
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,104
That's Leonardo DiCaprio,
you blockhead!

299
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,405
(groans)

300
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:34,840
Heh.
Looks like eating rocks

301
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,675
wasn't as dumb as you said.

302
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,814
FRY: So what do people
do for fun here?

303
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,716
Do you enjoy partying
all night,

304
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,151
with plenty of ale
and lusty women?

305
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,152
I sure do!

306
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,654
Not us.

307
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:53,792
We spend our leisure time
in the mathematics museum.

308
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,263
Planet Vinci is basically
a single colossal university.

309
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,598
How's your football team?

310
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,599
Learned.

311
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:01,900
Ooh!

312
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:04,303
I'm going to check out
that math lecture.

313
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:08,273
All this knowledge is
giving me a raging "brainer."

314
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:11,076
Would, uh, you like to hear
the lecture, too, Fry?

315
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:14,413
No. It would just go in one ear
and our some other hole.

316
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,248
Come. Sit down.

317
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,383
Now, that I can do.

318
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,684
Ow!

319
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:22,187
I have a terrible secret
to confess, Mr. DiCaprio.

320
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,189
I'm not very smart.

321
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,158
I appreciate your candor.

322
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:29,795
I don't even know what
language you're speaking.

323
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:30,929
(sighs)

324
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:33,399
I, too, have a confession.

325
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,868
You see, here on Planet Vinci,

326
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,303
I am the stupidest person.

327
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,206
What?! Who'd possibly
think you're stupid?

328
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,841
Duh! I'm Leonardo!

329
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,310
I don't know the mass
of the Higgs boson.

330
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,913
Duh! I have
to draw in pencil,

331
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:51,550
'cause I don't know
how to use rendering software.

332
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,953
(couple laughing)

333
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,055
Stupid Biff!

334
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,289
Thinks he's so smart.

335
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,058
He looks stronger
than you, too.

336
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:03,095
I went to Earth because I could
no longer stand the ridicule.

337
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:06,632
But being surrounded
by even stupider people

338
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,500
was equally infuriating.

339
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,769
I can see myself
in your shiny button.

340
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,938
Inventing is what
makes me happy.

341
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:16,842
Or did, until I misplaced
the plans for my masterpiece.

342
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,177
You mean these?

343
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,078
(gasps)

344
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,346
The machina magnifica!

345
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,248
Oh! Infinite joy!

346
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:27,219
Fry, my friend, you have given
my life meaning again!

347
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:30,556
That calculus lecture
was harder than I expected.

348
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:34,193
We had to answer every question
in the form of an opera.

349
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,161
I have a lot of homework
for tomorrow,

350
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:40,165
if I don't want to be...
♪ embarrassed. ♪

351
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:44,870
(bright, lilting Renaissance
folk melody playing)

352
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,310
♪ ♪

353
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,789
♪ ♪

354
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,560
(harsh buzz)

355
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,998
(class laughing)

356
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,515
(armpit squeaking)

357
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:31,617
(catcalls, booing)

358
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,218
Thank you. Thank you.

359
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:36,054
And if you like that,
you'll love our main event.

360
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:40,359
Ladies and gentlemen...
Leonardo DiCaprio!

361
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,594
(cheering)

362
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,496
I mean DaVinci!

363
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:48,634
(booing)

364
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,670
For centuries,
you've ridiculed me.

365
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,472
Especially you, Biff.

366
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,406
Nice hat!

367
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:55,874
AUDIENCE:
Ooh!

368
00:17:55,942 --> 00:18:00,813
But, at long last, this
invention will show you.

369
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,214
'Twill show you all!

370
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:07,219
Behold, my unstoppable
doomsday machine!

371
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:08,620
And I helped!

372
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:12,291
Wait... you told me it was an
unstoppable ice cream machine.

373
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:15,027
Ice cream is just a
byproduct of the machine.

374
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,263
Its primary purpose it to
exterminate everyone

375
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:21,200
who ever made me feel inferior!

376
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,503
Ooh! I'm so scared!

377
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:27,005
Bring it on, dum-dum!

378
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:30,108
(mocking laughter)

379
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,443
Oh, yeah?

380
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:32,911
Let's see how hard
you're laughing

381
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:36,381
when my doomsday machine
chops off your face!

382
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,962
Leonardo, stop!

383
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,063
(audience gasps)

384
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,031
I want in on this!

385
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,833
Are you crazy, Professor?

386
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,568
I hate these nerds!

387
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,437
Just 'cause
I'm stupider than them,

388
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,606
they think they're
smarter than me.

389
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:04,877
Kill them all...
starting with the math teacher!

390
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:12,050
(screaming)

391
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:21,426
I knew this final invention
would be a humdinger.

392
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,794
Yes.

393
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:26,164
We three idiots will finally
have our revenge.

394
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:27,833
I don't think so.

395
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:32,304
You two make me ashamed
to call myself an idiot.

396
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:38,677
There's always going to be
someone smarter than you,

397
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:39,945
so the only way to be happy

398
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,780
is to make the most
of what you've got.

399
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,515
But you've got nothing.

400
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,583
Oh, no?

401
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,084
I've got one single nail,

402
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,353
and another nail
to nail it in with,

403
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,989
and I'm gonna stop this infernal
ice cream machine

404
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,257
once and for all.

405
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,428
Aah! Oh! Oh!

406
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,201
(groaning, screaming)

407
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,738
Oh! Oh! Ow!

408
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:14,579
(laughing)

409
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,248
Some doomsday machine!

410
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,083
It barely killed anyone!

411
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:18,951
Oh, yeah?

412
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,753
Well, take this!

413
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,657
Oh, my.

414
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,793
Poor Leonardo DaVinci.

415
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,862
He sure was stupid.

416
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:35,867
Fry, I admire what you did today

417
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:39,538
and I'm deeply sorry for
insulting your intellect...

418
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,274
Your tiny, tiny intellect.

419
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:44,443
Oops! There I go
again, you dope.

420
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,877
Uh, I mean, dummy.

421
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:47,145
It's okay.

422
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,448
I may not be clever,
but I have a good heart.

423
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,383
That's what my mom used to say.

424
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:53,452
She was a wise woman.

425
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,120
FRY: Also that I'm not
much to look at.

426
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:59,342
Professor: <i>A wise woman indeed.</i>

427
00:21:00,483 --> 00:21:02,505
I can't believe it!
I'm gonna die!

428
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:03,714
Next Thursday...

429
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:30,058
