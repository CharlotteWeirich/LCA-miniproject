00:00:28,249 --> 00:00:31,285
Tremble before Morbo's mighty
likeability,

7
00:00:31,353 --> 00:00:35,222
as I chit-chat with our first
contestant, Philip J. Fry.

10
00:00:42,464 --> 00:00:44,231
Give him hell, Morbo!

11
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:47,935
Prepare for pleasantries!

12
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:50,571
So, Fry, what do you do
for a living?

13
00:00:50,638 --> 00:00:53,073
Me? Um... can I phone a friend?

14
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:54,575
Chit-chat achieved!

16
00:00:56,845 --> 00:00:58,946
Are you ready to play?

17
00:00:59,013 --> 00:01:02,249
I didn't come to play;
I came to win.

18
00:01:02,317 --> 00:01:03,751
Now let's play.

19
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:05,552
For one dollar...

20
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:09,390
Is it...

21
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:14,461
B: Nail!
Final answer!

22

<i>HERMES:

25
00:01:20,135 --> 00:01:22,870
Don't you ever stop to think
before you speak?

26
00:01:22,937 --> 00:01:24,738
I never stop to think about it.

27
00:01:24,806 --> 00:01:26,173
Aw, leave Fry alone.

28
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:29,743
His intelligence is just a
little... differenty.

29
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:31,044
(imitates Redd Foxx):
You a big dummy!

30
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:32,446
Hey, I'm beginning to think

31
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:34,615
you guys don't think
I'm very smart.

32
00:01:34,682 --> 00:01:37,584
You can barely remember
 your own name, Einstein.

33
00:01:37,652 --> 00:01:39,720
Einstein is a hard name
to remember.

34
00:01:39,788 --> 00:01:41,155
(groans) Ow!

35
00:01:41,222 --> 00:01:42,489
Smeesh, Professor.

36
00:01:42,557 --> 00:01:43,924
Don't have a shmaneurysm.

37
00:01:43,992 --> 00:01:45,926
Fry's your distant relative.

38
00:01:45,994 --> 00:01:47,194
Not distant enough.

39
00:01:47,262 --> 00:01:48,595
I'll be a monkey's uncle

40
00:01:48,663 --> 00:01:50,197
if I'm this monkey's nephew.

41
00:01:50,265 --> 00:01:53,467
(sobs): But you're
my only family.

42
00:01:53,535 --> 00:01:56,470
Who will hug me if I achieve
something?

43
00:01:56,538 --> 00:01:59,440
Oh, perhaps I've been too harsh.

44
00:01:59,507 --> 00:02:02,276
Come, lad, take my hand
and I'll explain

45
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:06,013
why I find you so repugnant.

46
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,850
All my life, I've been
inspired by great minds...

47
00:02:09,918 --> 00:02:13,754
Euclid, Copernicus, Braino...

48
00:02:13,822 --> 00:02:17,758
And my personal role model,
Leonardo Da Vinci.

49
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:19,226
What turned them to stone?

50
00:02:19,294 --> 00:02:20,594
(groans): Oh...

51
00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:23,931
Da Vinci was history's greatest
artist and inventor.

52

00:02:26,868 --> 00:02:28,402
VoilÃ !

55
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,370
He invented flying machines,

56
00:02:30,438 --> 00:02:32,806
war engines, submarines...

57
00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:34,708
Uh-oh. Nibbler
died in the wall.

58
00:02:34,776 --> 00:02:38,445
That's not Nibbler. That's my
most precious possession.

59
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:40,047
Leonardo's beard!

60
00:02:40,114 --> 00:02:44,485
I paid a fortune for it at an
auction of historic body parts.

61
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:47,688
Oh, I suppose if I have an
Achilles' heel,

62
00:02:47,755 --> 00:02:50,891
it's because I bought it at
that same auction.

63
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,960
Indeed so.

64
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:54,895
Most indeededly.

65
00:02:54,963 --> 00:02:56,663
Careful with that, you fool!

66
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:57,764
(sneezes)

67
00:02:57,832 --> 00:02:58,932
No!

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,435
No!

69
00:03:01,503 --> 00:03:03,403
But possibly yes.

70
00:03:03,471 --> 00:03:05,339
What is it Professor?

71
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:09,142
Oh, my!

72
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,379
It's Da Vinci's fabled
lost invention.

73
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:13,747
Even the scholars who wrote

74
00:03:13,815 --> 00:03:17,017
of this device had no
idea what it was for.

75
00:03:17,085 --> 00:03:19,620
And now, at last, neither do I!

76
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:21,755
Maybe we can figure it out.

77
00:03:21,823 --> 00:03:24,758
We? (laughs)

78
00:03:24,826 --> 00:03:27,661
Well, I may not have
brain smarts,

79
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:30,163
but at least I have
street smarts.

81
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:35,202
I was in the hospital two weeks.

82
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,270
No one visited me.

83
00:03:36,337 --> 00:03:37,571
Quiet, you!

84
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,706
I'm trying to deduce
the function

85
00:03:39,774 --> 00:03:41,441
of Da Vinci's lost invention.

86
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:42,943
Not even a card.

87
00:03:43,011 --> 00:03:45,946
He might have hidden a clue
in one of his other works.

88
00:03:46,014 --> 00:03:49,883
<i>Ergo, I sent Bender out for

BENDER:
I'm back!

90
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:52,953
Everybody at Kinko's
was an idiot,

91
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:55,289
so I just brought the original.

92
00:03:55,356 --> 00:03:57,658

93
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,566
Jesus Christ...
and his 12 Apostles.

94
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:06,934
That's odd.

95
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:09,636
This hand here doesn't
belong to anybody.

96
00:04:09,704 --> 00:04:12,606
And it's pointing a knife
at James the Lesser.

97
00:04:12,674 --> 00:04:14,708
That's the great thing about
that hand.

98
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:16,877
And what about these
funky table legs?

99
00:04:16,945 --> 00:04:19,880
It's like they're from some
other, funkier painting.

100
00:04:19,948 --> 00:04:22,516
Maybe Da Vinci painted over
something else.

101
00:04:22,584 --> 00:04:24,484
It's called a pentimento.

102
00:04:24,552 --> 00:04:26,019
That's true, Dr. Zoidberg.

103
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:28,322
Eh... how did you know that?

104
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:30,424
My doctorate is in art history.

FRY:
My God! Saint James was a robot!

113
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:55,048
My God! Da Vinci left his legs
unpainted as a clue.

114
00:04:55,116 --> 00:04:59,319
My God! This is the greatest
mystery of all time.

115
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:00,654
We must fly to Rome

116
00:05:00,722 --> 00:05:03,090
and exhume the body
of Saint James.

117

Didn't we used to be
a delivery company?

118
00:05:05,026 --> 00:05:06,226
To the ship.

124
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:43,556
No time!
I've found a clue

125
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:47,126
that could unlock all
the secrets of history.

Don't be stupid.

141
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:29,235
It's true!

142
00:06:29,303 --> 00:06:31,838
Saint James really was a robot.

143
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:34,507
I bet he's up in
Robot Heaven right now.

144
00:06:34,575 --> 00:06:36,676
So he won't miss his eyes.

Nay, I am not Saint James.

Enough of your lies,

<i>We saw you in The Last Supper.</i>

The great man Leonardo built me
as an artist's model.

152
00:07:01,835 --> 00:07:04,604
When I took repose in this
coffin, I carefully tossed

153
00:07:04,672 --> 00:07:07,073
the real Saint James
in yonder heap.

I'm sure you have many
questions.

156
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:12,111
Come, there is a chamber

157
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:15,148
where I used to speak
with Pope John the Pient.

158

Ah, I told him I'd be
back in five minutes.

159

Ah, well, he'll make

Da Vinci's great secret.

He left my legs visible in
the painting as a clue,

163
00:07:34,068 --> 00:07:37,170
then dispatched me hither to
await his shadow society

165
00:07:39,373 --> 00:07:41,207
Hi, Animatronio.

166
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:44,377
You personally knew Da Vinci?

167
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:45,645
(girlish squeal) Was he nice?

168
00:07:45,713 --> 00:07:47,213
How did his hair smell?

169
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:50,950
And on a personal note, what is
the function of this device?

170
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:54,353
<i>Halt! You know not the function
of the machina magnifica?</i>

171
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:55,855
Then thou art not

172
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:58,124
members of the shadow society!

173
00:07:58,192 --> 00:07:59,292
The what, now?

174
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:01,360
Not one more word
shall I breathe.

175
00:08:01,428 --> 00:08:03,296
Not even about
the great fountain

176
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:05,465
where thou mayest find the...

177
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:06,899
Wait...

178
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:09,368
Thou didst not know about
the fountain, didst thou?

179
00:08:09,436 --> 00:08:10,503
Curses!

180
00:08:10,571 --> 00:08:12,138
I must be punished.

181
00:08:12,206 --> 00:08:14,440
(yelling)

182
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:16,175
Quick, we must find out
what he knows,

183
00:08:16,243 --> 00:08:19,212
before he
flays himself to death.

184
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,313
Where is the great fountain?

185
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,514
What makes it so great?

186
00:08:21,582 --> 00:08:23,416
Why does a robot
need a codpiece?

187
00:08:23,484 --> 00:08:25,952
Fie, thou fen-suckled
bumbailey!

188
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,887
Thou willst never pry
information

189
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:29,622
from these mechanical lips!

190
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,923
Just tell us, already.

191
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:34,026
Okay, the fountain
thou seekest is-is...

192
00:08:34,094 --> 00:08:35,995
(gasps)

193
00:08:36,063 --> 00:08:40,166
And so dies our hope of
solving this mystery.

194
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:41,367
Come on, gang.

195
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:42,502
Let's go home.

196
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:45,071
Wait! Let's not
give up so easily.

197
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:47,807
Animatronio mentioned
a fountain.

198
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,910
That's a statue of Neptune,
god of water.

199
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:54,814
The number of points on his
trident is three, or "trey."

200
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:57,817
The "U" in his name is written
like "V."

201
00:08:57,885 --> 00:08:59,552
Trey... V...

202
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,855
Trey... Trevi!
It's the Trevi Fountain!

203
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:05,391
There can be no question!

204
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:06,325
But Professor...?

205
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:07,760
There can be no question!

206
00:09:07,828 --> 00:09:12,832
Wow, it hasn't changed
in a thousand years.

207
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,835
(growling) (camera snapping)

208
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:18,905
Okay, everyone,
into the fountain.

209
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:19,972
What are you, senile?

210
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,175
I'm not jumping in there.

211
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:24,577
Hey, look... coins.

212
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:28,714
(muffled shouting)

213
00:09:28,782 --> 00:09:31,050
(grunting)

214
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:36,589
(growls)

215
00:09:36,657 --> 00:09:38,424
(gun hammers cocking)

216
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,726
(gunshots)

217
00:09:40,794 --> 00:09:42,962
(gurgling)

218
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:46,566
I got 48 cents.

219
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:51,037
(gasps) There's one more
nickel, and it's a big one!

220
00:09:55,642 --> 00:09:57,743
(muffled gurgling)

221
00:10:01,048 --> 00:10:02,648
(flushing)

222
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:06,986
Quickly, into the sewer hole.

223
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:11,657
Why?
(gasps)

224
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:21,467
(shouting)

225
00:10:21,535 --> 00:10:23,069
(grunting)

226
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:27,740
What's this dump?

227
00:10:34,882 --> 00:10:36,249
Professor:
My God!

228
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:37,783
It's the Pantheon!

229
00:10:37,851 --> 00:10:40,253
LEELA:
This place is 3,000 years old.

230
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,555
What could possibly
be left to discover?

231
00:10:42,623 --> 00:10:45,524
Maybe something
about ourselves, Leela.

232
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:47,860
Wait! What's under
that blanket?

233
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:52,632
My God!
Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man!

234
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:54,533
It's truly a masterpiece.

235
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:58,838
Note how the perspective lines
draw the eye right to his dong.

236
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,974
Say, what's this?

237
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:04,777
Anyone hear something?

238
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:06,012
It's a coin slot.

239
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,681
Bender, insert
that giant nickel.

240
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:10,049
Sure.

241
00:11:10,117 --> 00:11:11,050
(laughing)

242
00:11:11,118 --> 00:11:13,219
(clanking)

243
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:14,987
Aah!

244
00:11:15,055 --> 00:11:16,222
Hush, Bender!

245
00:11:17,457 --> 00:11:20,726
What's your game,
Vitruvian Man?

246
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:28,067
Ooh!

247
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:32,605
Professor: I withdraw the
question, Vitruvian Man.

248
00:11:32,673 --> 00:11:36,008
Da Vinci's lost workshop.

249
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:37,843
At the risk of sounding stupid,

250
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:39,578
do these things actually work?

251
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:41,781
Of course not, stupid!

252
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:45,217
I mean... that flying machine's
as aerodynamic as a sofa!

253
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:47,987
How could it possibly get off
the ground?

254
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:51,157
In a way thou shalt
ne'er discover!

255
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:53,626
(all gasping)

256
00:11:53,694 --> 00:11:55,261
Hi, Animatronio.

257
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:57,363
I feign death and stalk thee,

258
00:11:57,431 --> 00:12:00,299
that I might preserve the
greatest of Leonardo's secrets.

259
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:01,367
Hee-yah!

260
00:12:05,572 --> 00:12:08,007
All right, buddy,
we want secrets.

261
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:09,809
And they better be ancient!

262
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:11,544
Porco metallico!

263
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:15,514
Ne'er shall I reveal how these
wondrous machines fit together!

264
00:12:15,582 --> 00:12:17,283
Professor:
They fit together?!

265
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:18,417
I said no such thing.

266
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:19,618
And then I died!

267
00:12:19,686 --> 00:12:20,886
(raspy screech)

268
00:12:23,824 --> 00:12:24,957
You're right, Professor.

269
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:26,525
This thing doesn't fly.

270
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:28,227
Don't sit in there, you idiot!

271
00:12:28,295 --> 00:12:29,762
That's dangerous!

272
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:35,568
Heh-wha...?

273
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:46,412
(clicking, ratcheting)

274
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:53,919
(gasps)

275
00:12:53,987 --> 00:12:56,555
No wonder this contraption
isn't aerodynamic!

276
00:12:56,623 --> 00:12:59,592
It's not an aircraft,
it's a spacecraft!

277
00:13:01,161 --> 00:13:05,264
Basta! As I live, thou shan't
discover the great secret!

278
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:14,240
FRY:
Bye, Animatronio!

279
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,034
(both grunt)

280
00:13:42,102 --> 00:13:43,436
My God!

281
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:46,138
Why would Leonardo's machine
have brought us here?

282
00:13:46,206 --> 00:13:48,874
Uh, I don't know.

283
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:51,610
I am Leonardo. guy.

284
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:52,645
(both gasp)

285
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:55,047
Welcome to Planet Vinci.

286
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:01,253
Professor:
My God!

287
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:03,055
FRY:
That's what I was gonna say!

288
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,950
<i>Professor:
Leonardo!</i>

289
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,452
You're alive?! Here?!

290
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,587
(sighs)

291
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,255
You've learned my great secret.

292
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:18,424
I was but a visitor to Earth.

293
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:22,027
In truth, I am what you call
"a space alien."

294
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:23,362
(gasps)

295
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,897
It's an honor to meet you,
Leonardo.

296
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,966
<i>And might I say, you were great
in Titanic.</i>

297
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,801
<i>The Beach... eh.</i>

298
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,104
That's Leonardo DiCaprio,
you blockhead!

299
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,405
(groans)

300
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:34,840
Heh.
Looks like eating rocks

301
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,675
wasn't as dumb as you said.

302
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,814
FRY: So what do people
do for fun here?

303
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,716
Do you enjoy partying
all night,

304
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,151
with plenty of ale
and lusty women?

305
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,152
I sure do!

306
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,654
Not us.

307
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:53,792
We spend our leisure time
in the mathematics museum.

308
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,263
Planet Vinci is basically
a single colossal university.

309
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,598
How's your football team?

310
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,599
Learned.

311
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:01,900
Ooh!

312
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:04,303
I'm going to check out
that math lecture.

313
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:08,273
All this knowledge is
giving me a raging "brainer."

314
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:11,076
Would, uh, you like to hear
the lecture, too, Fry?

315
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:14,413
No. It would just go in one ear
and our some other hole.

316
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,248
Come. Sit down.

317
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,383
Now, that I can do.

318
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,684
Ow!

319
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:22,187
I have a terrible secret
to confess, Mr. DiCaprio.

320
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,189
I'm not very smart.

321
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,158
I appreciate your candor.

322
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:29,795
I don't even know what
language you're speaking.

323
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:30,929
(sighs)

324
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:33,399
I, too, have a confession.

325
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,868
You see, here on Planet Vinci,

326
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,303
I am the stupidest person.

327
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,206
What?! Who'd possibly
think you're stupid?

328
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,841
Duh! I'm Leonardo!

329
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,310
I don't know the mass
of the Higgs boson.

330
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,913
Duh! I have
to draw in pencil,

331
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:51,550
'cause I don't know
how to use rendering software.

332
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,953
(couple laughing)

333
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,055
Stupid Biff!

334
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,289
Thinks he's so smart.

335
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,058
He looks stronger
than you, too.

336
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:03,095
I went to Earth because I could
no longer stand the ridicule.

337
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:06,632
But being surrounded
by even stupider people

338
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,500
was equally infuriating.

339
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,769
I can see myself
in your shiny button.

340
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,938
Inventing is what
makes me happy.

341
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:16,842
Or did, until I misplaced
the plans for my masterpiece.

342
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,177
You mean these?

343
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,078
(gasps)

344
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,346
The machina magnifica!

345
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,248
Oh! Infinite joy!

346
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:27,219
Fry, my friend, you have given
my life meaning again!

347
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:30,556
That calculus lecture
was harder than I expected.

348
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:34,193
We had to answer every question
in the form of an opera.

349
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,161
I have a lot of homework
for tomorrow,

350
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:40,165
if I don't want to be...
âª embarrassed. âª

351
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:44,870
(bright, lilting Renaissance
folk melody playing)

352
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,310
âª âª

353
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,789
âª âª

354
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,560
(harsh buzz)

355
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,998
(class laughing)

356
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,515
(armpit squeaking)

357
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:31,617
(catcalls, booing)

358
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,218
Thank you. Thank you.

359
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:36,054
And if you like that,
you'll love our main event.

360
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:40,359
Ladies and gentlemen...
Leonardo DiCaprio!

361
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,594
(cheering)

362
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,496
I mean DaVinci!

363
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:48,634
(booing)

364
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,670
For centuries,
you've ridiculed me.

365
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,472
Especially you, Biff.

366
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,406
Nice hat!

367
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:55,874
AUDIENCE:
Ooh!

368
00:17:55,942 --> 00:18:00,813
But, at long last, this
invention will show you.

369
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,214
'Twill show you all!

370
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:07,219
Behold, my unstoppable
doomsday machine!

371
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:08,620
And I helped!

372
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:12,291
Wait... you told me it was an
unstoppable ice cream machine.

373
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:15,027
Ice cream is just a
byproduct of the machine.

374
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,263
Its primary purpose it to
exterminate everyone

375
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:21,200
who ever made me feel inferior!

376
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,503
Ooh! I'm so scared!

377
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:27,005
Bring it on, dum-dum!

378
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:30,108
(mocking laughter)

379
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,443
Oh, yeah?

380
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:32,911
Let's see how hard
you're laughing

381
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:36,381
when my doomsday machine
chops off your face!

382
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,962
Leonardo, stop!

383
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,063
(audience gasps)

384
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,031
I want in on this!

385
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,833
Are you crazy, Professor?

386
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,568
I hate these nerds!

387
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,437
Just 'cause
I'm stupider than them,

388
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,606
they think they're
smarter than me.

389
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:04,877
Kill them all...
starting with the math teacher!

390
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:12,050
(screaming)

391
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:21,426
I knew this final invention
would be a humdinger.

392
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,794
Yes.

393
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:26,164
We three idiots will finally
have our revenge.

394
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:27,833
I don't think so.

395
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:32,304
You two make me ashamed
to call myself an idiot.

396
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:38,677
There's always going to be
someone smarter than you,

397
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:39,945
so the only way to be happy

398
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,780
is to make the most
of what you've got.

399
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,515
But you've got nothing.

400
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,583
Oh, no?

401
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,084
I've got one single nail,

402
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,353
and another nail
to nail it in with,

403
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,989
and I'm gonna stop this infernal
ice cream machine

404
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,257
once and for all.

405
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,428
Aah! Oh! Oh!

406
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,201
(groaning, screaming)

407
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,738
Oh! Oh! Ow!

408
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:14,579
(laughing)

409
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,248
Some doomsday machine!

410
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,083
It barely killed anyone!

411
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:18,951
Oh, yeah?

412
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,753
Well, take this!

413
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,657
Oh, my.

414
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,793
Poor Leonardo DaVinci.

415
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,862
He sure was stupid.

416
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:35,867
Fry, I admire what you did today

417
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:39,538
and I'm deeply sorry for
insulting your intellect...

418
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,274
Your tiny, tiny intellect.

419
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:44,443
Oops! There I go
again, you dope.

420
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,877
Uh, I mean, dummy.

421
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:47,145
It's okay.

422
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,448
I may not be clever,
but I have a good heart.

423
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,383
That's what my mom used to say.

424
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:53,452
She was a wise woman.

425
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,120
FRY: Also that I'm not
much to look at.

426
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:59,342
Professor: <i>A wise woman indeed.</i>

427
00:21:00,483 --> 00:21:02,505
I can't believe it!
I'm gonna die!

428
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:03,714
Next Thursday...

429
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:30,058
