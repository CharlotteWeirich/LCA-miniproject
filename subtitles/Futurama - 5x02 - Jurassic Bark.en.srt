for 1 2 more years after I got frozen?

310
00:19:25,013 --> 00:19:26,651
Indeed.

311
00:19:26,813 --> 00:19:28,292
Stop the cloning.

312
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:34,084
Oh, sure.
Smash the smart guy's machine.

313
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:36,170
-Fry, what's wrong?
-Think about it.

314
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:38,762
Seymour lived a full life
after I was gone.

315
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:41,288
He probably even added new songs
to his repertoire.

316
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:44,883
But that's a good thing.
"Walking on Sunshine" sucks noodles.

317
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:46,970
I had Seymour till he was 3.

318
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:49,693
That's when I knew him
and that's when I loved him.

319
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:52,811
I'll never forget him.

320
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:56,488
But he forgot me a long,
long time ago.

321
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:12,082
["I WILL WAIT FOR YOU" PLAYS]

322
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:41,612
MAN:
Ow!
