They did,
but then they made more!

You see, once the Benders
reached atomic scale,

287
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,090
they began directly manipulating
water and co2 molecules

00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,920
Well, yes, actually,
it is sort of related to that.

332
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,360
Can we talk?

333
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,930
Grabbing your spaceship
was not okay.

334
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,260
I-I lost my cool, and I'm sorry.

335
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,130
In group, I learned
that I tend to be a bit...

336
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,700
Repulsive?
(Laughs)

337
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,300
Sensitive.

338
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,910
So now I'm, like,
trying to work on my attitude,

339
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,110
and project an air
of positivity.

340
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,780
You're projecting an air
of something.

341
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,910
Phew!

342
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,880
You're so stinky, you need right
guard <i>and</i> left guard. (Laughs)

343
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,050
I'll take your hygiene advice
to heart.

344
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,620
You're ugly!

345
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,990
(Cackling)

346
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,320
(Weapons firing)

347
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,820
Hey! Ow!

348
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,590
Yo, freak show!

349
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,560
Your face has been declared
a weapon of mass disgusting.

350
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,930
(Laughs)

351
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,300
Timeless.

352
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,130
Okay, deep breath, deep breath.

353
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,840
(Inhales and exhales deeply)

354
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,570
(Weapons firing)

355
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,970
(Touch tones sounding)

356
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,740
Dr. lesterman?
(Clears throat)

357
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,910
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I think I'm close

358
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,440
to a temper-control incident.

359
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,180
Woman (Recorded):
You have reached the office

360
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,750
of Dr. Judy lesterman
and Dr. ira rothkiss.

361
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,180
The office is now closed.

362
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,650
If this is a pharmacy calling...

363
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,690
(Yelling)

364
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,630
That's it! I promised myself
I wouldn't do this, but I...

365
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,030
(Grunting)

366
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,900
I will destroy you all!

367
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,600
I won't stop until
your whole planet is as ugly

368
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,140
as you perceive me to be!

369
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,040
That will take a very long time.

370
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,740
(Laughing)

371
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,110
Okay. Stop! Stop!

372
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,540
(Grunting, people yelling)

373
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,050
(Crying)

374
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,580
Stupid...

375
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,520
(Muttering)

376
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,880
Ah.

377
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,520
Blender,

378
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,150
you're the only one who's sober.

379
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,260
(Burps)
You got to do something!

380
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,290
Haven't I done enough already?

381
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,260
Please, stop the monster.

382
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,360
Just do that one thing!

383
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,800
Make it zero, and you got a deal.
(Grunts)

384
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,670
What if I foldeded the
Professor's sweaters for you?

385
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,700
Both of them?

386
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:55,070
You mean you'll do two things,
and I only have to do one thing?

387
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,310
Yeah. Just save the world.

388
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,110
(Laughs)
Sucker.

389
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,080
(Glass breaking,
people screaming)

390
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,020
Legion of Benders, come unto me!

391
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,590
We have one thing to do.

392
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,920
Micro Benders:
Screw that!

393
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,620
Ah, come on, you lazy jerks!

394
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,290
If we all pitch in,

395
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,060
we each only have to do one
quintillionth of a thing.

396
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,200
Micro Benders (Sigh):
All right.

397
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,550
Big Bender starts right now.

398
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,790
Get a shave, ugly!

399
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,230
Oh.

400
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,000
How about some
aftershave, dumpy?

401
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,940
(Grunts)
You big bully!

402
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,540
You ugly nerd, enjoy a nice
guggenheim swirly!

403
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,850
(Spluttering)

404
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,680
(Gasps)

405
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,920
(Groaning)

406
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,920
Let this beating be a lesson

407
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,190
about never attacking those
more handsome than oneself.

408
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,590
All I wanted was to
apologize to you people.

409
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,330
But now I have to kill you.

410
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,170
How, by making me look at you?
(Laughs)

411
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,700
No. By making you
look at... my mama!

412
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,900
(Yells)

413
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,770
Your mama's so ugly!

414
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,540
I told you not to
talk about my mama!

415
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,040
(Groans)

416
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,640
(Grunting)

417
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,550
(Groaning)

418
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,930
(Whirring)

419
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,900
Robot God:
<i>Walk toward the light, Bender.</i>

420
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,230
Bender:
<i>Aw, man, do I have to walk?</i>

421
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,270
No!

422
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,070
(Cackling)

423
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,170
Huh? Huh?

424
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,850
No!

425
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,250
At last... I'm beautiful!

426
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,190
Bender:
Yeah, if you're into gray dust.

427
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,390
(Cheering shouts)

428
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,630
(Slurred):
Bender, you di' it!

429
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,000
No, <i>we</i> di' it.

430
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,970
Ladies and gentlemen,
if together we were able

431
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,370
to defeat
this giant space monster,

432
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,870
think how also
we might defeat the monsters

433
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,240
of poverty and disease
and unliteracy.

434
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,010
In this spirit,
I ask my fellow Benders

435
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,880
to join me in working
diligently to...

436
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,110
Boo!
(Grumbling)

437
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,080
Go to hell!

438
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,020
Come on, let's go someplace
where we don't have

439
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,490
to do one quintillionth
of a thing all the time.

440
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,940
Well, that was dumb.

441
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,770
(All groaning)

442
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,640
Man, were we drunk.

443
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,810
What happened, Professor?

444
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,950
Something absolutely
incredible!

445
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,050
The sweaters got folded!

446
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,550
(All gasping)
But how?

447
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,090
I didn't do it.

448
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,720
Bender, did you learn a lesson
about not being lazy

449
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,130
while the rest of us were bombed
out of our gourds?

450
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,660
Maybe I did, Fry.

451
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,330
Maybe I did.

452
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,230
Or maybe I rescued
one last mini-Bender

453
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,870
to fold stupid, ugly sweaters
while I laughed at him.

454
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,340
(Laughing)

455
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,010
I guess we'll never know.

456
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,240
(Inhales and exhales)
