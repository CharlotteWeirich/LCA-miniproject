<i>Only the Avatar can
master all four elements</i>

00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:21,864
<i>and bring balance to the world.</i>

7
00:00:28,142 --> 00:00:31,424
<i>Korra and Mako have discovered
the truth about Amon's identity.</i>

8
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:35,119
<i>He's a waterbender,
a bloodbender, and
brother to Tarrlok.</i>

9
00:00:35,357 --> 00:00:40,463
<i>Now Korra and Mako plan to
infiltrate the Equalist victory rally
and expose Amon as a fraud.</i>

10
00:00:40,585 --> 00:00:44,934
<i>Meanwhile Asami, Bolin and General Iroh
head toward Hiroshi's secret airfield</i>

11
00:00:45,158 --> 00:00:47,816
<i>where Asami intends to
take down her father.</i>

12
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:51,901
One Book: Air, Episode 12,
"Endgame"

13
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,305
I think we found
our secret airfield.

14
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:08,619
Bolin, once we get down there.

15
00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:10,838
I need you to tear up
those runways.

16
00:01:11,179 --> 00:01:12,916
We can't let those
aircraft take off.

17
00:01:13,103 --> 00:01:13,948
Oh-Yeah!, captain.

18
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:15,988
Uh!, General.
General.

19
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:20,567
All right, you guys wait here
until we get back, okay?

20
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:23,559
Stay.

21
00:01:29,937 --> 00:01:32,769
Why would there be fence
posts but no fence?

22
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:12,722
Thank you all for joining me on this historic occasion.

23
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,776
When I was a boy,

24
00:02:17,788 --> 00:02:22,504
a firebender struck down my entire
family and left me scarred.

25
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,287
That tragic event
began my quest,

26
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,589
to equalize the world.

27
00:02:28,768 --> 00:02:30,312
That's a lie, Amon.

28
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,568
Or should I call you "Noatak"?

29
00:02:37,703 --> 00:02:38,814
You want her taken out?

30
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:39,398
No.

31
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:41,883
Everyone, calm down.

32
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:44,416
We have nothing to fear
from the Avatar.

33
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:46,682
Let's hear what she has to say.

34
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:48,603
Amon has been lying to you.

35
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:52,199
The spirits didn't give him the power
to take people's bending away.

36
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:54,530
He uses bloodbending to do it.

37
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:56,668
Amon is a waterbender.

38
00:02:59,816 --> 00:03:01,182
What is this nonsense?

39
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:03,093
You're desperate, Avatar.

40
00:03:03,103 --> 00:03:06,457
Making up stories about me
is a pathetic last resort.

41
00:03:06,734 --> 00:03:09,007
Your family wasn't killed
by a firebender.

44
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:13,771
is councilman Tarrlok.

45
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:17,748
An amusing tale.

46
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,537
But I will show you the truth.

47
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:37,195
This is what a firebender
did to me.

48
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:38,111
What?

49
00:03:39,538 --> 00:03:41,049
The Avatar is lying!

50
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:43,190
I'm telling you he's a waterbender.

51
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:45,822
They don't believe me.

52
00:03:46,363 --> 00:03:48,334
- It didn't work.
- We said what we had to.

53
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:49,308
Let's get out of here.

54
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:54,732
I wouldn't leave yet Avatar.

55
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,618
You'll miss the main event.

56
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:07,975
No.

57
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:09,547
They got away.

58
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:12,323
We saw them get away.

59
00:04:15,485 --> 00:04:16,182
Asami.

60
00:04:18,106 --> 00:04:19,849
Asami, I know I have hurt you

61
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:21,646
and I am sorry.

62
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:26,630
But I believe that one day you
will come to your senses and
we can be a family again.

63
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:27,663
Are you insane?

64
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:30,468
How can we be a family after
everything you've done?

65
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,008
Mom would hate you for
what you've become.

66
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:34,583
How dare you!

67
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,894
I am avenging her death!

68
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:39,679
The airplanes are ready
for takeoff, sir.

69
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:40,254
Good.

70
00:04:40,373 --> 00:04:41,547
Annihilate the fleet.

71
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:44,817
That's right, general.

72
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,185
I intercepted your message
to Commander Bumi.

73
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:50,502
I know exactly,

74
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:51,817
where they're hiding.

75
00:04:54,654 --> 00:04:56,096
How are we gonna
get out of here?

76
00:04:56,617 --> 00:04:58,640
I don't suppose you know
how to metalbend?

77
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,069
That is a negative, sir.

78
00:05:07,403 --> 00:05:09,366
Naga!,
over here.

79
00:05:18,774 --> 00:05:19,939
Who needs a metalbender?

80
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,572
We got naga!,
Yeah!

81
00:05:26,484 --> 00:05:28,214
I'm going after
those airplanes.

82
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:30,118
No, Naga!

83
00:05:40,238 --> 00:05:43,184
What do you know. Just like
a future industries forklift.

84
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:08,982
Tonight, I rid the world
of airbending,

85
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:10,245
Forever.

86
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:12,123
Amon, let them go.

87
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:15,444
You're welcome to come down
here and try to stop me.

88
00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:17,028
He's trying to bait you.

89
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:18,808
I don't care.
We have to save them.

90
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:23,484
The Avatar needs to be reminded
of the power I possess.

91
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,812
Where are Pema and the baby?

92
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:44,647
In prison.

93
00:06:44,676 --> 00:06:45,320
Beifong?

94
00:06:45,346 --> 00:06:45,969
I don't know.

95
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:00,441
Follow me, kids.

96
00:07:07,684 --> 00:07:09,574
Get them out of here.
We'll create a diversion.

97
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:11,288
Let's go get your mother
and the baby.

98
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:13,109
Prison break!

99
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,300
Let her go!

100
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:33,739
No!

101
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:34,615
Korra!

102
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:49,639
I told you
I would destroy you.

103
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:23,175
Thanks for
looking out for me, aang.

104
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:49,290
Thanks!,
Naga.

105
00:10:56,883 --> 00:10:57,647
Asami!

106
00:10:59,444 --> 00:11:00,627
What do you think
you're doing?

107
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:04,309
You are aiding the very people
who took your mother away!

108
00:11:04,776 --> 00:11:07,005
You don't feel love
for mom anymore.

109
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:08,805
You're too full of hatred.

110
00:11:09,308 --> 00:11:12,849
You ungrateful
insolent child.

111
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:35,690
I now see there is no
chance to save you!

112
00:11:42,557 --> 00:11:45,646
Mr. sato, you are
a horrible father!

113
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:10,833
You really are
a horrible father.

114
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:27,608
Finally,

115
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,845
you are powerless.

116
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:38,598
Amon!

117
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:43,543
Everything the Avatar said
is true, isn't it?

118
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:46,267
I just saw you bloodbend her.

119
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:57,159
You traitor.
I dedicated my life to you.

120
00:13:07,171 --> 00:13:08,844
You served me well
Lieutenant.

121
00:13:48,315 --> 00:13:48,969
Mako.

122
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:50,884
My bending,

123
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:52,204
Everything will be all right.

124
00:13:52,325 --> 00:13:53,457
We just need to
get out of here.

125
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:04,622
I'm impressed.

126
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,420
No one has ever gotten the
better of me like that.

127
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:14,502
It is almost a shame to take the
bending of someone so talented.

128
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:16,355
Almost.

129
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,424
No!

130
00:14:29,504 --> 00:14:30,603
Impossible.

131
00:14:31,777 --> 00:14:33,903
I-I can airbend?

132
00:14:35,203 --> 00:14:36,446
I can airbend!

133
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:53,465
No,

134
00:14:53,825 --> 00:14:55,692
You... Don't!

135
00:15:02,472 --> 00:15:03,403
Did you see what happened?

136
00:15:03,575 --> 00:15:04,181
No.

137
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,006
Who was that?

138
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:09,935
Can you see him?

139
00:15:12,504 --> 00:15:13,281
Could that be...?

140
00:15:14,342 --> 00:15:17,637
- You bending tyrant!
- Evil Avatar!

141
00:15:17,638 --> 00:15:19,155
What did you do to our
leader?

142
00:15:33,978 --> 00:15:35,509
- He's waterbending.
- What?

143
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,340
- He is a bender!
- The scar is fake!

144
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:38,986
The Avatar
was telling the truth!

145
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,346
Noatak.

146
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,026
It's over, brother.

147
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:18,084
I'm sorry for what
I had to do to you.

148
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:21,274
Our father set us
on this path.

149
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:23,487
Fate caused us to collide.

150
00:16:24,102 --> 00:16:26,169
I should have left with you
when we were boys.

151
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:29,669
Leave with me now.

152
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:33,800
We have a second chance.
We can start over together.

153
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:37,404
Please, you're all I have left
in the world.

154
00:16:46,035 --> 00:16:48,106
I can't believe
Amon got you too.

155
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,105
Hey, at least you unlocked
your airbending.

156
00:16:52,918 --> 00:16:54,241
Bro, not the time.

157
00:16:54,654 --> 00:16:55,638
Right, right.

158
00:16:56,129 --> 00:16:57,048
I'll just stand over here.

159
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:00,009
Quietly,
In silence.

160
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:08,609
You saved Republic city.

161
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:10,411
But Amon got away.

162
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,301
Yay!, Uncle Bumi's here!

163
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:21,400
Great.

164
00:17:21,401 --> 00:17:23,387
Now I have
to entertain my brother.

165
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:36,755
The two of us
together again.

166
00:17:37,032 --> 00:17:38,800
There's nothing we can't do.

167
00:17:39,209 --> 00:17:40,413
Yes, Noatak.

168
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:42,273
Noatak...,

169
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:45,808
I'd almost forgotten
the sound of my own name.

170
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:05,721
It will be just like the
good old days.

171
00:18:39,406 --> 00:18:41,789
I've tried everything
in my power

172
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:44,972
but, I cannot restore
Korra's bending.

173
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:49,062
But you're the best healer
in the world.

174
00:18:49,204 --> 00:18:50,594
You have to keep trying!

175
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:53,116
I'm sorry, There's
nothing else I can do.

176
00:18:53,527 --> 00:18:55,104
Korra can still airbend,

177
00:18:55,408 --> 00:18:58,472
but her connection to the other
elements has been severed.

178
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,282
It's going to be all right, Korra.

179
00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:10,607
No,

180
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:12,115
it's not.

181
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:28,358
Korra!,
Wait.

182
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:32,005
Go away.

183
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:33,407
I will,

184
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:36,348
but I just want you to know,
I'm here for you.

185
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:40,480
No, I mean go away
back to Republic city.

186
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:42,205
Get on with your life.

187
00:19:42,888 --> 00:19:44,169
What are you talking about?

188
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,835
I'm not the Avatar anymore.

189
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,920
You don't need to
do me any favors.

190
00:19:49,475 --> 00:19:52,224
I don't care if you're
the Avatar or not.

191
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:53,781
Listen.

192
00:19:54,574 --> 00:19:58,623
When Tarrlok took you I was
losing my mind at the thought
of never seeing you again.

193
00:19:59,276 --> 00:20:00,164
I realized.

194
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,102
I love you, Korra.

195
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:06,546
I...
I can't.

196
00:20:07,015 --> 00:20:07,753
Korra!

197
00:20:17,474 --> 00:20:18,928
We need to be patient with her.

198
00:20:19,527 --> 00:20:22,129
It will take time for her to accept
what has happened.

199
00:21:04,274 --> 00:21:05,483
Not now, Tenzin.

200
00:21:05,871 --> 00:21:07,462
I just want to be left alone.

201
00:21:07,827 --> 00:21:09,241
But you called me here.

202
00:21:11,942 --> 00:21:12,677
Aang.

203
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,155
You have finally connected
with your spiritual self.

204
00:21:16,747 --> 00:21:17,472
How?

205
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:19,405
When he hit our lowest point,

206
00:21:19,617 --> 00:21:21,836
we are open to the greatest change.

207
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:22,648
I love you too.

208
00:23:07,614 --> 00:23:08,154
Thank you.

209
00:23:11,241 --> 00:23:12,870
I am so proud of you

210
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:14,685
Avatar Korra.
