1
00:00:00,751 --> 00:00:01,968
Earth.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,803
Fire.

3
00:00:03,805 --> 00:00:05,671
Air.

4
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,840
Water.

5
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:11,594
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:14,513
and bring balance to the world.

7

<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

8
00:00:20,272 --> 00:00:22,188
Is there any place safe
for the Avatar?

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,024
First, President Raiko
banished her from Republic City.

10
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:27,360
Then the earth queen declared
her an enemy of the kingdom

11
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:30,363
after Korra rescued a group
of airbenders from Ba Sing Se.

12
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:32,248
And now Korra
has learned that Zaheer

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,749
and his fellow criminals
are after her.

14
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:35,835
With Tenzin busy bringing
the new recruits

15
00:00:35,837 --> 00:00:37,203
to the northern air temple,

16
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:39,705
Korra's protection now rests
in Beifong's hands.

17
00:00:40,726 --> 00:00:44,154
_
_

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,191
While you're playing fetch,

19
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:00,977
four of the most dangerous
criminals in the world

20
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:02,895
are hunting you down.
We should get moving.

21
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:04,864
Relax.
We just got here.

22
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:07,650
Besides, no one knows
where I am right now except us.

23
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,372
I think she wants you
to throw it for her.

24
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:17,668
I'll pass.
Thanks.

25
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,170
We just got a call on the
radio about another airbender.

26
00:01:20,172 --> 00:01:21,838
Finally.
Where are they?

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,258
A city called Zaofu,
the home of the metal clan.

28
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,676
You know the place?

29
00:01:25,678 --> 00:01:28,962
Uh, never been, but
I don't want you going there.

30
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:32,415
I'd rest a lot easier if you
were back safe in Republic City.

31
00:01:54,686 --> 00:01:56,486
Wow, wow, wow!

32
00:01:56,488 --> 00:01:59,239
An entire city made of metal, whoo!

33
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:00,824
You should be right at home, Beifong.

34
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:02,776
Hmm.

35
00:02:22,547 --> 00:02:25,882
Yeah!

36
00:02:25,884 --> 00:02:28,719
- Aren't you coming?
- What's there to see?

37
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:30,354
It's metal. Big whoop.

38
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:32,306
Just find the airbender,
and let's get moving.

39
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:34,141
And don't tell anyone I'm here.

40
00:02:34,143 --> 00:02:35,392
Why not?

41
00:02:35,394 --> 00:02:37,227
I don't need to explain myself to you.

42
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:38,812
Just do what I say.

43
00:02:38,814 --> 00:02:42,733
Fine. You got it, chief cranky pants.

44
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:50,741
Avatar Korra, it is an honor to meet you.

45
00:02:50,743 --> 00:02:52,125
My name is Aiwei.

46
00:02:52,127 --> 00:02:55,879
- Thanks for having us.
- Is this everyone?

47
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:59,583
Yep, just us.
So can I meet the new airbender?

48
00:02:59,585 --> 00:03:01,802
Of course. Right this way.

49
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:17,434
And this is the air acolyte dining hall,

50
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:19,736
where everyone eats, and this is Daw.

51
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:21,605
He's a new airbender too, like you guys.

52
00:03:21,607 --> 00:03:23,940
It's so nice to meet you.

53
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:26,026
How exciting. New friends.

54
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:27,778
Excuse me, hello?

55
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,579
My name is Yorru.

56
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:31,948
I heard this was the place to
come if you're a new airbender.

57
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,751
You got that right, stranger.

58
00:03:34,753 --> 00:03:36,286
Well, a couple of weeks ago,

59
00:03:36,288 --> 00:03:40,257
I woke up, and suddenly, I could do this.

60
00:03:41,376 --> 00:03:44,544
Mom, Aunt Kya, we got another one!

61
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:07,734
That statue honors the first metalbender,

62
00:04:07,736 --> 00:04:10,404
Toph Beifong, who expanded

63
00:04:10,406 --> 00:04:12,873
the possibilities of what
benders were capable of.

64
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,792
Here, everyone is encouraged

65
00:04:15,794 --> 00:04:18,662
to reach his or her highest potential.

66
00:04:18,664 --> 00:04:21,164
Does Toph live here?

67
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,000
Are we gonna get to meet her?
I'm afraid not.

68
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:26,336
She used to visit from time to time,

69
00:04:26,338 --> 00:04:29,172
but years ago, she left to wander the world

70
00:04:29,174 --> 00:04:31,007
in search of enlightenment.

71
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:33,427
No one has seen her since.

72
00:04:49,694 --> 00:04:52,529
Wow, is this where the airbender lives?

73
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:56,700
Yes, but first,
her mother wants to meet you.

74
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:05,470
Is this some kind of combat training?

75
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,672
Not exactly.

76
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,642
They are rehearsing for a
dance premiere next month.

77
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:22,937
That's it for today, everyone.

78
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:24,856
Allow me to introduce

79
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,442
the matriarch of the metal clan, Suyin.

80
00:05:27,444 --> 00:05:29,027
Please, call me Su.

81
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,196
Great to finally meet you, Avatar Korra.

82
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:34,699
And this must be Mako, Bolin, and Asami.

83
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,201
You've done your research.

84
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,870
I make it my business to
know who's visiting my city.

85
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,038
So you're a dancer?

86
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,874
Dancer, leader, wife, mother,

87
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,542
collector of rare meteorites.

88
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:48,546
You'll find people here have
many skills and interests.

89
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,883
Korra, why did you lie

90
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,635
when Aiwei asked if there
was anyone else with you?

91
00:05:53,637 --> 00:05:56,221
What? I-I didn't.

92
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,939
I mean...

93
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:58,940
How did you know I was lying?

94
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,892
I am a truth seer.

95
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:02,143
When people lie,

96
00:06:02,145 --> 00:06:04,813
their heart rate and breathing increase.

97
00:06:04,815 --> 00:06:08,366
I can sense the most subtle of changes.

98
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,953
Thanks to Aiwei,
there are no secrets in our city.

99
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,739
We came with Republic
City's chief of police.

100
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,075
She didn't want anyone to know she was here.

101
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,576
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

102
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:22,080
Lin's here? Well, I would love to say hello.

103
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,165
Wait, you two know each other?

104
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:27,502
You're joking, right?

105
00:06:27,504 --> 00:06:29,921
Oh, lin never told you about me.

106
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,756
No. Why would she?

107
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:35,343
I'm Lin's sister.

108
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,015
I found out why you were
so against coming here.

109
00:06:41,017 --> 00:06:43,017
Why didn't you ever tell
me you had a sister?

110
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:44,686
Half-sister.

111
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:46,237
Same mom, different dads.

112
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,189
So what? We're blood, lin.

113
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:51,242
And after 30 years,
the least you could do is say hello.

114
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,162
I have nothing to say to you.

115
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:01,419
You two haven't spoken in 30 years...
how come?

116
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,955
Ask her. I've tried.

117
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,389
Oh, don't put that on me.

118
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,125
You're the one who tore our family apart.

119
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,727
And you've done a bang-up
job keeping it that way.

120
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,829
You haven't changed one bit, have you?

121
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,565
Look, we can stand here
arguing about the past all day,

122
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,868
but that's not the reason
the Avatar came here.

123
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,637
My daughter is thrilled to meet you.

124
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,440
Lin, your niece is the new airbender.

125
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,941
Isn't that amazing?

126
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,145
Yeah. Terrific.

127
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:30,231
Those are my two youngest, Wei and Wing.

128
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:32,066
They're playing a game called power disc.

129
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:34,152
They invented it all on their own.

130
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:37,071
Yah!

131
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,660
Oh, nice power, Wei.

132
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,663
Ha! Wing goes down.

133
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,633
I'm so proud of those two.

134
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:07,652
Huan,
I want you to meet the Avatar and her friends

135
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,020
and your aunt lin.

136
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,656
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

137
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,693
Wow, that's a really nice... Banana?

138
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,612
Yes, very, very lifelike.

139
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:20,865
It's not a banana!

140
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,700
I was inspired by harmonic convergence.

141
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:26,704
It represents the dawning of a new age,
obviously.

142
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,373
Oh, yeah, no, I c... I can totally see that.

143
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,792
I... wait, let me stand here.
Yes, I can see that now.

144
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:33,177
Yes. Thank you.

145
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,547
Banana.
I mean, that's a banana, right?

146
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:41,185
And this is my daughter Opal.

147
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:43,721
Wow, Avatar Korra.

148
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,890
I can't believe you're really here.

149
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,558
You are so amazing.

150
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,060
It's great to meet you, Opal.

151
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,445
Opal? That's a beautiful name.

152
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,731
- Thanks.
- I'm Bolin.

153
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,400
Opal, but, uh, you already knew that.

154
00:08:59,955 --> 00:09:01,405
Great. We found the airbender.

155
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,157
Let's take her back to the
airship and get out of here.

156
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,626
And the woman apparently
trying to abduct you

157
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,044
is your aunt Lin.

158
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,580
Really? I've always wanted to meet you.

159
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,333
My mom has told me so
many stories about you.

160
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:14,001
I'm sure she has.

161
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:15,887
So I've set all of you up in the guesthouses

162
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,171
while Korra trains opal.

163
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:19,340
Oh, I'm sorry, but I was hoping

164
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:21,008
she could train with the
rest of the airbenders

165
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,310
at the northern temple.

166
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,428
- That sounds amazing.
- Nonsense.

167
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,314
This is where opal's home and family are.

168
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,648
You can train her here.

169
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,317
I guess I could help her get started.

170
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,235
Absolutely not. We're leaving.

171
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,653
She's just a little worried

172
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,022
because there are a bunch
of crazy criminals after me.

173
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:37,275
If you're concerned about security,
don't be.

174
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,944
This is the safest city in the world.

175
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,363
Now, I'll see you all at dinner,
and come hungry.

176
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:45,833
My chef will blow the taste
buds right out of your mouth.

177
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:49,203
Why do you have such a
problem with your sister?

178
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:51,455
She seems nice.

179
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,624
Come on, we can stay a little while.

180
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:59,347
Okay, let's see what you got.

181
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,717
- I'm not very good.
- That's okay.

182
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:04,218
I've never been a teacher before,

183
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,137
so we're in the same boat.

184
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,888
You wanna keep your elbows in,

185
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,893
torso straight,
feet just skimming the ground.

186
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:16,364
Why don't you try it with me?

187
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:33,581
Wow, you're a natural.

188
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,665
You really think so?

189
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,584
Thanks.

190
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,347
You call yourself an airbender?

191
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:53,017
Disgraceful!

192
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,990
Be the leaf!

193
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,909
But I don't know what that means!

194
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:18,342
Now that man's a leaf.

195
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,712
The student is only as good as his master.

196
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:24,966
Great news.

197
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:26,684
I just got a message from Tenzin.

198
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,436
He's with a whole group of other airbenders

199
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,022
at the northern temple,
and he wants all of you to join them.

200
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,189
We leave first thing in the morning.

201
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,109
And the Avatar is with them?

202
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,645
No,
apparently she had to split off from Tenzin.

203
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:40,231
That's unfortunate.

204
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:43,317
I was really looking forward to meeting her.

205
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:54,495
Tonight, for your dining pleasure,

206
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:57,498
I present a seared wild Kyoshi elephant koi,

207
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,801
paired with a ginger-infused pea tendril

208
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,920
and hibiscus root salad.

209
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,839
Stunning.

210
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,095
Sorry, dear, I'm going to have
to take dinner in my office.

211
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:14,181
I just had a major breakthrough
on the tram station remodel.

212
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:16,767
Well,
don't let me stand in the way of inspiration.

213
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,319
You're the best.

214
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,938
That was my brilliant architect of a husband,
Baatar,

215
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,156
and our oldest son.

216
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,358
He engineers all my husband's projects.

217
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,527
Five kids. What a nightmare.

218
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:28,696
No, no, my children are a blessing.

219
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:30,281
Yeah, mom used to say that too,

220
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:33,751
but she never meant it.

221
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,202
Mmm.

222
00:12:35,204 --> 00:12:37,204
I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical

223
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:39,290
when he said "pea tendril..."

224
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,708
But this is delicious!

225
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,793
I know, right?

226
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,129
I don't think I've ever
had a bad meal in my life.

227
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,630
Oh, I had plenty

228
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,349
when Mako and I were living on the streets.

229
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:52,186
I mean, you'd be surprised how
bad food from a dumpster can be.

230
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,138
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

231
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,273
No, it's okay, it's okay.
That's all in the past.

232
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,525
Things are great now.

233
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,776
I got to be a pro bender,

234
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,478
fought against a dangerous revolution,

235
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,613
became a mover star,

236
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,616
and now I'm helping the
Avatar rebuild a whole nation.

237
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,069
Wow, your life sounds so exciting.

238
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:11,539
How's your search for
the new airbenders going?

239
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,824
Honestly, not great.

240
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,243
We had to rescue a whole group
of them from the earth queen.

241
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:17,912
Oh, she's horrible.

242
00:13:17,914 --> 00:13:19,747
She thinks she can just
do whatever she wants.

243
00:13:19,749 --> 00:13:21,715
- Sounds familiar.
- What?

244
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:22,833
Nothing.

245
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,585
I mean, the idea of even having a queen

246
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:27,004
is so outdated... don't you agree, Korra?

247
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,840
I haven't really thought about it too much.

248
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,926
Well, you should start.

249
00:13:31,928 --> 00:13:33,511
The world is evolving, and the earth queen

250
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,479
can evolve with it or step aside.

251
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,064
Hey, everyone,

252
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,600
my little sister is an
expert on world affairs now.

253
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:41,569
You wanna talk about
what's really bugging you?

254
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,687
Because I'm right here.

255
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,692
Sorry we're late, everyone.

256
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:52,029
Varrick!

257
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,115
- What are you doing here?
- Great question, Asami.

258
00:13:55,117 --> 00:13:58,169
I mean, what are any of us doing here?

259
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,171
Wow. Food for thought.

260
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,789
Anyhoo, how's our company doing?

261
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,374
You mean my company?

262
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,376
Future industries reverted back to me

263
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,711
after you plotted to abduct the president.

264
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:10,598
Allegedly plotted to abduct the president.

265
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,882
Never convicted.

266
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,051
Uh, that's because you escaped prison.

267
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:17,938
No, the universe decided to set me free.

268
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,391
So I looked up my old friend Suyin here,

269
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,393
pitched her a few ideas, and bam!

270
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:23,811
We're in business together.

271
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:26,313
Varrick's heading up my
new technology division.

272
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:31,235
I've seen the future,
and the future is magnets!

273
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,736
I'm working on a high-speed rail

274
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,288
that'll revolutionize transportation

275
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,073
and shipping as we know it.

276
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,458
But that's not all! I'm...

277
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,492
all right, enough!

278
00:14:38,494 --> 00:14:40,211
I'm trying to keep the Avatar safe,

279
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,245
and you're harboring a criminal?

280
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,580
Ease up, lin.

281
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:45,332
Sure,
Varrick's made a few mistakes in his past,

282
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:48,219
but that doesn't mean he should
pay for it the rest of his life.

283
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,555
My chef was a pirate,
but now he's a culinary master.

284
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,756
People change.

285
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,593
You haven't.

286
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,144
Lin!

287
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,473
So you and opal seemed
to hit it off at dinner.

288
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:07,941
I think she's really into you.

289
00:15:07,943 --> 00:15:11,945
Yeah, you know,
she's sweet and pretty and super nice.

290
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:13,179
Too bad she's not my type.

291
00:15:13,181 --> 00:15:15,148
Right, I forgot.

292
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:18,618
Your type is dumb mover
star or psycho ice princess.

293
00:15:20,122 --> 00:15:22,872
You know, that hurts a little bit.

294
00:15:22,874 --> 00:15:25,825
Right... Here.

295
00:15:29,797 --> 00:15:32,832
But maybe you're right, bro.

296
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:35,051
Maybe opal is Bolin material.

297
00:15:35,053 --> 00:15:37,837
Thanks. Yeah!

298
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:44,094
You know, before I built this city,

299
00:15:44,096 --> 00:15:45,145
there was nothing here.

300
00:15:45,147 --> 00:15:47,764
I wanted to make my mark on the world.

301
00:15:47,766 --> 00:15:49,682
It's amazing.

302
00:15:49,684 --> 00:15:51,518
Thank you for being so welcoming,

303
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,270
and I'm sorry for how Lin's been acting.

304
00:15:54,272 --> 00:15:57,857
Can I ask, what happened with you two?

305
00:15:57,859 --> 00:15:59,325
It's complicated.

306
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:01,694
We didn't have a normal childhood.

307
00:16:01,696 --> 00:16:03,363
Neither of us knew our fathers,

308
00:16:03,365 --> 00:16:06,699
and Toph was always busy
being chief of police.

309
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:09,252
Because mom grew up in such a strict house,

310
00:16:09,254 --> 00:16:11,371
she gave us all the freedom in the world,

311
00:16:11,373 --> 00:16:14,124
hoping we'd figure out our own paths.

312
00:16:14,126 --> 00:16:15,375
That sounds like a good thing.

313
00:16:15,377 --> 00:16:17,544
And in a way, it was.

314
00:16:17,546 --> 00:16:20,513
But we both ended up
fighting for mom's attention.

315
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:24,050
Lin followed in her
footsteps and became a cop.

316
00:16:24,052 --> 00:16:26,302
I was more of a rebel.

317
00:16:26,304 --> 00:16:29,522
Mom wasn't too happy with
how either of us turned out.

318
00:16:29,524 --> 00:16:32,976
When I was 16,
I left home to explore the world.

319
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:35,478
I sailed the seas on a pirate ship,

320
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,647
joined a traveling circus for while,

321
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:40,533
and lived in a sandbender
commune in the desert.

322
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:44,070
It took me a while, but I finally realized

323
00:16:44,072 --> 00:16:46,406
what I was looking for was a family.

324
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:48,324
So I bought this plot of land,

325
00:16:48,326 --> 00:16:51,244
found a brilliant architect
who later became my husband,

326
00:16:51,246 --> 00:16:53,913
and created a place I could truly call home.

327
00:16:53,915 --> 00:16:56,332
It sounds like you've created
the perfect life here.

328
00:16:56,334 --> 00:16:57,834
Almost.

329
00:16:57,836 --> 00:16:59,502
I've always wanted lin to be a part of it,

330
00:16:59,504 --> 00:17:03,089
but I gave up hope long ago
of her ever coming around.

331
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:16,486
Hey, little lady.

332
00:17:16,488 --> 00:17:21,574
Wow, you're really blowing
me away with your airbending.

333
00:17:25,614 --> 00:17:28,114
Why are you acting weird?

334
00:17:28,116 --> 00:17:29,916
Why are you acting weird?

335
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:33,753
I don't like how you're talking to me.

336
00:17:33,755 --> 00:17:35,288
Look, I'm sorry.

337
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,957
I just get really self-conscious
when I know a girl likes me,

338
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:39,926
and I end up acting stupid.

339
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:41,761
Who said I liked you?

340
00:17:41,763 --> 00:17:45,098
Oh, no! But I thought... Mako said...

341
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,850
just kidding.

342
00:17:46,852 --> 00:17:49,686
But do me a favor and stop trying.

343
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:51,804
Well, don't stop trying.

344
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:55,058
Just stop trying so much. Just be yourself.

345
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,944
Huh, be myself.

346
00:17:57,946 --> 00:18:00,697
Yeah, I guess I could give that a shot.

347
00:18:05,737 --> 00:18:06,903
Oh, hey, Korra.

348
00:18:06,905 --> 00:18:09,322
Can I steal you away
from Bolin for a minute?

349
00:18:09,324 --> 00:18:11,991
I need your help with something.

350
00:18:32,263 --> 00:18:34,397
"Let go your earthly tether.

351
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:35,848
"Enter the void.

352
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,518
Empty and become wind."

353
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,236
What are you doing?

354
00:18:40,238 --> 00:18:42,605
No one's allowed in
daddy's study except daddy.

355
00:18:42,607 --> 00:18:46,025
I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep.

356
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:48,278
What were you reading?

357
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,863
A poem by Guru Laghima,

358
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:54,200
the wisest airbender who ever lived.

359
00:18:56,204 --> 00:18:59,255
Ikki, you should be in bed.

360
00:18:59,257 --> 00:19:00,673
Come on.

361
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:04,210
- Night.
- Good night.

362
00:19:04,212 --> 00:19:07,263
You seem to know a lot
about airbender history

363
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:09,132
for someone who just got airbending.

364
00:19:09,134 --> 00:19:11,551
I've always admired the culture.

365
00:19:11,553 --> 00:19:14,187
And you moved through
those gates like a natural.

366
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:15,555
Where did you say you were from?

367
00:19:15,557 --> 00:19:17,607
A small village up north.

368
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:21,694
You've probably never heard of it.

369
00:19:21,696 --> 00:19:22,696
Wait.

370
00:19:22,697 --> 00:19:24,614
Zaheer!

371
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:37,744
I need some help!

372
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,099
Hold it right there!

373
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:26,125
Sorry I won't be joining you
at the northern air temple.

374
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:29,095
I'm afraid I have other plans.

375
00:20:37,805 --> 00:20:40,940
Who is it?

376
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:42,141
Hey, it's me.

377
00:20:42,143 --> 00:20:45,895
I brought someone who wants to talk to you.

378
00:20:47,031 --> 00:20:50,066
You wanna talk, then talk.

379
00:20:50,068 --> 00:20:53,236
I'm sorry being here has
been so hard for you.

380
00:20:53,238 --> 00:20:56,823
When you showed up,
I was so excited to get to know you.

381
00:20:56,825 --> 00:20:58,991
I'd heard so many great things about you

382
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:00,793
from mom and grandma Toph.

383
00:21:00,795 --> 00:21:03,663
So I guess I was kind of sad

384
00:21:03,665 --> 00:21:06,916
that you didn't wanna get to know me.

385
00:21:08,385 --> 00:21:11,337
Believe me,
I know my family can be a little crazy

386
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:13,339
and overwhelming sometimes,

387
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:18,761
but I would love it so much
if you would be a part of it.

388
00:21:18,763 --> 00:21:21,097
Get out.

389
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:23,766
Sorry. Did I say something wrong?

390
00:21:23,768 --> 00:21:25,852
Get out!

391
00:21:31,442 --> 00:21:32,775
What's your problem?

392
00:21:32,777 --> 00:21:34,193
Don't get mad at Opal.

393
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:35,661
I asked her to talk to you

394
00:21:35,663 --> 00:21:36,863
because I thought it would help you

395
00:21:36,865 --> 00:21:38,865
snap out of whatever funk you're in,

396
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:40,116
but I guess I was wrong.

397
00:21:40,118 --> 00:21:41,951
Why don't you focus on fixing the world

398
00:21:41,953 --> 00:21:43,953
and stop trying to fix my family?

399
00:21:43,955 --> 00:21:47,507
Su's right. You're never gonna change.

400
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:50,543
You're always gonna be a bitter,
lonely woman.

401
