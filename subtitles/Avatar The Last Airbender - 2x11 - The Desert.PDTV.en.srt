00:00:01,784 --> 00:00:03,576
Water

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,576
Earth

3
00:00:06,036 --> 00:00:07,376
Fire

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,784
Air

5
00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:14,262
Long ago,the four nations lived together in harmony

6
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:17,790
then everything changed when the fire nation attacked

7
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:23,149
Only the avatar mastered all four elements could stop them

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,761
but when the world needed him most he vanished

9
00:00:27,383 --> 00:00:30,472
100 years passed, my brother and I discovered the new avatar

10
00:00:30,682 --> 00:00:32,493
an airbender named Aang

11
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:35,917
And although his airbending skill is great,

12
00:00:36,187 --> 00:00:38,606
he has a lot to learn before he is ready to save anyone.

13
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:41,839
but I believe...
...Aang can save the world

14
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:49,700
Previously on
Avatar...

15
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,685
The Avatar has kidnapped my daughter.

16
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:58,308
I want you to do whatever it takes to bring her home.

17
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:06,713
Sandbenders! Shoo! Away from the bison!

18
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:08,033
Library's sinking!

19
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,144
Library's sinking!

20
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:18,493
No!

21
00:01:18,885 --> 00:01:20,387
I'm sorry Appa.

22
00:01:20,594 --> 00:01:21,711
Where's Appa?

23
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:32,627
Book Two: Earth
Chapter Eleven: The Desert

24
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,627
How could you let them take Appa? Why didn't you stop them?

25
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:49,818
I couldn't! The library was sinking! You guys were still inside and...

26
00:01:49,627 --> 00:01:52,627
You could have come to get us! I could have saved him!

27
00:01:52,627 --> 00:01:55,127
I can hardly feel any vibrations out here.

28
00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:58,039
The sandbenders snuck up on me and there wasn't time for...

29
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,470
You just didn't care! You never liked Appa! You wanted him gone!

30
00:02:01,627 --> 00:02:06,127
Aang, stop it. You know Toph did all she could. She saved our lives.

31
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,627
Who's going to save our lives now? We'll never make it out of here.

32
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:12,627
That's all any of you guys care about yourselves!

33
00:02:12,627 --> 00:02:15,427
You don't care whether Appa is okay or not!

34
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:19,127
We're all concerned, but we can't afford to be fighting now.

35
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:21,527
I'm going after Appa.

36
00:02:22,627 --> 00:02:24,127
Aang, wait!

37
00:02:26,627 --> 00:02:30,627
We'd better start walking. We're the only people who know about the solar eclipse.

38
00:02:30,627 --> 00:02:33,627
We have to get that information to Ba Sing Se.

39
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:38,127
You think if we dig out the giant owl, he'll give us a ride?

40
00:02:46,627 --> 00:02:47,627
Maybe we should make camp.

41
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:51,528
No, please, don't stop just for me!

42
00:03:03,127 --> 00:03:05,127
What now?

43
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:17,627
Colonel Mongke! What a pleasant surprise!

44
00:03:18,127 --> 00:03:22,627
If you're surprised we're here then the Dragon of the West has lost a few steps.

45
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:30,627
You know these guys?

46
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:36,127
Sure. Colonel Mongke and the Rough Riders are legendary.

47
00:03:36,627 --> 00:03:39,627
Each one is a different kind of weapons specialist.

48
00:03:39,627 --> 00:03:43,627
They are also a very capable singing group.

49
00:03:44,127 --> 00:03:48,127
We're not here to give a concert. We're here to apprehend fugitives!

50
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:54,127
Would you like some tea first? I'd love some. How about you, Kachi?

51
00:03:54,127 --> 00:03:58,569
I make you as a jasmine man. Am I right?

52
00:03:58,627 --> 00:04:01,229
Enough stalling! Round 'em up!

53
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:44,127
It's nice to see old friends.

54
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:47,127
Too bad you don't have any old friends that don't want to attack you.

55
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:52,127
Hmm... Old friends that don't want to attack me...

56
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:06,627
Can't you watch where you're...

57
00:05:06,627 --> 00:05:07,627
No.

58
00:05:07,627 --> 00:05:09,127
Right. Sorry.

59
00:05:09,127 --> 00:05:11,127
Come on guys, we've got to stick together.

60
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,127
If I sweat any more, I don't think sticking together will be a problem.

61
00:05:15,127 --> 00:05:17,595
Katara, can I have some water?

62
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:20,503
Okay, but we've got to try to conserve it.

63
00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:27,352
We're drinking your bending water?

64
00:05:29,627 --> 00:05:31,627
You used this on the swamp guy!

65
00:05:32,627 --> 00:05:34,127
It does taste swampy.

66
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,336
I'm sorry, it's all we have.

67
00:05:39,127 --> 00:05:40,627
Not anymore! Look!

68
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:47,755
Sokka, wait! You shouldn't be eating strange plants!

69
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:52,127
There's water trapped inside these!

70
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:53,127
I don't know...

71
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:56,108
Suit yourself. It's very thirst-quenching, though.

72
00:06:02,627 --> 00:06:04,252
Drink cactus juice.

73
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:07,252
It'll quench ya! Nothing's quenchier.

74
00:06:07,252 --> 00:06:09,208
It's the quenchiest!

75
00:06:09,627 --> 00:06:12,010
Okay, I think you've had enough.

76
00:06:12,613 --> 00:06:14,227
Who lit Toph on fire?

77
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,627
Can I get some of that cactus?

78
00:06:20,127 --> 00:06:23,306
I don't think that's a good idea. Come on, we need to find Aang.

79
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:30,127
How did we get out here in the middle of the ocean?

80
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:30,627
Uhhh...

81
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:42,627
Appa!

82
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:48,627
Appa!

83
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:57,688
No...

84
00:06:59,684 --> 00:07:01,320
No!

85
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:11,064
What is that?

86
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:12,704
What? What is what?

87
00:07:12,704 --> 00:07:16,196
It's a giant mushroom!

88
00:07:16,196 --> 00:07:18,524
Maybe it's friendly!

89
00:07:18,844 --> 00:07:21,344
Let's just keep moving. I hope Aang's okay...

90
00:07:21,396 --> 00:07:26,233
Friendly mushroom! Mushy giant friend!

91
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:34,092
Yeah, a little barefoot blind girl and her friends passed through here a few days ago.

92
00:07:34,092 --> 00:07:37,773
Did they give you any indication where they were headed?

93
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,397
Maybe you could give me a little incentive?

94
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,704
You suggesting I break your fingers?

95
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:49,214
They went in the desert! Too bad there's almost no chance they survived.

96
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:53,349
That's okay, since she's wanted dead or alive.

97
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:58,093
No she's not! I'm certain her father wants her alive.

98
00:07:58,204 --> 00:08:01,708
Hey, look... Fire Nation wanted posters!

99
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,007
So?

100
00:08:04,032 --> 00:08:07,021
So, look who's here.

101
00:08:25,148 --> 00:08:28,872
I'm sorry, Aang. I know it's hard for you right now,...

102
00:08:28,763 --> 00:08:30,786
...but we need to focus on getting out of here.

103
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:32,076
What's the difference?

104
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:33,972
We won't survive without Appa.

105
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:35,397
We all know it.

106
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:38,206
Come on, Aang! We can do this if we work together.

107
00:08:38,206 --> 00:08:39,040
Right Toph?

108
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,336
As far as I can feel, we're trapped in a giant bowl of sand pudding.

109
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,066
I got nothin'.

110
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,575
Sokka? Any ideas how to find Ba Sing Se?

111
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:51,377
Why don't we ask the circle birds?

112
00:09:07,735 --> 00:09:11,661
Ugh... We're getting out of this desert, and we're going to do it together!

113
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:15,894
Aang, get up. Everybody hold hands. We can do this.

114
00:09:16,144 --> 00:09:17,459
We have to.

115
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:38,726
I think we should stop for the night.

116
00:09:41,601 --> 00:09:43,402
Is there any more water?

117
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,762
This is the last of it. Everyone can have a little drink.

118
00:09:49,787 --> 00:09:53,596
Momo, no! You've killed us all!

119
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,504
No, he hasn't.

120
00:09:56,108 --> 00:09:59,023
Oh, right. Bending.

121
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:04,558
Sokka, let me see the things you got from the library.

122
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:08,022
What!? I didn't steal anything! Who told you that?

123
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:12,150
It was you! You ratted me out!

124
00:10:12,955 --> 00:10:15,159
Sokka, I was there.

125
00:10:16,962 --> 00:10:21,086
It doesn't matter. None of those will tell us where Appa is.

126
00:10:21,191 --> 00:10:24,606
No, but we can find out which way Ba Sing Se is.

127
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:26,921
We can use the stars to guide us.

128
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:30,941
That way we can travel at night when it's cool and rest during the day.

129
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:37,773
Just try to get some sleep. We'll start again in a few hours.

130
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:45,350
No one here is going to help us. These people just look like filthy wanderers.

131
00:10:45,455 --> 00:10:47,058
So do we.

132
00:10:47,673 --> 00:10:51,189
Ah, this is interesting.

133
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:54,997
I think I've found our friend.

134
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:58,816
You brought us here to gamble on Pai Sho?

135
00:10:58,816 --> 00:11:02,026
I don't think this is a gamble.

136
00:11:04,349 --> 00:11:05,953
Let's take them now!

137
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:08,683
This place is full of desperate characters.

138
00:11:09,038 --> 00:11:10,885
If they find out we're collecting a bounty,...

139
00:11:10,885 --> 00:11:16,902
...we might have to fight them all just to keep our prize. Patience.

140
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:20,121
May I have this game?

141
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,332
The guest has the first move.

142
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:29,947
I see you favor the white lotus gambit.

143
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:32,936
Not many still cling to the ancient ways.

144
00:11:33,837 --> 00:11:37,153
Those who do can always find a friend.

145
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:39,056
Then let us play.

146
00:11:54,869 --> 00:12:00,700
Welcome, brother. The White Lotus opens wide to those who know her secrets.

147
00:12:00,913 --> 00:12:03,527
What are you old gasbags talking about?

148
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:08,822
I always tried to tell you that Pai Sho is more than just a game.

149
00:12:11,243 --> 00:12:14,857
I'm not waiting all night for these geezers to finish yapping!

150
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:20,554
It's over! You two fugitives are coming with me!

151
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:25,885
I knew it! You two are wanted criminals with a giant bounty on your heads!

152
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:27,397
I thought you said he would help!

153
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:29,912
He is. Just watch.

154
00:12:30,113 --> 00:12:33,032
You think you're going to capture them and collect all that gold?

155
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,040
Gold?

156
00:12:39,964 --> 00:12:42,671
Uh... Maybe we shouldn't.

157
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:16,169
Come on, get up. We need to go.

158
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:25,212
Yesterday my mouth tasted like mud. Now it just tastes like sand.

159
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:28,225
I never thought I'd miss the taste of mud so much.

160
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:31,578
I'm awake. I couldn't sleep.

161
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:35,305
Well, we need to get moving if we want to get out of this sand pit.

162
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:38,932
Appa!

163
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:41,852
Appa? But why would Princess Yue need him?

164
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:44,976
She's the moon! She flies by herself!

165
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,943
It's just a cloud.

166
00:13:49,943 --> 00:13:51,960
Wait! A cloud!

167
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:55,877
Here, fly up and bend the water from that cloud into my pouch.

168
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:15,846
Wow... there's hardly any in here.

169
00:14:15,846 --> 00:14:19,641
I'm sorry, okay! It's a desert cloud. I did all I could!

170
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:21,869
What's anyone else doing! What are you doing?

171
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:27,917
Trying to keep everyone together. Let's just get moving.

172
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:29,638
We need to head in this direction.

173
00:14:32,477 --> 00:14:38,420
Ow! Crud! I am so sick of not feeling where I'm going!

174
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,619
And what idiot buried a boat in the middle of the desert?

175
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:42,582
A boat?

176
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:46,266
Believe me, I kicked it hard enough to feel plenty of vibrations.

177
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:00,067
It's one of the gliders the sandbenders use!

178
00:15:00,221 --> 00:15:02,728
And look! It's got some kind of compass on it!

179
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:05,478
I bet it can point us out of here!

180
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,816
Aang, you can bend a breeze so we can sail it. We're going to make it!

181
00:15:23,192 --> 00:15:26,010
It is an honor to welcome such a high-ranking member...

182
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,122
...of the Order of the White Lotus.

183
00:15:28,126 --> 00:15:31,250
Being a Grand Master, you must know so many secrets.

184
00:15:32,454 --> 00:15:36,268
Now that you played Pai Sho, are you going to do some flower arranging,...

185
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,789
...or is this club going to offer some real help?

186
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,525
You must forgive my nephew.

187
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:47,358
He is not an initiate and has little appreciation for the cryptic arts.

188
00:15:49,868 --> 00:15:51,672
Who knocks at the guarded gate?

189
00:15:51,673 --> 00:15:55,901
One who has eaten the fruit and tasted its mysteries.

190
00:16:02,431 --> 00:16:06,068
I'm afraid it's members only. Wait out here.

191
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,121
The needle on this compass doesn't seem to be pointing north according to my charts.

192
00:16:25,823 --> 00:16:27,334
Take it easy little lady.

193
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:31,977
I'm sure the sand folks who built this baby know how to get around here.

194
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:37,511
That's what the compass is pointing to! That giant rock!

195
00:16:37,511 --> 00:16:39,420
It must be the magnetic center of the desert.

196
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:42,966
A rock? Yes! Let's go!

197
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:44,646
Maybe we can find some water there!

198
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:48,042
Maybe we can find some sandbenders.

199
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,903
Ahhh... Finally! Solid ground!

200
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:14,620
I think my head is starting to clear out the cactus juice. And look!

201
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:21,923
This tastes like rotten penguin meat!

202
00:17:21,923 --> 00:17:24,217
Awww I feel woozy.

203
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:27,145
You've been hallucinating on cactus juice all day and then...

204
00:17:27,145 --> 00:17:30,657
...you just lick something you find stuck to the wall of a cave?

205
00:17:31,057 --> 00:17:32,969
I have a natural curiosity.

206
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:37,987
I don't think this is a normal cave. This was carved by something.

207
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:41,099
Yeah... look at the shape.

208
00:17:41,503 --> 00:17:45,119
There's something buzzing in here. Something that's coming for us!

209
00:18:12,485 --> 00:18:15,018
What are you doing? That rock almost crushed me!

210
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:17,637
Sorry, I can't tell where they are in the air!

211
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:19,349
I got this one.

212
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,573
Sokka, there's nothing there.

213
00:18:24,985 --> 00:18:27,393
I guess my head's not as clear as I thought.

214
00:18:27,694 --> 00:18:30,609
We have to get out of here! I'm completely out of water to bend!

215
00:18:32,113 --> 00:18:33,411
Momo!

216
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,238
I'm not losing anyone else out here.

217
00:18:40,062 --> 00:18:41,471
Come on, we're going down.

218
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:46,367
Toph, shoot a rock right there.

219
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:47,725
Fire!

220
00:18:49,265 --> 00:18:52,378
Yeah! You got it! She got it, right?

221
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:54,286
Yes. Now let's move.

222
00:19:30,528 --> 00:19:31,943
On your left!

223
00:19:59,246 --> 00:20:01,873
What's going on? Is the club meeting over?

224
00:20:01,973 --> 00:20:06,899
Everything is taken care of. We're heading to Ba Sing Se.

225
00:20:07,013 --> 00:20:10,424
Ba Sing Se? Why would we go to the Earth Kingdom capital?

226
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:14,536
The city is filled with refugees. No one will notice two more.

227
00:20:14,742 --> 00:20:17,067
We can hide in plain sight there.

228
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:20,994
And it's the safest place in the world from the Fire Nation.

229
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,214
Even I couldn't break through to the city.

230
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:27,093
I have the passports for our guests,...

231
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:29,614
...but there are two men out on the streets looking for them.

232
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,549
You seen these guys?

233
00:20:36,622 --> 00:20:40,233
What are you doing in our land with a sandbender sailer?

234
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:43,140
From the looks of it, you stole it from the Hami tribe.

235
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,487
We found the sailer abandoned in the desert.

236
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:47,595
We're traveling with the Avatar.

237
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,518
Our bison was stolen and we have to get to Ba Sing Se.

238
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:56,442
You dare accuse our people of theft while you ride in on a stolen sand sailer?

239
00:20:56,642 --> 00:21:00,258
Quiet, Gashuin. No one accused our people of anything.

240
00:21:00,657 --> 00:21:04,269
If what they say is true, we must give them hospitality.

241
00:21:04,573 --> 00:21:05,973
Sorry, father.

242
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:11,025
I recognize the son's voice. He's the one that stole Appa.

243
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,410
Are you sure?

244
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,222
I never forget a voice.

245
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,436
You stole Appa! Where is he? What did you do to him?

246
00:21:18,636 --> 00:21:21,054
They're lying! They're the thieves!

247
00:21:25,814 --> 00:21:27,716
Where is my bison?

248
00:21:37,155 --> 00:21:39,673
Hey you, where are these men?

249
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,717
I got a tip that they're in your shop.

250
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:45,383
As you can see, no one is here but us.

251
00:21:45,483 --> 00:21:48,817
We know all about your secret back room.

252
00:21:48,817 --> 00:21:50,768
Kick it down.

253
00:21:51,154 --> 00:21:53,477
Hey! That room is for flowers only!

254
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:03,012
Some unlucky soul has an incomplete Pai Sho set.

255
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,930
Let's go back to finding the girl.

256
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,432
You tell me where he is now!

257
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:23,488
What did you do?

258
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,096
I... It wasn't me!

259
00:22:25,104 --> 00:22:26,898
You said to put a muzzle on him!

260
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:29,335
You muzzled Appa?

261
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,914
I'm sorry! I didn't know that it belonged to the Avatar!

262
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:40,732
Tell me where Appa is!

263
00:22:41,032 --> 00:22:45,867
I traded him! To some merchants! He's probably in Ba Sing Se by now!

264
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:47,774
They were going to sell him there!

265
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:52,895
Please! We'll escort you out of the desert! We'll help however we can!

266
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,077
Just get out of here! Run!

267
00:23:40,184 --> 00:23:45,434
