<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:25,048
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:29,210
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:31,050
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:36,989
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,612
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

Chapter Six: Imprisoned

15
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,709
Great, you're back! What's for dinner?

16
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,266
We've got a few options.

17
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:13,249
First, round nuts and some kind of oval shaped nuts,...

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,834
...and some rock shaped nuts that... might just be rocks.

19
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:20,302
Dig in!

20
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:24,928
Seriously, what else ya got?

21
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:34,402
What was that!?

22
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:41,130
It's coming from over there!

23
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:46,175
Shouldn't we run away from huge booms... not toward them?

24
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,322
An earthbender!

25
00:01:57,452 --> 00:01:58,612
Let's go meet him!

26
00:01:58,716 --> 00:02:01,326
He looks dangerous, so we better approach cautiously.

27
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,527
Hello there, I'm Katara! What's your name?

28
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:15,242
Nice to meet you!

29
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,036
We just wanted to say "hi".

30
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,614
Hey, that guy's gotta be running somewhere,...

31
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:23,597
...maybe we're near a village and I bet that village has a market!

32
00:02:23,698 --> 00:02:25,671
Which means no nuts for dinner!

33
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:32,261
Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts! Yeh, I hate'em too.

34
00:02:39,423 --> 00:02:44,027
Great hat. I'll trade you some nuts for it.

35
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:47,800
Hey!

36
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:49,401
Hi, mom.

37
00:02:49,529 --> 00:02:53,871
Where have you been, Haru? You're late! Get started on your chores.

38
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:57,805
Hey, you're that kid! Why did you run away before?

39
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,929
Uh, you must have me confused with some other kid.

40
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,723
No she doesn't, we saw you earthbending.

41
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,505
They saw you doing what?

42
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:11,825
They're crazy, mom, I mean, look at how they're dressed!

43
00:03:12,117 --> 00:03:14,478
You know how dangerous that is!

44
00:03:14,605 --> 00:03:18,565
You know what would happen if they caught you earthbending!

45
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:19,817
Open up!

46
00:03:22,222 --> 00:03:25,775
Fire Nation! Act natural!

47
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:38,321
What do you want? I've already paid you this week.

48
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:43,368
The tax just doubled. Wouldn't want an accident, would we?

49
00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:48,913
Fire is sometimes so hard to control.

50
00:03:54,805 --> 00:03:58,684
You can keep the copper ones.

51
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:04,958
Nice guy. How long has the Fire Nation been here?

52
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:10,584
Five years. Fire Lord Ozai uses our town's coal mines to fuel his ships.

53
00:04:10,731 --> 00:04:12,903
They're thugs, they steal from us,...

54
00:04:13,032 --> 00:04:16,118
...and everyone here is too much of a coward to do anything about it.

55
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:18,686
Quiet, Haru. Don't talk like that.

56
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,536
But, Haru's an earthbender, he can help.

57
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:23,524
Earthbending is forbidden.

58
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:28,509
It's caused nothing but misery for this village. He must never use his abilities.

59
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:31,996
How can you say that? Haru has a gift.

60
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,905
Asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend.

61
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:37,371
It's a part of who we are.

62
00:04:37,489 --> 00:04:39,087
You don't understand.

63
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,135
I understand that Haru can help you fight back.

64
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:45,243
What can the Fire Nation do to you that they haven't done already?

65
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:52,519
They could take Haru away! Like they took his father.

66
00:04:57,841 --> 00:05:01,788
My mom said you can sleep here tonight, but you should leave in the morning.

67
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:06,861
Thanks. I'll make sure Appa doesn't eat all your hay.

68
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:14,521
I'm sorry about what I said earlier. I didn't know about your father.

69
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:15,964
That's ok.

70
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:21,815
It's funny, the way you were talking back in the store, it reminded me of him.

71
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:22,784
Thanks.

72
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,801
My father was very courageous.

73
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,300
When the Fire Nation invaded,...

74
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:29,092
...he and the other earthbenders were outnumbered ten to one,...

75
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:30,752
...but they fought back anyway.

76
00:05:30,886 --> 00:05:33,431
He sounds like a great man.

77
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,625
After the attack,...

78
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:38,927
...they rounded up my father every other earthbender and took them away.

79
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,805
We haven't seen them since.

80
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,254
So, that's why you hide your earthbending?

81
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:49,766
Yeh. The problem is that the only way I can feel close to my father now...

82
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:56,448
...is when I practice my bending. He taught me everything I know.

83
00:05:56,914 --> 00:06:00,343
See this necklace? My mother gave it to me.

84
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:01,507
It's beautiful.

85
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:06,595
I lost my mother in a Fire Nation raid. This necklace is all I have left of her.

86
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:08,516
It's not enough, is it?

87
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:10,451
No.

88
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:16,874
Help!

89
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,440
The mine!

90
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:22,581
Help me!

91
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:31,280
It's not working, we have to get help.

92
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:34,435
There's no time... pull harder.

93
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:37,348
Haru, there's a way you can help him.

94
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:38,462
I can't.

95
00:06:38,561 --> 00:06:43,115
Please, there's no one around to see you, it's the only way.

96
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:57,265
Haru, you did it!

97
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:08,718
It was so brave of Haru to use his earthbending to help that old man.

98
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:10,882
You must have really inspired him.

99
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:12,312
I guess so.

100
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:14,305
Everyone should get some sleep. We're leaving at dawn.

101
00:07:14,403 --> 00:07:16,839
Dawn? Can't we sleep in for once?

102
00:07:16,947 --> 00:07:20,200
Absolutely not! This village is crawling with Fire Nation troops.

103
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:24,993
If they discover you're here, Aang, we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast. Good night.

104
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,277
I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts.

105
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:30,032
Good night.

106
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:57,280
That's him! That's the earthbender!

107
00:08:23,702 --> 00:08:26,203
They took him! They took Haru away!

108
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:26,990
What?

109
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:28,998
The old man turned him in to the Fire Nation.

110
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:31,086
It's all my fault, I forced him into earthbending.

111
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,837
Slow down, Katara, when did this happen?

112
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,400
Haru's mother said they came for him at midnight.

113
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,436
Then it's too late to track him, he's long gone.

114
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:42,698
We don't need to track him. The Fire Nation is going to take me right to Haru.

115
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:45,024
...and why would they do that?

116
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:49,825
Because they're going to arrest me for earthbending.

117
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:54,608
I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work.

118
00:08:54,745 --> 00:08:56,633
There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines,...

119
00:08:56,752 --> 00:09:00,344
...all Aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here.

120
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:04,057
The boulder levitates and... tada! Fake earthbending.

121
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,442
Aang. Did you get all that?

122
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:07,844
Sure, I got it.

123
00:09:07,955 --> 00:09:09,468
Do you remember your cue?

124
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:13,321
Yeh, yeh, just relax. You're taking all the fun out of this.

125
00:09:13,446 --> 00:09:15,970
By "this" do you mean intentionally getting captured...

126
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:17,985
...by an army of ruthless firebenders?

127
00:09:18,105 --> 00:09:20,737
Exactly! That's fun stuff.

128
00:09:20,862 --> 00:09:24,722
Here they come! Get in your places!

129
00:09:26,362 --> 00:09:28,113
Get out of my way, pipsqueak!

130
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:32,626
How dare you call me "pipsqueak" you giant-eared cretin!

131
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:34,523
What did you call me?

132
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:40,327
A giant-eared cretin! Look at those things. Do herds of animals use them for shade?

133
00:09:40,465 --> 00:09:43,711
You better back off! Seriously... back off.

134
00:09:43,862 --> 00:09:45,775
I will not back off!

135
00:09:45,897 --> 00:09:50,163
I bet elephants get together and make fun of how large your ears are!

136
00:09:50,295 --> 00:09:52,691
That's it... you're going down!

137
00:09:52,818 --> 00:09:58,730
I'll show you who's boss... earthbending style!

138
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:06,215
I said, "earthbending style!"

139
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:12,730
That lemur! It's earthbending!

140
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,259
No, you idiot! It's the girl!

141
00:10:15,437 --> 00:10:18,857
Oh, of course.

142
00:10:19,014 --> 00:10:25,952
I'll hold her! You've got 12 hours to find Haru, we'll be right behind you.

143
00:10:32,227 --> 00:10:36,423
Momo, you have some big ears!

144
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:17,928
She'll be fine, Aang, Katara knows what she's doing.

145
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:30,278
Earthbenders, it is my pleasure to welcome you aboard my modest shipyard.

146
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:32,727
I am your warden.

147
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:38,512
I prefer to think of you not as prisoners, but as honored guests,...

148
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:44,725
...and I hope you come to think of me as your humble and caring host.

149
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:49,742
You will succeed here if you simply abide...

150
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:59,465
What kind of guest dishonors his host by interrupting him!? Take him below!

151
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,981
One week in solitary will improve his manners.

152
00:12:03,134 --> 00:12:10,696
Simply treat me with the courtesy I give you and we'll get along famously.

153
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:16,521
You will notice earthbenders, that this rig is made entirely of metal.

154
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:23,014
You are miles away from any rock or earth, so if you have any illusions about...

155
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:28,869
...employing that brutish savagery that passes for bending among you people,...

156
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:33,945
...forget them. It is impossible.

157
00:12:34,158 --> 00:12:37,115
Good day.

158
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:02,203
Katara?

159
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,338
Haru!

160
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:05,202
What are you doing here?

161
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:08,893
It's my fault you were captured. I came to rescue you.

162
00:13:08,993 --> 00:13:11,104
So, you got yourself arrested?

163
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:13,000
It was the only way to find you.

164
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:15,747
You got guts, Katara, I'll give you that.

165
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:19,919
Come one, there's someone I want you to meet.

166
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:25,945
Katara, this is my father, Tyro. Dad, this is Katara.

167
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:29,146
It's an honor to meet you.

168
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:32,531
Have some dinner, Katara.

169
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:36,371
It's not as bad as it looks.

170
00:13:38,848 --> 00:13:41,051
It's still pretty bad though.

171
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:44,404
Tyro, the prisoners are complaining there aren't enough blankets to go around.

172
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:49,011
I'll talk to the guards. In the meantime, make sure the elderly are taken care of.

173
00:13:49,147 --> 00:13:51,978
The rest of us will simply have to hope for warmer weather.

174
00:13:52,104 --> 00:13:54,853
If you don't mind me asking, what's your escape plan?

175
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:56,009
Excuse me?

176
00:13:56,127 --> 00:14:00,516
You know, the plan to get everyone off the rig? What is it? Mutiny? Sabotage?

177
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:05,352
The plan? The plan is to survive... wait out this war.

178
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:09,120
Hope that one day some of us can get back home and forget this ever happened.

179
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:12,826
How can you say that? You sound like you've already given up.

180
00:14:12,948 --> 00:14:17,983
Katara, I admire your courage and I envy your youth,...

181
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:20,533
...but people's lives are at stake here.

182
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:25,418
The Warden is a ruthless man, and he won't stand for any rebellion.

183
00:14:25,554 --> 00:14:28,972
I'm sorry, but we're powerless.

184
00:14:29,194 --> 00:14:32,135
We'll see about that.

185
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:38,473
Earthbenders! You don't know me, but I know of you.

186
00:14:38,598 --> 00:14:42,947
Every child of my water tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave...

187
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:47,957
...Earth Kingdom and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders.

188
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:51,800
Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made you powerless.

189
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:54,877
Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend,...

190
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:59,817
...but they can't take away your courage and it is your courage they should truly fear!

191
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:03,570
Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig,...

192
00:15:03,663 --> 00:15:06,479
...any ocean that keeps you far from home.

193
00:15:06,601 --> 00:15:09,961
It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are,...

194
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:14,792
...hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away.

195
00:15:14,912 --> 00:15:20,710
The time to fight back is now! I can tell you the Avatar has returned!

196
00:15:20,846 --> 00:15:27,906
So remember your courage, earthbenders, let us fight for our freedom!

197
00:16:05,258 --> 00:16:09,011
Your 12 hours are up, where's Haru? We've got to get out of here.

198
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,369
I can't.

199
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,244
We don't have much time, there are guards everywhere. Get on.

200
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:16,163
Katara, what's wrong?

201
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,425
I'm not leaving.

202
00:16:18,906 --> 00:16:22,211
I'm not giving up on these people.

203
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,166
What do you mean you're not leaving!?

204
00:16:27,272 --> 00:16:31,041
We can't abandon these people. There has to be a way to help them.

205
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,959
Maybe she's right. What do you say, Sokka?

206
00:16:34,074 --> 00:16:37,062
I say you're both crazy!

207
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:40,488
Last chance, we need to leave... now!

208
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,836
No.

209
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:47,323
I hate when you get like this. Come on, we better hide.

210
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,834
Look!

211
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:57,867
Tell me exactly what you saw.

212
00:16:57,969 --> 00:16:59,972
Well, Sir, it looked like a flying bison.

213
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:00,536
What?

214
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:04,202
It was a giant flying buffalo, Sir, with an empty saddle.

215
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:07,122
Which was it? A buffalo or a bison?

216
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:12,042
Uh, I'm not sure what the difference is, but that's not really the point is it, Sir?

217
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:16,560
I'll decide what the point is, fool!

218
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:22,775
You! Wake up the Captain. Search the entire rig!

219
00:17:22,818 --> 00:17:23,568
Sir?

220
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:24,355
What!?

221
00:17:24,386 --> 00:17:27,979
That... was the Captain you just threw overboard, so...

222
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:31,443
Then wake up someone I haven't thrown overboard and search the rig!

223
00:17:31,571 --> 00:17:36,404
There's something going on here and I don't like it.

224
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:44,975
We don't have much time. What are we gonna do?

225
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:48,508
I wish I knew how to make a hurricane.

226
00:17:48,603 --> 00:17:51,276
The Warden would run away and we'd steal his keys!

227
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,473
Wouldn't he just take his keys with him?

228
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:55,613
I'm just tossing ideas around.

229
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:59,385
I tired talking the earthbenders into fighting back, but it didn't work.

230
00:17:59,508 --> 00:18:02,494
If there was just a way to help them help themselves.

231
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:08,064
For that they'd need some kind of earth, or some rock... something they can bend.

232
00:18:08,205 --> 00:18:12,186
But this entire place is made of metal.

233
00:18:12,914 --> 00:18:21,987
No, it's not. Look at the smoke. I bet they're burning coal... In other words, earth.

234
00:18:24,457 --> 00:18:28,872
It's almost dawn, we're running out of time! Are you sure this is gonna work?

235
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,853
It should. These vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village.

236
00:18:32,957 --> 00:18:36,184
We're gonna do the same thing, but on a much bigger scale.

237
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,866
There's a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo,...

238
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:42,938
...and the whole system is ventilated. Aang closed off all the vents except one.

239
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,579
When he does his airbending, the coal only has one place to go... right back here.

240
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,625
There's the intruder!

241
00:18:49,752 --> 00:18:51,551
Stay back, I'm warning you!

242
00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:56,525
Katara stop! You can't win this fight!

243
00:18:56,993 --> 00:19:06,187
Listen to him well, child. You're one mistake away from dying where you stand.

244
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:32,162
Here's your chance, earthbenders! Take it! Your fate is in your own hands!

245
00:19:38,285 --> 00:19:39,939
Foolish girl!

246
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:46,370
You thought a few inspirational words and some coal would change these people?

247
00:19:46,494 --> 00:19:53,625
Look at these blank, hopeless faces. There spirits were broken a long time ago.

248
00:19:53,786 --> 00:19:57,097
Oh? But you still believe in them?

249
00:19:57,228 --> 00:20:08,060
How sweet. They're a waste of your energy, little girl. You've failed.

250
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,299
Show no mercy!

251
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:29,731
For the Earth Kingdom, attack!

252
00:21:03,988 --> 00:21:06,364
Get to the ship! We'll hold them off!

253
00:21:06,486 --> 00:21:09,405
Do not let them escape!

254
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:14,548
Guys, throw me some coal!

255
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:30,679
No, please! I can't swim!

256
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:34,987
Don't worry, I hear cowards float.

257
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:47,763
I want to thank you for saving me. For saving us.

258
00:21:47,892 --> 00:21:49,940
All it took was a little coal.

259
00:21:50,061 --> 00:21:54,047
It wasn't the coal, Katara, it was you.

260
00:21:54,174 --> 00:21:58,631
Thank you for helping me find my courage, Katara, of the water tribe.

261
00:21:58,761 --> 00:22:03,078
My family and everyone here owes you much.

262
00:22:03,231 --> 00:22:05,605
So, I guess you're going home now?

263
00:22:05,744 --> 00:22:10,660
Yes, to take back my village. To take back all of our villages!

264
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:16,031
The Fire Nation will regret the day they set foot on our land!

265
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:17,294
Come with us.

266
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:23,978
I can't. Your mission is to take back your home. Ours is to get Aang to the North Pole.

267
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:27,646
That's him, isn't it? The Avatar.

268
00:22:28,612 --> 00:22:31,962
Katara, thank you for bringing my father back to me.

269
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:36,318
I never thought I'd see him again. I only wish there was some way...

270
00:22:36,432 --> 00:22:42,044
I know. My mother's necklace! It's gone!

271
00:22:48,928 --> 00:22:51,112
