00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,850
Assassins. A scout on patrol
discovered them just before dawn.

6
00:00:24,918 --> 00:00:28,329
We believe they're Moonshadow elves.

7
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:33,042
The humans crossed into Xadia
and murdered the King of the Dragons.

8
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:36,426
Then they destroyed his only egg,
the Dragon Prince.

9
00:00:36,513 --> 00:00:40,675
Tonight, we bind our lives to justice.

10

[laughing]

11
00:00:42,514 --> 00:00:44,220
Ezran, you don't get it, do you?

12
00:00:44,307 --> 00:00:48,349
Why do you think they're sending us away?
Because they're coming to kill him.

13
00:00:49,847 --> 00:00:53,553
[Rayla] The human, he looked up at me
and I saw the fear in his eyes.

14
00:00:53,642 --> 00:00:57,030
[Runaan] You let him live,
but you've killed us all.

They'll be on the lookout for us now.

20
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:51,204
Five of us won't be enough.
We need all six.

21
00:01:52,918 --> 00:01:54,957
We'll be stronger as five.

22
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:27,490
Hey, could I borrow
your sharpener thingie?

23
00:02:29,162 --> 00:02:30,455
Whetstone.

24
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:32,412
Yeah, that.

No.

26
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:44,924
Come with me.

27
00:02:56,158 --> 00:02:59,574
Ezran, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said what I said.

28
00:02:59,943 --> 00:03:02,066
I'm sure everything's going to be fine.

29
00:03:02,195 --> 00:03:04,074
Come on.
Later, you can call me a jerkface,

30
00:03:04,161 --> 00:03:06,701
and I'll do
the crazy jerkface dance for you.

31
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:09,824
It is a dance of stupitude and sorry-ness.

32
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:14,203
Okay, well, I'm going to go grab
some books for our trip.

33
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,082
We don't have much time,
so I'll be back to help you pack in a few.

34
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:28,723
I thought you could do it, Rayla,
but I was wrong.

35
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,095
You're not wrong. I can do it.

36
00:03:31,182 --> 00:03:33,450
I know you've never taken before.

37
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:35,271
I brought you because you're talented.

38
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:38,525
Maybe the fastest and strongest
of any of us.

39
00:03:38,612 --> 00:03:40,647
But it takes more than that.

40
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:43,691
There's an instinct. A moment of truth.

41
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,408
And in that moment, you hesitate.

42
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:49,614
- I won't hesitate again.
- You will.

43
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:52,325
I see now that you're still just a child.

44
00:03:52,787 --> 00:03:55,917
Your heart isn't hard enough
to do whatever it takes.

45
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:58,498
I messed up. I know I did.

46
00:03:58,585 --> 00:04:01,376
Because I let that human go,
we're all in danger.

47
00:04:01,463 --> 00:04:03,758
But that's why
you have to let me make it right.

48
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:05,468
No, it's too late for that.

49
00:04:05,555 --> 00:04:09,383
I bound myself, my heart for...

50
00:04:10,263 --> 00:04:15,348
You'll be unbound when the job is done.
Your role now is to stay out of the way.

51
00:04:15,477 --> 00:04:18,100
You will wait here, quietly.

52
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:24,440
If we're not back by sunrise, go home.

53
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:41,666
I can fix this.

[giggling]

59
00:05:27,257 --> 00:05:30,256
I thought the book was haunted
or something.

60
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,555
You should have seen
the look on your face.

61
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:35,678
- It was completely adorable.
- Ridiculous.

62
00:05:35,974 --> 00:05:37,769
Did you just say adorable?

63
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:39,018
Did I?

64
00:05:40,603 --> 00:05:43,618
[clears throat] It's so amazing
that you can do things like that.

65
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:46,856
Nah, it's just a simple wind breath rune.

66
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:48,570
Aspiro.

67
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,408
Can you smell the peanut butter?

68
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:54,989
Oh, yeah. Is that part of the spell?

69
00:05:55,076 --> 00:05:56,996
Nope, it's just what I had for lunch.

70
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,826
[both laugh]

71
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:02,079
See this? It's a primal stone.

72
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:06,542
It uses magical energy
from one of the six primal sources.

73
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:10,588
- Look.
- Wow. What's inside?

74
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:17,386
[Claudia] It's a storm, a real storm.
Captured from the top of Mount Kalik.

75
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,890
That's incredible.
You're so lucky you get to learn magic.

76
00:06:20,977 --> 00:06:23,106
Well, you get to learn sword-fighting.

77
00:06:23,193 --> 00:06:25,144
I'd switch places in a second.

78
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,731
[gasps and exclaims excitedly]

79
00:06:38,995 --> 00:06:41,243
I do not understand girls.

80
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:51,462
My king, we have not been able
to find the elves.

81
00:06:52,258 --> 00:06:54,924
Sundown is only an hour away.

82
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:59,428
Soren and the others have returned
to bolster your defenses.

83
00:06:59,724 --> 00:07:01,389
It won't be enough.

84
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:06,352
I've accepted that tonight,
I may pay the price for our mistakes.

85
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:10,106
Harrow, don't give up just yet.

86
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:14,694
Claudia and I are still searching
for a creative solution.

87
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:19,532
Call it what it is... dark magic.

88
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:21,951
Yes.

89
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:25,084
I've spent years going along
with these "creative solutions,"

90
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:26,628
and where has it gotten me?

91
00:07:26,715 --> 00:07:28,833
I don't understand.

92
00:07:28,962 --> 00:07:32,420
I know you don't. Leave me.

93
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:49,776
[exclaims excitedly]

94
00:07:49,863 --> 00:07:53,279
[sighs] Okay, what is that,
with the nose, the finger?

95
00:07:53,366 --> 00:07:55,865
Not everyone speaks Claudia, Claudia.

96
00:07:55,952 --> 00:07:59,864
It means, I've got something.

97
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:06,412
Ezran, we need to get going.
It's almost sundown.

98
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,293
Ez?

99
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:15,588
Oh, no.

100
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:19,342
- Prince Callum.
- Ow! Uh... [chuckles]

101
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:22,261
Of course we're both here.
Why wouldn't we be?

102
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:26,057
Right. Well, the king wants
to see you alone, Prince Callum.

103
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:30,060
Oh, perfect. But he could have seen
both of us if he wanted to.

104
00:08:40,783 --> 00:08:44,247
Yesterday, I had two eggs
for breakfast and I was starving.

105
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:47,917
Today, I had four eggs and I'm stuffed.
So, tomorrow...

106
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:51,040
Three eggs, I get it.
We don't need to talk.

107
00:08:51,127 --> 00:08:54,668
[guard 1] I was going to say
two eggs and one sausage.

108
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,281

[grunting]

113
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:15,583
You wanted to see me?

114
00:10:26,764 --> 00:10:28,429
[Harrow] Prince Callum.

115
00:10:29,183 --> 00:10:33,100
- My king.
- No, I... Please.

116
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:35,148
Okay.

117
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:42,067
Callum, I know I'm not your birth father,
but I want you to know that...

118
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:46,030
[breathes deeply] This isn't easy.

119
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,742
So, the most important things,
I've written down.

120
00:10:50,997 --> 00:10:52,165
A letter?

121
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,957
[Harrow] You'll understand in time.

122
00:10:57,378 --> 00:10:59,793
I want you to break the seal when...

123
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:03,672
Well, you'll know when.

124
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:06,050
When you've been killed.

125
00:11:06,554 --> 00:11:08,386
War is full of uncertainty.

126
00:11:08,473 --> 00:11:13,307
Why can't you do something about it?
Can't you just make peace with them?

127
00:11:13,436 --> 00:11:14,975
It's not that simple.

128
00:11:15,062 --> 00:11:18,270
It seems pretty simple to me.
You don't want to die.

129
00:11:18,357 --> 00:11:20,319
I'm sure the elves and dragons
don't want to die.

130
00:11:20,406 --> 00:11:22,024
So, everyone agrees.

131
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:25,283
There are centuries of history.

132
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,282
Generations of wrongs and crimes.
On both sides.

133
00:11:30,995 --> 00:11:33,583
I am responsible for some of those wrongs.

134
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,788
I have done terrible things.

135
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,540
I thought they were necessary.

136
00:11:38,836 --> 00:11:40,876
Now, I don't know.

137
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:45,255
But I do know I will pay the price
for the choices I made.

138
00:11:45,384 --> 00:11:47,597
There has to be a way to make it right.

139
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:49,218
It's too late.

140
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:52,263
What is done cannot be undone.

141
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,645
But you're the king. You can do anything.

142
00:11:54,732 --> 00:11:57,017
[Harrow sighs and chuckles]

143
00:11:57,104 --> 00:11:59,145
The great illusion of childhood

144
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:01,694
is that adults have all the power
and freedom.

145
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:04,566
But the truth is the opposite.

146
00:12:05,452 --> 00:12:09,243
A child is freer than a king.

147
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:12,786
I'm going to give this back to you
this weekend, okay?

148
00:12:12,854 --> 00:12:15,055
I'm not going to have to open this.

149
00:12:15,706 --> 00:12:17,705
Take care of your brother.

150
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:01,081
[Rayla grunting]

[panting]

152
00:13:16,851 --> 00:13:18,932
You're wrong about me.

153
00:13:20,896 --> 00:13:22,686
I can do this.

154
00:13:24,025 --> 00:13:26,064
I will do this.

155
00:13:42,793 --> 00:13:44,917
Ez, is that you?

156
00:13:45,921 --> 00:13:47,006
Hello?

157
00:14:13,908 --> 00:14:16,448
You know you can't sneak up on me.
[exclaims]

158
00:14:17,953 --> 00:14:20,911
Uh, uh, you're not
who I thought you...

159
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:22,710
You're one of those, with the pointy...

160
00:14:22,797 --> 00:14:24,670
Oh, you don't like my ears?

161
00:14:24,757 --> 00:14:28,633
[stuttering] No. I mean, yeah.
Yes, I do, I guess.

162
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,880
I mean...
I meant the pointy swords.

163
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:35,514
That's far enough.
I'm looking for someone.

164
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:38,887
Oh. Uh, did you check back there?

165
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:41,724
[Rayla yelps]

166
00:14:41,811 --> 00:14:42,855
[Callum panting]

167
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:43,895
[grunts]

168
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:59,158
She's right behind me.

169
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,968
- Hey, you swept the leg.
- What?

170
00:15:13,055 --> 00:15:14,673
[stutters] Nothing.

171
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:22,097
Lord Viren! Claudia! Anyone! [grunts]

172
00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:30,397
You don't have to die.

173
00:15:34,697 --> 00:15:36,701
There are only two targets tonight.

174
00:15:36,788 --> 00:15:39,073
Wait, two? What do you mean?

175
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,830
I'm here for the king.

176
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:44,328
And I'm also here for his son,
Prince Ezran.

177
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,163
You can't. That's not fair.

178
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,796
Why would you hurt someone
who's done nothing wrong?

179
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:50,881
Humans cut down the King of the Dragons,

180
00:15:50,968 --> 00:15:54,504
and destroyed his only egg,
the Dragon Prince.

181
00:15:54,675 --> 00:15:57,257
Justice will not be denied.

182
00:15:57,386 --> 00:15:58,387
I see.

183
00:15:58,888 --> 00:16:01,386
Well, then, you've found me.

184
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:04,806
I am Prince Ezran.

185
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:16,984
[door opens]

186
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:21,240
Not a great day for a picnic, Viren.

187
00:16:21,786 --> 00:16:23,825
On that, we agree.

188
00:16:25,456 --> 00:16:29,081
Moonshadow elves
are dangerous, elite fighters.

189
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:31,917
Under a full moon,
they become nearly invisible,

190
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:34,008
and they can penetrate any defense.

191
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:37,094
Nothing in the five kingdoms
can stop them.

192
00:16:37,181 --> 00:16:38,757
I know this.

193
00:16:38,886 --> 00:16:42,099
They will find you,
and they will kill you.

194
00:16:42,186 --> 00:16:44,059
Not helping, Viren.

195
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:48,100
But it doesn't have to be you.

196
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:52,151
In the black sands of the Midnight Desert

197
00:16:52,238 --> 00:16:56,984
dwells a mysterious snake
called a soulfang serpent.

198
00:16:57,112 --> 00:16:59,987
The soulfang has an unusual diet.

199
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:04,491
Its bite drains and consumes
the spirit of its prey.

200
00:17:04,662 --> 00:17:10,956
On our last journey into Xadia,
I acquired a rather unique specimen.

201
00:17:15,714 --> 00:17:17,796
[hissing]

202
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:22,342
Two heads, two bites,
two souls held at once.

203
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:27,681
And through magic,
I can switch your spirit with another.

204
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,685
The Moonshadow elves
will find the king's body,

205
00:17:31,897 --> 00:17:35,188
but your spirit will survive.

206
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:40,652
I have to do this. I'm sorry.

207
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:42,493
I don't want to, but I have to.

208
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,698
Why? You know this is wrong.

209
00:17:44,785 --> 00:17:46,997
An assassin
doesn't decide right and wrong,

210
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:48,911
only life and death.

211
00:17:48,998 --> 00:17:51,961
That's very clever, but come on, really?
How does this solve anything?

212
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:55,584
This is justice.
Humans attacked us unprovoked.

213
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:57,883
So it's okay
for you to do the same thing?

214
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:03,550
Well, no. It's not the same thing,
because we're attacking you provoked.

215
00:18:03,804 --> 00:18:05,052
Then it's a cycle.

216
00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:07,810
You hurt me, someone will get revenge
against the elves.

217
00:18:07,897 --> 00:18:10,390
- It won't end.
- [Ezran] Callum.

218
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:12,476
Psst, Callum.

219
00:18:12,605 --> 00:18:14,311
Shh, go away.

220
00:18:14,565 --> 00:18:16,068
[Ezran] I found something.

221
00:18:16,155 --> 00:18:18,028
Are you talking to that painting?

222
00:18:18,115 --> 00:18:20,614
[chuckles nervously]
Uh, why would I do that?

223
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:23,195
'Cause it's not a good time.

224
00:18:23,324 --> 00:18:25,822
[Ezran] You mean,
because you're with a girl?

225
00:18:28,704 --> 00:18:31,578
Uh... Jelly tart?

226
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:33,038
Kid, get out of here.

227
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,336
Callum, what's going on?

228
00:18:34,423 --> 00:18:37,172
Callum? I thought you were Prince Ezran.

229
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:38,627
You lied to me.

230
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:40,759
Okay, how is that worse
than trying to kill someone?

231
00:18:40,846 --> 00:18:43,382
[chomps and swallows]

232
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:47,177
Have you met Bait?
Say hello to my little friend.

233
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:51,139
[Rayla screams]

234
00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:56,269
Callum, follow me.
I have to show you something.

235
00:18:59,193 --> 00:19:01,028
[panting]

236
00:19:07,785 --> 00:19:11,121
No. I won't hide in the body of another,

237
00:19:11,189 --> 00:19:14,444
while someone else dies
paying the price for my decisions.

238
00:19:14,547 --> 00:19:18,709
Two hundred men and women
are ready to fall protecting you tonight,

239
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:21,926
but you won't let one soldier
sacrifice their life for you?

240
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:24,089
It's not the same.

241
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:28,885
I would rather die a king,
than live as a coward.

242
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:32,389
Ah. So, that's what this is really about.

243
00:19:32,476 --> 00:19:33,860
What are you talking about?

244
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,017
Pride.

245
00:19:35,104 --> 00:19:40,105
No, I already told you the problem.
It's dark magic.

246
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:44,443
Yes, it is. It's clever.
It's brilliant. It's practical.

247
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,201
It will save your life
and many, many others.

248
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,932
It's a shortcut.

249
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,120
We may not pay now,

250
00:19:50,207 --> 00:19:52,998
but we will pay
the blood price eventually.

251
00:19:53,085 --> 00:19:56,288
What do you think got us here? Dark magic!

252
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,333
[scoffs] You're acting
stubborn and ungrateful.

253
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,424
Should I be grateful
that you destroyed that dragon's egg?

254
00:20:02,511 --> 00:20:05,631
Thank you
for starting this unwinnable war?

255
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:08,717
Thank you for angering
the dragons and the elves so much

256
00:20:08,804 --> 00:20:10,724
that tonight they are here for my life?

257
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:15,938
Destroying that egg saved our kingdom.
Maybe all of humanity.

258
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:17,726
It was an egg!

259
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:21,480
And it would have become
the most powerful creature in the world!

260
00:20:25,988 --> 00:20:27,444
[Harrow exhales]

261
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:34,576
What is done cannot be undone.
I am offering you a path forward.

262
00:20:34,705 --> 00:20:37,537
Your discomfort is understandable.

263
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,421
You don't feel right
trading your life for another's.

264
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:44,341
But know this,
every one of these men and women

265
00:20:44,428 --> 00:20:48,757
would gladly trade their life
to save yours.

266
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:55,597
Would you, Viren?

267
00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:58,141
I... [sighs]

268
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,023
Get out.

269
00:21:09,073 --> 00:21:11,530
[both panting]

270
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:15,539
[Rayla] You're only making this worse.

271
00:21:15,626 --> 00:21:16,702
Worse how?

272
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:18,370
[Ezran] This way.

273
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:23,166
We're trapped. What do we do now?

274
00:21:24,338 --> 00:21:26,002
Time for a puzzle.

275
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,424
Rock, rock, stone, rock, stone, stone.

276
00:21:30,492 --> 00:21:32,692
- Rock, stone, rock, stone, stone...
- Wait, what's the difference

277
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,016
between the rocks and the stones?

278
00:21:34,103 --> 00:21:36,977
Ugh! You made me do stone
instead of rock.

279
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:38,807
Rock, rock, stone, rock,

280
00:21:38,894 --> 00:21:41,857
- stone, stone, rock, stone, rock.
- Uh...

281
00:21:41,944 --> 00:21:44,229
[door opening]

282
00:21:53,367 --> 00:21:54,451
Wow.

283
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:09,171
Yes!

284
00:22:09,258 --> 00:22:10,969
You're sure
she won't be able to follow us?

285
00:22:11,056 --> 00:22:14,759
No way. It took me over a month
to figure out that combination.

286
00:22:14,888 --> 00:22:17,053
[door opening]

287
00:22:19,768 --> 00:22:21,349
But how did you...

288
00:22:21,436 --> 00:22:24,728
I just pressed all the stones
with the jelly handprints.

289
00:22:39,663 --> 00:22:42,037
What is this place?

290
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,122
Runaan is right.

291
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:47,375
There's nothing in humans worth sparing.

292
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,544
Time's up.

293
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:52,714
Humans destroyed the egg
of the Dragon Prince.

294
00:22:52,885 --> 00:22:54,674
There must be justice.

295
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:57,427
You'll have to get through me.

296
00:22:58,056 --> 00:22:59,057
Really?

297
00:22:59,808 --> 00:23:01,728
Wait. You need to see something.

298
00:23:01,815 --> 00:23:04,857
I'm not falling
for that flashing frog trick again.

299
00:23:04,944 --> 00:23:07,187
[Ezran] He's a glow toad.

300
00:23:07,316 --> 00:23:10,815
But there's no trick this time.
Please, look.

301
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:17,280
Fine. You uncover it. Slowly.

302
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:21,368
I can hear something inside,
something alive.

303
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:29,501
[gasps] It... It can't be.

304
00:23:30,088 --> 00:23:33,004
The egg. It wasn't destroyed.

305
