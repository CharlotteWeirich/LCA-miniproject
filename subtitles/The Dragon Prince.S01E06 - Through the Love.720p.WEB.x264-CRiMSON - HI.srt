That won't change
until we take this egg back to Xadia.

[Runaan] Rayla, we bound ourselves.

There's only one way to release.

11

Soren and Claudia,
with leading the rescue expedition.

Listen, I need you to give me the egg.

00:00:48,072 --> 00:00:50,330
I have to get it to the roof right away.

Hey, I like her, too.
But the thing is, she's...

An elf? Who cares?

00:03:44,294 --> 00:03:47,465
It seems maybe everything
we've ever heard about elves is wrong.

No. I was gonna say, the thing is...

she's not telling us everything.

kind of sleep-talking before?

say anyone's name out loud, did I?

77
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:55,838
No, but you said something about
peanut butter...

Sandwiches. [chuckles nervously]

Yep, I remember now.

80
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:01,290
I was having a dream about sandwiches.

81
00:06:01,472 --> 00:06:05,097
You seemed weirdly excited
about sandwiches.

a heart-to-heart talk about sandwiches.

Go, go, go! We've gotta move.

What's going on? Where were you?

87
00:06:22,952 --> 00:06:24,617
We should eat something first.

We have to get moving now.

91
00:06:30,627 --> 00:06:33,006
Rayla, why? You have to at least explain...

92
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:36,450
I don't have to explain anything to you.
Let's go!

93

Fine. Fine!

[Soren grunting]

96
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:04,037
I love having meetings up here.

97
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:07,648
I get a nice leg workout
going up all those stairs.

98
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,044
We have important things to discuss.
Try and focus.

99
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,290
No problem.

100
00:07:12,377 --> 00:07:15,406
You have my undivided attention.

101
00:07:15,755 --> 00:07:19,177
This evening, you and your sister
depart on a mission.

102
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:21,054
Searching for the princes.

103
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:25,178
[grunts] Oh, yeah.
That's the good kind of burn.

104
00:07:25,265 --> 00:07:29,145
The outcome of your mission is critical
to the future of our kingdom.

105
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:31,756
[chuckles] We got this. We'll find them.

106
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:33,769
I'm sure you will.

107
00:07:33,856 --> 00:07:37,820
But there's a bit of nuance
to this situation.

108
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:40,347
No idea what nuance is.

109
00:07:41,281 --> 00:07:42,695
Listen closely.

110
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:47,288
You are to return with the terrible news
that the princes have perished.

111
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,576
Wait.

112
00:07:48,663 --> 00:07:50,540
Excuse me?

113
00:07:51,457 --> 00:07:54,874
I think my head was upside down
and it got sort of mixed up.

114
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:56,256
Can you say that again?

115
00:07:56,343 --> 00:08:03,287
You are to return with the terrible news
that both princes have died.

116
00:08:08,182 --> 00:08:10,836
Wait. This path is too easy.

117
00:08:10,977 --> 00:08:14,107
No, it's not.
It's exactly the right amount of easy.

118
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:17,802
No. It's well-worn, it's flat, it's soft.

119
00:08:18,151 --> 00:08:21,722
Sooner or later,
we're going to run into somebody.

120
00:08:24,073 --> 00:08:28,032
We need to go up that way.
Tougher terrain is safer for us.

121
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:29,372
The tougher, the better.

122
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:31,958
- Well, that sounds terrible.
- Exactly.

123
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,901
This is already tough enough.

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,838
Do you have any idea
how heavy this egg is?

125
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:38,542
Uh, no, I don't.

126
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:40,675
Because you won't trust me to carry it.

127
00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:42,338
Well, should we trust you?

128
00:08:42,425 --> 00:08:44,178
Have you told us
the truth about everything?

129
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:48,999
[sighs] Fine, keep carrying
the extremely heavy egg.

130
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:53,254
But quit crying about it.
We're going up this way.

131
00:08:56,856 --> 00:08:58,109
[Soren] So, hold up.

132
00:08:58,196 --> 00:09:01,654
If we return with the news
that the princes have died...

133
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,931
won't that mean we failed?

134
00:09:04,197 --> 00:09:07,493
The coming war will determine
the fate of humanity.

135
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,413
History has come to
a crucial tipping point.

136
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,416
So you're saying,
things could go either way?

137
00:09:13,503 --> 00:09:14,876
[Viren] Precisely.

138
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:17,152
Like a see-saw.

139
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:19,378
Yes.

140
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:22,700
History is like... a see-saw.

141
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:26,429
If we are strong enough
to make the right decisions,

142
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:28,806
humans may finally return to Xadia,

143
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:33,269
and take back the great magical lands
that are rightfully ours.

144
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:35,980
But if we are led by a child king...

145
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:38,399
He'll make bad choices?

146
00:09:38,486 --> 00:09:41,314
He will make weak choices!

147
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:43,649
History will tip the wrong way...

148
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:46,866
and the forces of Xadia will crush
not only Katolis,

149
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,904
but all the five kingdoms!

150
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:53,647
Okay. So I'm supposed to come back
with the news that they're dead.

151
00:09:54,163 --> 00:09:56,817
What I don't understand is...

152
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:59,879
what am I supposed to do
if we find them alive?

153
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,250
Oh...

154
00:10:01,337 --> 00:10:04,033
you'll know the right thing to do.

155
00:10:04,257 --> 00:10:07,340
The right thing. I...

156
00:10:07,427 --> 00:10:09,055
I don't know if I can do that.

157
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:13,851
Out there, in the wild,
accidents happen every day.

158
00:10:13,938 --> 00:10:16,670
Deadly accidents.

159
00:10:17,353 --> 00:10:18,604
My son.

160
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:23,439
This won't be easy, but you are strong.

161
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:26,430
Now, tell no one. Not even Claudia.

162
00:10:26,612 --> 00:10:30,017
You must carry this weight alone.

163
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,811
[inhales sharply]

164
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:38,251
[Viren] It will be a burden for me
to take the throne.

165
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:42,905
And someday that throne
will belong to you.

166
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:47,927
[sighs] All right!

167
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:51,622
Let's stop and eat. I'm starving.

168
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,307
Uh...

169
00:10:55,725 --> 00:10:57,223
Oh, no.

170
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,105
- I don't have the food.
- [Rayla] What?

171
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:03,229
You had one job:
carry your stale human food.

172
00:11:03,316 --> 00:11:04,694
How could you leave it?

173
00:11:04,781 --> 00:11:06,023
You rushed us!

174
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,615
You were yelling at us, and I just...
You made me leave it!

175
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,153
Oh. That's right.

176
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,619
Because I remember yelling three things...

177
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,408
"Hurry, hurry." "Let's go, go, go.'"

178
00:11:16,495 --> 00:11:21,110
And, "Be sure to abandon all the supplies
you need to survive."

179
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:25,155
What are we going to do?
We're out of food!

180
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:30,131
Well, I suppose I'd be willing to share
my moonberry juice with you.

181
00:11:30,218 --> 00:11:33,831
It's packed with super nutrients,
and I still have plenty...

182
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,344
Still had plenty.

183
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:37,768
Someone drank it all!
Who went through my stuff?

184
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,558
- I didn't touch your things!
- Don't look at me!

185
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:41,981
Well, I didn't drink it.

186
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,567
If one of you didn't sneak it, then who?

187
00:11:44,654 --> 00:11:46,092
[Bait hiccups]

188
00:11:46,484 --> 00:11:47,484
Wait.

189
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:51,181
- Did that little frog monster...
- [hiccups]

190
00:11:51,739 --> 00:11:54,535
Bait wouldn't do that!
You have no reason to think...

191
00:11:54,622 --> 00:11:56,495
- [Bait hiccups]
- Don't accuse him!

192
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:57,997
Look at how he's glowing!

193
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:01,584
Well, Bait glows different ways
depending on how he's feeling.

194
00:12:01,671 --> 00:12:07,089
Like, he has one color if he's lonely.
Or he glows another way if he's hungry.

195
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:09,461
Or angry. Or hangry!

196
00:12:09,548 --> 00:12:11,844
That's when you're so hungry
that you're angry...

197
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:15,080
[scoffs] I know what "hangry" means.

198
00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:18,709
So what does that color mean?

199
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:24,059
Hmm. Actually, I've never seen him
glow that way before.

200
00:12:24,146 --> 00:12:27,276
Kind of a reddish, purplish...
berry color.

201
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:28,363
[burps]

202
00:12:28,818 --> 00:12:30,345
Yeah, he did it.

203
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:31,972
[Rayla sighs]

204
00:12:32,738 --> 00:12:34,408
I think she's hangry.

205
00:12:34,495 --> 00:12:37,686
I'm habsolutely hurious!

206
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:00,808
[sizzles]

207
00:13:05,187 --> 00:13:08,091
Speak your true nature to me.

208
00:13:08,774 --> 00:13:10,985
[chanting]

209
00:13:14,947 --> 00:13:15,947
Nothing?

210
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:18,160
You are a stubborn magic mirror.

211
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:20,241
You think I haven't tried that?

212
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:22,832
I've cast eight different reveal spells.

213
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,620
They all failed.

214
00:13:24,707 --> 00:13:29,255
At the end, I see nothing but my own
frustrated face staring back at me.

215
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,424
Well, maybe it's just a mirror.

216
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:32,461
[Viren sighs]

217
00:13:32,548 --> 00:13:35,381
Of all the treasures, artifacts and relics

218
00:13:35,468 --> 00:13:38,180
in the lair
of the Dragon King and Queen...

219
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:41,041
they kept this close to where they slept.

220
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:43,269
It must be important.

221
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:46,713
Then we'll figure it out.
Whatever it takes.

222
00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:50,300
Hear that, mirror?
I'm putting you on notice.

223
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:53,946
Kind of weird how the mirror
did it right back at me.

224
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,557
Like it was putting me on notice.

225
00:13:57,156 --> 00:13:59,243
We have something important to discuss.

226
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,572
Your mission.

227
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:02,658
- To rescue the princes.
- Yes,

228
00:14:02,745 --> 00:14:06,542
but you will have a secret mission
that is far more important.

229
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:07,629
Claudia,

230
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:10,666
you must recover that dragon egg.

231
00:14:10,753 --> 00:14:13,799
They have it with them,
so shouldn't be a problem.

232
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,254
Princes, egg...

233
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:18,888
I've got room for a third mission
if you need anything else while we're out.

234
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:20,973
The egg cannot fall into the wrong hands.

235
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,809
It is too powerful, too dangerous.

236
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:29,101
Whatever happens, whatever accidents
or tragedies may occur...

237
00:14:29,188 --> 00:14:32,652
above all else,
you must return with that egg!

238
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,487
- I understand.
- Good.

239
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,108
One question.

240
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:39,194
Let's say we're attacked
by giant bumble-scorps,

241
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:41,243
and they're all buzzing like...

242
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,781
[buzzing]

243
00:14:42,868 --> 00:14:44,747
and flailing their scorps at us like...

244
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:46,619
[buzzes rhythmically]

245
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:51,337
and I'm forced to choose between
saving the egg and saving Soren.

246
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,322
What should I do?

247
00:14:55,548 --> 00:14:57,296
Dad, it's a joke.

248
00:14:57,383 --> 00:14:59,131
Relax, I'm kidding.

249
00:14:59,218 --> 00:15:00,763
[buzzes and chuckles]

250
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,624
Everything will be fine.

251
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:05,057
The egg.

252
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:10,380
If you have to choose, choose the egg.

253
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,392
Rayla, can you slow down?
It's getting a little tricky.

254
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:25,658
Rayla! Come on!

255
00:15:25,753 --> 00:15:28,001
You're the one who made us
take this crazy route,

256
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,816
at least let us keep up with you.

257
00:15:29,884 --> 00:15:33,695
I just need to put this down a second
and catch my breath.

258
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:36,048
There is a solution, you know.

259
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,367
You can just let me carry the egg.

260
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,971
You realize that
I could just take it, right?

261
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:44,760
I could just take it from you
any time I wanted.

262
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:47,143
Yeah, that's good, Rayla.
Way to increase trust.

263
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,019
But I don't. That's the point.

264
00:15:49,106 --> 00:15:51,183
Oh, well, congratulations!

265
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,816
You haven't threatened us
and forced us to give you the egg?

266
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:55,109
You deserve a medal.

267
00:15:55,196 --> 00:15:58,524
- You're a hero! [echoing]
- [cracking in distance]

268
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:01,449
[Rayla] I could take it! I could return it
to Xadia on my own...

269
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:03,117
Guys, you need to keep it down...

270
00:16:03,204 --> 00:16:04,370
I would be a hero!

271
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:05,661
Then what's stopping you?

272
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:07,663
Because it has to come from you.

273
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,994
Human princes,
returning the egg to the Dragon Queen.

274
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:12,418
That's the gesture that matters.

275
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,837
That could end the war,
and change the world...

276
00:16:14,924 --> 00:16:16,125
[Ezran shushes]

277
00:16:16,212 --> 00:16:18,758
You guys need to stop fighting. Look!

278
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:21,130
[ice cracking]

279
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:23,549
All your yelling is cracking the ice.

280
00:16:23,636 --> 00:16:26,599
If we're not careful,
we could start an avalanche.

281
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:27,808
- Got it?
- Uh-huh.

282
00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:29,376
Not a peep.

283
00:16:29,975 --> 00:16:32,379
Good. It stopped cracking.

284
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:37,942
[burps]

285
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:40,429
[burp echoing]

286
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,870
Run!

287
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:59,629
[screams]

288
00:17:03,843 --> 00:17:05,007
[groans]

289
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:08,749
- What happened to your hand?
- Don't worry about it. Just run!

290
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:13,646
We're not going to make it!

291
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,964
It's like a... snow-nami!

292
00:17:17,523 --> 00:17:21,011
- Callum, what are you doing?
- Get behind me.

293
00:17:22,528 --> 00:17:24,014
[Bait whimpers]

294
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,075
Aspiro!

295
00:17:28,742 --> 00:17:29,785
[exhales]

296
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,462
[pants]

297
00:17:41,297 --> 00:17:42,866
[all screaming]

298
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:50,973
[gasps]

299
00:17:55,895 --> 00:17:57,631
Is everyone okay?

300
00:17:58,606 --> 00:17:59,728
[grunts]

301
00:17:59,815 --> 00:18:03,220
Where's that hiccuping, juice-thief frog?

302
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,869
He's right there, and he's okay.

303
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,603
We all made it!

304
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:15,148
I'll go get the egg.

305
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:23,740
[Callum] Ez! Don't move.
We're coming to get you.

306
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:41,258
Hey, Sor-bear. What's wrong?
You look kind of down.

307
00:18:42,107 --> 00:18:45,529
Aw, grizzly, grizzly Sor-bear! [chuckles]

308
00:18:45,616 --> 00:18:49,433
Did Dad say anything strange to you?

309
00:18:49,698 --> 00:18:51,780
Yeah, he kind of did.

310
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:54,079
Did he say anything strange to you?

311
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,284
Uh...

312
00:18:55,371 --> 00:19:00,527
No. Totally not, just a standard Dad chat.
What? [chuckles nervously]

313
00:19:00,668 --> 00:19:03,041
Oh. Okay, I guess.

314
00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:07,451
So... what did he say to you
that was so strange?

315
00:19:09,134 --> 00:19:13,707
Uh, he said that walnuts
are his favorite... fruit!

316
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:16,722
I mean, that's crazy, right?

317
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:19,647
- I don't even think they're a fruit.
- They're not.

318
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:21,310
Well, that is strange.

319
00:19:21,397 --> 00:19:24,568
I mean, what's his favorite vegetable,
ice cream?

320
00:19:24,655 --> 00:19:27,691
[laughs, snorts]

321
00:19:27,778 --> 00:19:29,192
[laughs]

322
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,618
Anyway. Are you ready for our mission?

323
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,656
Yeah. I guess I am.

324
00:19:34,743 --> 00:19:37,206
Great. I'm sure you won't die.

325
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:39,375
- What?
- On this mission.

326
00:19:39,462 --> 00:19:44,088
I mean, eventually you will die. I assume.
But who knows?

327
00:19:44,175 --> 00:19:45,965
Maybe you won't!

328
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,908
Thanks, Claudia.

329
00:20:02,187 --> 00:20:04,841
Stay still, we're almost there.

330
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:14,768
Easy does it. Just pass it over.

331
00:20:19,204 --> 00:20:20,414
What now?

332
00:20:22,207 --> 00:20:25,028
Now... I'm going to hand you the egg.

333
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:28,698
I'm sorry if I was a jerk before, Rayla.

334
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:31,093
We're lucky to have you as our friend.

335
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,119
I do trust you.

336
00:20:34,386 --> 00:20:38,387
No, wait. I don't deserve your trust...
Not yet.

337
00:20:38,474 --> 00:20:40,293
I need to tell you the truth.

338
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:43,689
This morning, the big rush was because
I was attacked by someone.

339
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,900
A human. I fought him off,
but it was hard.

340
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:48,718
Because of this.

341
00:20:48,901 --> 00:20:51,733
- You don't need to do this right now.
- Yes, I do.

342
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,407
This is an assassin's binding.

343
00:20:53,494 --> 00:20:56,226
A Moonshadow elf ritual.

344
00:20:56,408 --> 00:20:59,204
Before I met you, I swore an oath.

345
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,064
I bound myself...

346
00:21:01,497 --> 00:21:03,203
to end Prince Ezran's life.

347
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:06,045
And this binding will never come off
while he's alive.

348
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:10,299
It will just get tighter and tighter
until I lose my hand.

349
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:12,742
But I'm ready to pay that price.

350
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:19,291
Thank you for telling us,
but we need to focus on the situation.

351
00:21:19,765 --> 00:21:21,710
There's one more thing.

352
00:21:22,935 --> 00:21:26,184
The night I met you,
something bad happened.

353
00:21:26,271 --> 00:21:28,067
- [ice cracking]
- Rayla, there's no time.

354
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:31,219
Callum, I need to tell you. The King...

355
00:21:31,693 --> 00:21:33,263
Just take it!

356
00:21:33,737 --> 00:21:34,738
[groans]

357
00:21:40,702 --> 00:21:44,083
- You dropped it!
- I just told you my hand was messed up.

358
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,793
Well, use the other hand!

359
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,279
Stop arguing! We have to do something.

360
00:21:49,878 --> 00:21:52,240
Ez, no! Ezran!

361
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:54,868
- I'm going in after him.
- Don't!

362
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,465
What? Why?

363
00:21:56,552 --> 00:21:58,597
He'll get it. He'll save the egg.

364
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,295
We have to believe in him.

365
00:22:00,381 --> 00:22:02,735
And we're going to need to be up here
to pull him out.

366
00:22:02,803 --> 00:22:05,498
- He's just a kid!
- He's brave and strong.

367
00:22:05,566 --> 00:22:07,505
He can do this.

368
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,981
Come on. Come on!

369
00:22:13,068 --> 00:22:15,889
It's going to be okay. Ez will get it.

370
00:22:34,256 --> 00:22:36,576
[sighs] You were wrong.

371
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:38,912
He's not coming back.

372
00:22:39,678 --> 00:22:41,664
I'm so sorry.

373
00:22:41,847 --> 00:22:44,584
I thought he would be able to.

374
00:22:48,896 --> 00:22:52,150
He's alive! The binding is still tight.

375
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,735
Ez is still alive.

376
00:22:53,822 --> 00:22:55,762
He has to be.

377
00:22:57,738 --> 00:22:59,406
[knocking]

378
00:23:06,121 --> 00:23:07,664
[grunting]

379
00:23:17,382 --> 00:23:19,160
[Callum grunts]

380
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,222
Ezran?

381
00:23:25,182 --> 00:23:29,671
Ez... Ez, you saved it.
You got the egg back. You did it!

382
00:23:29,895 --> 00:23:33,800
Please, Ezran, you gotta be okay.
Just say something.

383
00:23:39,655 --> 00:23:44,894
[shivering] I think I got
a case of the frozie-toesies.

384
00:23:45,494 --> 00:23:46,538
[Callum chuckling]

385
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,107
[Callum and Rayla exclaim]

386
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,333
Oh, no.

387
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:01,166
Something's wrong with the egg.

388
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,494
