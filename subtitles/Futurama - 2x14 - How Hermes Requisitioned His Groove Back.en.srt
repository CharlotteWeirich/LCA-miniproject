00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:09,403
How Hermes Requisitioned
His Groove Back

2
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,007
Finally, the last form of the day.

3
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:41,491
Welcome to stampy town,
population five.

4
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:48,207
And now for the finishing touch.

5
00:00:54,773 --> 00:00:57,492
The cycle of bureaucracy.

6
00:00:58,053 --> 00:01:02,205
Sweet gorilla of Manila!
A letter from Central Bureaucracy!

7
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:07,652
Attention: You are about to receive
a letter from Central Bureaucracy.

8
00:01:08,293 --> 00:01:10,648
It's from Central Bureaucracy!

9
00:01:11,253 --> 00:01:14,848
I'm playing poker with friends
from my old job.

10
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:16,128
Interested?

11
00:01:16,373 --> 00:01:18,409
I only gamble with chumps.

12
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:19,728
-I'll play.
-I'm in!

13
00:01:19,973 --> 00:01:21,326
Leela. Fry. Robot.

14
00:01:21,613 --> 00:01:24,127
No matter what, I'm available.

15
00:01:24,373 --> 00:01:27,922
We're playing poker.
But my friends are serious.

16
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,888
Bah! Big shots. I say let the dice
do the talking.

17
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:44,721
-Is someone fired?
-Better.

18
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:48,130
Central Bureaucracy
is inspecting tomorrow.

19
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:53,288
I'll finally be promoted to grade 35,
the 35th highest grade there is.

20
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:59,247
Hermes, we're having a poker party.
Whip off some of your jerk dip.

21
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:02,127
I spent all day cleaning my office.

22
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:07,128
I got to relax the Jamaican way:
warm milk and a good night's sleep.

23
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:11,406
Jamaican? I thought you were
an outer space potato man.

24
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:13,689
That must be my old boss.

25
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:17,842
-Hi, Leela. You're fired.
-I know.

26
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:21,244
Sorry, but you're over a year
late for work.

27
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:23,882
Let the games begin!

28
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:28,889
So I said, "Your request for a date
is flattering, but I decline. "

29
00:02:29,173 --> 00:02:31,971
Office romances never work out.

30
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:35,051
That's how I met my horrible wife.

31
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:40,931
You never wore your ring.
I didn't know.

32
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:45,530
She doesn't know I work.
I keep my personal life separate.

33
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:49,488
Deal! You'll have time to talk
when you're poor.

34
00:02:49,693 --> 00:02:52,207
-What's with those?
-My lucky shades.

35
00:02:52,453 --> 00:02:57,402
I got them off a lucky guy while his
lucky seeing-eye dog was whizzing.

36
00:03:02,093 --> 00:03:03,731
Hey!

37
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:07,530
I can't spell anything
with these cards.

38
00:03:13,453 --> 00:03:15,842
Finally, I have a good claw!

39
00:03:16,093 --> 00:03:20,848
Three females, a number and a king
giving himself brain surgery.

40
00:03:21,093 --> 00:03:24,722
It won't matter how many you got.
Bender's hot.

41
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:28,892
Uh, what can I say?
Must be my lucky shades.

42
00:03:30,813 --> 00:03:34,442
Nothing. Nothing. Crap. Crap. Garbage.

43
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:37,167
Read them and leak saltwater.

44
00:03:37,453 --> 00:03:40,206
-Oh, man.
-My baby's milk money!

45
00:03:41,373 --> 00:03:44,126
What will I tell my horrible wife?

46
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:49,322
I'd be more worried about the tapeworm
going to town on your intestines.

47
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,327
Let me see those glasses!

48
00:03:56,813 --> 00:03:59,646
Oh, my various gods! X-ray specs!

49
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:04,449
I swear those are prescription.
I need them for reading stuff.

50
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:06,649
-Behind other stuff.
-Cheater!

51
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:08,167
Break his neck!

52
00:04:08,453 --> 00:04:11,525
No! Don't hurt him!
He's my best friend--

53
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:26,444
Hey, you wouldn't hit a guy
with x-ray glasses, would ya?

54
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:30,322
Easy on the arm. Oh! Oh, my ass!

55
00:04:44,853 --> 00:04:46,730
Great cow of Moscow!

56
00:04:49,893 --> 00:04:54,011
Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones!
And a tornado!

57
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:56,727
I'll never pass inspection now!

58
00:04:56,933 --> 00:05:01,324
They'll bust me lower than a limbo
stick at carnival time!

59
00:05:01,613 --> 00:05:04,844
And that's as low as limbo sticks get.

60
00:05:05,093 --> 00:05:07,732
Don't worry. We'll watch you clean.

61
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:12,285
It's too late. The inspector'll
be here in exactly one second.

62
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:16,730
-Who are you?
-Morgan Proctor, grade 1 9.

63
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:19,089
Hermes Conrad, grade 36.

64
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:26,092
-Enough banter. Shall we begin?
-This way, please.

65
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:28,928
Jeez, you seem awfully calm.

66
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:31,323
Don't worry. I have a plan.

67
00:05:31,613 --> 00:05:33,012
I'm going to jump!

68
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:34,692
-No!
-No!

69
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:36,406
Do a flip!

70
00:05:38,493 --> 00:05:41,803
Don't do it!
You have so much to live for!

71
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:43,844
Reverse psychology?

72
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:48,803
Old friend, don't jump! Use a method
that won't damage your liver.

73
00:05:49,093 --> 00:05:51,323
Others need it, you know?

74
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:53,845
Husband, no!

75
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:57,011
Out of my way! I'm not cut out
to be a bureaucrat!

76
00:05:57,213 --> 00:06:00,649
I'm only anal 78.36% of the time.

77
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:05,921
I'm not worthy to stamp a form,
so I'll stamp the cement with my body!

78
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:11,412
If you complete your death transaction
without filing a suicide. . .

79
00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:14,844
. . .and/or falling permit,
you'll be demoted.

80
00:06:15,613 --> 00:06:17,604
Life. Death.

81
00:06:17,853 --> 00:06:21,050
Either way I'm demoted
to a tiny cubicle.

82
00:06:22,813 --> 00:06:26,488
Sweet something of-- Of someplace.

83
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:31,130
I relieve you of duty.
Consider yourself on paid vacation.

84
00:06:31,413 --> 00:06:33,722
Oh! The ultimate penalty.

85
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:38,649
I recommend the health cure on Spa 5,
the Sauna planet. Here, read.

86
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:40,412
Spa 5? ls it good?

87
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:44,083
Wonderful. I don't know
anything about it. . .

88
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:47,330
. . .they give me krill
for everyone I send.

89
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:50,571
I have to assign
a bureaucrat to fill in.

90
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:53,367
I assign me. I accept. Welcome.

91
00:06:53,653 --> 00:06:57,566
It's settled. Hermes will relax
and Zoidberg will eat.

92
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:05,612
Last Monday, why did it take
twice as long as scheduled?

93
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:10,051
-Fry got his head stuck in a crater.
-I thought it'd fit.

94
00:07:10,613 --> 00:07:15,812
-During this, what were you doing?
-Drinking contest with the autopilot.

95
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:19,932
-I'd have won but I ran out of olives.
-I can explain.

96
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:24,684
You can explain how you left
without enough olives? I think not.

97
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:28,010
-Is this high school?
-Locker check!

98
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:32,243
Why isn't this alphabetical?

99
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:35,883
-What?
-The zipper should be at the bottom.

100
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,207
Uh, sometimes a guy gets lonely.

101
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:52,126
Oh, l-- I've never seen
anything like this!

102
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,724
-Why's there yogurt in this?
-I can explain.

103
00:07:57,013 --> 00:08:00,688
It used to be milk, and time
makes fools of us all.

104
00:08:00,973 --> 00:08:04,648
You're dismissed!
Fry, I'll speak to you alone.

105
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:11,810
This is the other Fry's locker.
I'm "Phry. "

106
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:14,607
Admit it, Fry. You're a slob.

107
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:16,849
A dirty, filthy slob.

108
00:08:19,093 --> 00:08:21,607
Dirty boy! Dirty, dirty, dirty!

109
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:25,567
What's going on?
I thought you were anti-dirty!

110
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:28,453
I'm surrounded by neat all day.

111
00:08:28,653 --> 00:08:31,372
Nothing's kinkier than a slop-jock.

112
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:33,211
Oh, stop.

113
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:39,443
Listen, you pig. No one can know.
If anyone asks, I'll deny it.

114
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:41,769
Like every girl I dated.

115
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:48,084
And two, and three, and four.
Come on, work those arms!

116
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:54,292
This is no spa, it's a labor camp.

117
00:08:54,573 --> 00:08:59,249
If I get out, Zoidberg will see
the business end of a shrimp fork!

118
00:08:59,493 --> 00:09:03,247
Give him one for me, mate.
Don't know why I go to him.

119
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:05,808
I don't miss twice, campers.

120
00:09:08,453 --> 00:09:10,409
For those six reasons. . .

121
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:14,646
-. . .I'm demoting Leela to copilot.
-Under who?

122
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:17,401
-The autopilot.
-That drunk?

123
00:09:18,053 --> 00:09:22,968
Bender, you're in charge
of the professor's bodily functions.

124
00:09:23,253 --> 00:09:24,652
It's full-time.

125
00:09:24,893 --> 00:09:28,442
Fry, I'm promoting you
to executive delivery boy.

126
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,402
You won't deliver.
You'll get an office next to me.

127
00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:33,887
All right!

128
00:09:35,293 --> 00:09:39,411
Would you high-five him so we can
continue this meeting?

129
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,569
And on the rebound?

130
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:44,122
Adjourned.

131
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:50,487
I don't know why she's nice to you.

132
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:54,368
She's a hateful monster.
She scolded and hit me.

133
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:57,371
She's risking my friendship with her.

134
00:09:57,773 --> 00:09:59,445
What happened to you?

135
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:03,043
I walked the professor.
We were in the park. . .

136
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:06,046
. . .and a lady says I stole her purse.

137
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:11,492
I threw the professor at her.
I had to hit her with a purse I found.

138
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:15,885
It's Morgan's fault.
That pencil-pushing scaz-wag.

139
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:17,970
If she were here, I'd. . . .

140
00:10:18,253 --> 00:10:22,326
-Uh-oh, is she behind me?
-No. I'm in front of you.

141
00:10:26,573 --> 00:10:28,723
Morgan? It's 3 a.m.

142
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:33,325
A skunk knocked over my garbage,
and I could only think of you.

143
00:10:37,093 --> 00:10:39,561
My God, it's so. . .

144
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:41,971
. . .repulsive.

145
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:44,843
So, this is where you eat?

146
00:10:45,093 --> 00:10:46,845
Eat and sleep.

147
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:48,922
Oh, Fry!

148
00:10:50,813 --> 00:10:53,691
Bender's my roommate.
He could be back.

149
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:57,648
I ordered him to flush out
the professor's earwax.

150
00:11:00,413 --> 00:11:04,531
Hey, Fry? I made you
a candle with-- What the--?

151
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:12,922
Oh, now I see. Now I get it.
Now the pieces are falling into place.

152
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:17,928
The promotion, the dwarf in my
book club who steals my opinions.

153
00:11:18,213 --> 00:11:19,851
It's coming together!

154
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:23,569
I must say this opens my eyes!

155
00:11:23,853 --> 00:11:26,447
Another case closed, my dear Watson.

156
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:28,451
Come back! It's a loop!

157
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:32,163
For I was blind, but now I see.

158
00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:34,489
The cat's out of the bag!

159
00:11:34,773 --> 00:11:38,686
About last night,
that was just a misunderstanding.

160
00:11:38,973 --> 00:11:43,569
You didn't understand? I'll explain.
You were having sex with you.

161
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:47,163
No. A bureaucrat of my rank
can't fraternize.

162
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:52,049
That's what makes it so juicy.
It's the forbidden fruit angle.

163
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:55,444
"Guess who saw
Fry and Morgan doing it. "

164
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:57,445
They'll say, "Who, Bender?"

165
00:11:57,653 --> 00:12:01,692
And I'll say,
"It was lovable old Bender. . . . "

166
00:12:03,093 --> 00:12:04,287
What'd you do?

167
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:07,730
Downloaded his brain. Bender is here:

168
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:11,005
His memories,
his in-your-face interface.

169
00:12:11,253 --> 00:12:14,165
I am Bender. Please insert girder.

170
00:12:14,453 --> 00:12:18,162
But-- But Bender need brain.
For smart making!

171
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:22,605
Stop doing things!

172
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:25,731
I sent it to be filed at Central.

173
00:12:25,973 --> 00:12:28,567
I had to. He was a bad robot.

174
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:31,651
He was a bad friend.
I want him back!

175
00:12:31,893 --> 00:12:35,044
You should've filed a request
20 years ago.

176
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:38,171
I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy!

177
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:42,766
Dirty boy! Dirty boy. . . .

178
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:49,684
You were having an affair?

179
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:52,646
She loved me because I'm a slob.

180
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:55,453
I loved her because I'm desperate.

181
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,725
I am Bender. Please insert girder.

182
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:02,562
Without his brain,
he's quiet and helpful.

183
00:13:02,853 --> 00:13:05,765
We have to go to Central
and get the disk!

184
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:07,850
-Oh, yes. We must!
-Yeah!

185
00:13:08,093 --> 00:13:09,651
Why?

186
00:13:10,693 --> 00:13:13,253
Well, that aside, we're going.

187
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:15,808
You can't waltz into Central.

188
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:19,608
It's a tangled web of red tape
and regulations.

189
00:13:19,893 --> 00:13:24,569
I haven't been. A friend went mad
trying to find their washroom.

190
00:13:24,853 --> 00:13:27,287
Then we'll need a guide.

191
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,485
Oh, I've been there! Lots of times.

192
00:13:35,893 --> 00:13:39,010
Carts go out full but come in empty.

193
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:40,612
It's inefficient!

194
00:13:40,893 --> 00:13:44,886
Pulling empty carts
is the closest we get to sleep.

195
00:13:45,173 --> 00:13:47,482
They'd increase efficiency. . .

196
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,651
. . .if empty carts
brought in machinery.

197
00:13:50,893 --> 00:13:53,726
Hey, I like the way you think.

198
00:13:56,493 --> 00:13:57,721
Oh, Lord.

199
00:13:58,893 --> 00:14:02,044
You know, you ought
to be a bureaucrat.

200
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:14,329
-Will this take long?
-Getting my birth certificate.

201
00:14:14,613 --> 00:14:18,447
It doesn't look like I'll make
it inside. Good luck.

202
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,008
Just leave me where I drop.

203
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:23,806
Someone had a baby.

204
00:14:24,053 --> 00:14:26,408
Come on, I have a better idea.

205
00:14:26,693 --> 00:14:31,687
We're from the delivery company.
We're here to deliver a robot.

206
00:14:31,973 --> 00:14:35,204
I am Bender. Please insert girder.

207
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:38,684
Looks like we've got
a new office cutup.

208
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,442
Ooh, ooh! Look out, look out!

209
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:54,009
I'm gonna crash!
I swerved to avoid you.

210
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:57,569
Could you tell us where
the canisters go?

211
00:14:57,853 --> 00:14:59,491
Central filing.

212
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:02,281
-Okay. Thank you.
-Wonderful.

213
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:04,370
No!

214
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,325
Of course I know where it is.
I'm grade 20.

215
00:15:10,573 --> 00:15:12,131
-Where?
-I can't tell.

216
00:15:12,373 --> 00:15:17,401
-What do I look like, a grade 1 6?
-We're getting nowhere slowly.

217
00:15:17,653 --> 00:15:20,804
I'll address this to the filing room.

218
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:24,050
We'll track it with my lojack-a-mater.

219
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:26,602
Cold. Warmer.

220
00:15:26,853 --> 00:15:28,571
Hot, hot, hot, hot....

221
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,732
Don't tell my boss I was asleep.

222
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:58,207
This is it! We'll run in, grab
Bender's disk and run out. Got it?

223
00:16:07,973 --> 00:16:09,645
We'll never find it.

224
00:16:09,893 --> 00:16:13,044
I am Bender. Please insert girder.

225
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,450
You're right!
Nothing's over if there's hope.

226
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:21,562
Lost something?
I should have known you'd come here.

227
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:24,287
And I did. That's why I came.

228
00:16:24,573 --> 00:16:29,010
We're through! You're evil.
I never want to see you again!

229
00:16:29,293 --> 00:16:31,602
Help us for old times' sake?

230
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:34,885
He's lost in the master "in" pile.

231
00:16:35,173 --> 00:16:39,052
It would take an atomic-powered
sorter to find him.

232
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:40,612
You rang?

233
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:46,442
Damn it, jump already!
Stop hogging the healthy liver!

234
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:47,927
I want to live!

235
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:52,604
Organizing the labor spa rekindled
my love of bureaucracy.

236
00:16:52,853 --> 00:16:57,802
My Hermes got that hellhole running
so that all the physical labor. . .

237
00:16:58,013 --> 00:17:00,811
. . .is done by a single
Australian man.

238
00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:03,812
-How'd you find us?
-Dr. Zoidberg.

239
00:17:04,013 --> 00:17:07,005
It was me! I'm the hero!

240
00:17:10,453 --> 00:17:13,809
Request for explanation
of incident meeting.

241
00:17:15,893 --> 00:17:17,531
Number 1 .0!

242
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:21,925
Number 1 .0, I petition you
for an emergency sort. . .

243
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:24,442
. . .under regulation two--

244
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:26,809
Don't quote me regulations!

245
00:17:27,053 --> 00:17:30,011
I was on a committee to review. . .

246
00:17:30,213 --> 00:17:33,250
. . .the color of the book
that regulation's in.

247
00:17:33,493 --> 00:17:35,085
We kept it gray.

248
00:17:35,373 --> 00:17:38,922
I must find the disk
with my friend's brain on it.

249
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:43,604
Very well, but your license
will be revoked if you fail. . .

250
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,885
. . .to sort the master "in" pile
by closing.

251
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:50,927
-1 p.m.
-That's only four minutes from now.

252
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:53,250
Requisition me a beat.

253
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:07,608
I was born, there was a hurricane
We had a foot and a half of water

254
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:12,409
I cried all night
Blew my alphabet blocks out of order

255
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:17,812
This boy's born to be a bureaucrat
Born to be obsessive and snotty

256
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:23,332
I made my relations file applications
To get into my birthday party

257
00:18:23,653 --> 00:18:28,408
-Something changed when he turned pro
-Sorting but wasn 't smiling

258
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:33,812
-He forgot it's not about rank
-It's about the filing, people

259
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:38,644
We didn 't choose to be bureaucrats
That's what almighty Jah made us

260
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:43,808
Treat people like swine, make them
Stand in line, even if nobody paid us

261
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:48,803
The world looks down on bureaucrats
We're anal, compulsive and weird

262
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:53,808
Push comes to shove, do what you love
Even if it's not a good idea

263
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:58,928
-Said I shouldn 't be a surgeon
-Poo-pooed my electric frankfurter

264
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:01,846
Said I shouldn 't fly with one eye

265
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:06,126
I am Bender please insert girder

266
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:08,728
Everybody sing Jamaica

267
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:10,645
Just the bureaucrats

268
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:12,804
Just the grade 19s

269
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:14,771
-Jamaica
-Sing me home

270
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:20,207
Push comes to shove, do what you love
Even if it's not a good idea

271
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:25,082
I'm Bender, baby!
Please insert liquor!

272
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,648
-Yeah!
-Congratulations!

273
00:19:27,893 --> 00:19:32,091
You finished with two seconds
to spare, so I'm demoting you.

274
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:35,012
Good bureaucrats never finish early.

275
00:19:35,253 --> 00:19:37,813
That's okay. At least you're back.

276
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:41,403
Not yet. I'm acting bureaucrat
of Planet Express.

277
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:45,202
I have some changes to make.
Fry, you're fired.

278
00:19:45,453 --> 00:19:46,806
-Second--
-Hold on!

279
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:51,643
While I was sorting, I found a
document filed by Morgan Proctor.

280
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:55,767
Form B. Notification
of Romantic Entanglement.

281
00:19:56,053 --> 00:19:57,532
She fraternized me!

282
00:19:57,773 --> 00:20:01,402
It's not about you.
It refers to my prom date.

283
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:04,725
A date that ended in disappointment.

284
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:08,608
Yes. But you only stamped
it four times!

285
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:12,766
No! No! I was young and reckless!

286
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:17,444
You are technically correct.
The best kind of correct.

287
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:21,487
I hereby promote you
to grade 37.

288
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:23,843
And as for you? Guards!

289
00:20:24,693 --> 00:20:28,845
Bring me the forms I need to sign
to have her taken away.

290
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,643
It looks like I need
my heroic bureaucrat back.

291
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:36,612
At severely reduced pay, of course.

292
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:38,883
-Yeah!
-Better than nothing.

293
00:20:39,173 --> 00:20:41,323
Can I get reduced pay too?

294
00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:45,731
You got it! ln fact, severely
reduced pay all around.

295
00:20:49,173 --> 00:20:52,085
Come on, wife! Let's blow this joint!

296
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:55,648
Now it's time for my song!

297
00:20:56,093 --> 00:21:00,291
When I was 2
There was a tidal wave in-- Aw....
