There's the entrance.

I'm a crazy old man,

00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,756
[sighs] Why not? I love wisdom. Bring it.

179
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,886
Life is like a river.

180
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,848
Ugh! Oh, great.
That's exactly what I was afraid of.

I can't see at all,

You mentioned!

185

You don't know where the river of life
will bend and turn.

You don't know where it will go at all.

How is that supposed to be helpful?

Don't try to control where the river goes.

189
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,163
There's one thing
you can know and control,

00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,873
yourself.

191
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:15,753
Look at yourself. Who are you, Rayla?
What do you stand for?

192
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,882
Once you know that,
then wherever the river takes you,

193
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,135
you'll be right where
you were always meant to be.

Villads, that's amazing.

I was sure you were going to spout
some complete nonsense,

197

We'll never make it.

202
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,334
We have to hold off the dragon
as long as possible

203
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,795
so those carrying the heart
can make it back.

Stop!

205

This is our day to sacrifice.

206
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,759
You get the titan's heart to safety.

207

Save all our people.

Without him to perform the spell,
the heart is worthless,

This is how I've gotten to know them.

They were very brave,

I know it is not my place to say,

that if your mothers were here today,

Perhaps they would.

We received so much kindness

to the game room.</i>

322
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:35,020
<i>There, I have hidden an unusual cube
with rune symbols on each side.</i>

323
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,103
[exclaims]

324
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,402
[Harrow] <i>This cube is an ancient relic</i>

325
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,696
<i>that has been passed down
through the ages.</i>

326
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,326
<i>It belonged to an elven wizard in Xadia,
the Archmage Aaravos,</i>

327
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,037
<i>a master of all six primal sources.</i>

328
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,123
<i>It is hidden in a box of keys</i>

329
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,667
<i>because it is known
as the "Key of Aaravos,"</i>

330
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,047
<i>and legends say it unlocks something
of great power in Xadia.</i>

331
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,635
<i>Perhaps it will be you, Callum,
who discovers the key's secrets.</i>

332
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,096
[croaks]

333
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,349
[Harrow] <i>And one last
extra-super-secret bonus secret.</i>

334
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:16,061
<i>Did you know that Bait,
our most sour friend,</i>

335
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,063
<i>secretly loves belly rubs?</i>

336
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,566
[snorting]

337
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,612
- Aww! Who's a tubby lumpa grump?
- [purring]

338
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:32,160
You probably thought
I was just a crazy old sea captain,

339
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,745
but I've got some good wisdom.

340
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:37,082
I'll admit it.
You do have some good wisdom.

341
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,377
You want to know the other secret to life?

342
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,921
Waterproof socks!

343
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,381
It's a metaphor.

344
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,549
Think about it.

345
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,718
You just showed me the socks.

346
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,595
That's not what a metaphor is.

347
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,938
[both yawning]

348
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,315
[yelps]

349
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,153
What's that for?

350
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,322
You're my brother,
and you mean everything to me.

351
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,615
Is this a trick?

352
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,076
[chuckles] No. I just love you.

353
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,245
- Well, I love you, too.
- [yips]

354
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,415
So are we there yet? Are we close?

355
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,042
[sniffs] We are close.

356
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,296
- I smell land!
- [caws]

357
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,598
Hey, what was that? A shadow?

358
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,850
Eh, you're asking the wrong pirate.

359
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,269
[Rayla] There's something up there.
