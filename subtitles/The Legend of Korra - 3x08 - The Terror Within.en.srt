Earth.

2
00:00:02,935 --> 00:00:03,974
Fire.

3
00:00:04,578 --> 00:00:05,595
Air.

4
00:00:06,414 --> 00:00:07,398
Water.

5
00:00:08,736 --> 00:00:12,393
Only the Avatar can Master all four elements

6
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:15,045
and bring balance to the world.

Korra is now the first metal bending Avatar.

9
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:26,583
At the training with Suyin Beifong,
Korra quickly picked up the new skill

10
00:00:26,604 --> 00:00:28,714
and Bolin is hoping to follow
in her footsteps.

11
00:00:28,734 --> 00:00:31,809
Meanwhile the airbender Zaheer is
closing in on Zaofu.

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,148
By his side is are the lava bender Ghazan,
the water bender Ming-Hua,

13
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,881
and the combustion bender P'Li.

14
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:40,637
But what do these mysterious criminals
want with the Avatar?

15
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:09,398
I can't believe I'm sparring
with the Avatar.

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,486
I can't believe I'm stuck
with her friend.

17
00:01:12,578 --> 00:01:14,870
Hang on, I think I got it.
Let me just try this.

18
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:18,040
No? Okay, maybe if I...
Ahhh!

19
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:19,458
Trial by fire!

20
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,960
It's the best way
to learn metalbending.

21
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:27,809
Oh, nice shot, Bolin.

22
00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:32,059
But I thought you were supposed to be
practicing metalbending, not earthbending.

23
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,496
Yeah, cheater.

24
00:01:33,624 --> 00:01:36,458
Mako, metalbending
is extremely difficult.

25
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,891
No one gets it right away,
if they can get it at all!

26
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:40,419
It's not normal!

27
00:01:46,169 --> 00:01:47,303
Whoohoo!

28
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:49,104
Metalbending champion.

29
00:01:49,106 --> 00:01:50,139
Oh, sure.

30
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:51,607
She's the Avatar.

31
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:53,275
Guys, it's time
to get cleaned up.

32
00:01:53,277 --> 00:01:54,977
Tonight's Opal's farewell dinner.

33
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:57,613
Now I gotta say bye to Opal?

34
00:01:57,615 --> 00:01:59,648
This is the worst day ever!

35
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:10,159
Thanks for making
my favorite meal.

36
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:12,161
I'm really
going to miss you, Opal.

37
00:02:12,163 --> 00:02:15,998
No one appreciates
my raw veggie wraps like you do.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,336
Every time I eat raw kale,
I'm gonna think of you.

39
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:21,355
You're so sweet.

40
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:23,476
This stinks.

41
00:02:23,724 --> 00:02:25,474
We were just starting
to get to know each other

42
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:27,810
and now you're off
to the northern air temple.

43
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:28,976
We'll be together soon.

44
00:02:29,464 --> 00:02:32,081
You guys are heading up after
finding more airbenders, right?

45
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,621
Yeah, but that's...

46
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:34,917
In the future.

47
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,552
Oh, I hate the future.

48
00:02:36,554 --> 00:02:39,842
Until then, we'll
always have kale.

49
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,060
Kid, can I give you
some relationship advice?

50
00:02:45,776 --> 00:02:46,645
Um, no.

51
00:02:46,647 --> 00:02:47,623
Well, your loss.

52
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,980
Zhuli! Bring the, uh, thing.

53
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:53,112
Check out my latest invention.

54
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:55,504
An airbender finder.

55
00:02:55,506 --> 00:02:57,887
Wait, that can find
airbenders?

56
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:04,481
Uh, I think it's broken.

57
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:05,815
It's not broken.

58
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:07,566
She needs to airbend into it!

59
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:09,985
How else do you expect
the thing to work?

60
00:03:09,987 --> 00:03:11,353
<i> What's</i> going on?

61
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:12,822
I can't hear anything.

62
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:14,527
I hate sitting down here.

63
00:03:15,493 --> 00:03:16,859
Not because of you.

64
00:03:16,861 --> 00:03:18,494
I can tell you're lying.

65
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:21,197
Everyone,
if I could have your attention, please.

66
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,583
Tonight, my beautiful little girl
leaves for the northern air temple.

67
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:27,444
Opal, none of us could be
more proud of you.

68
00:03:27,444 --> 00:03:30,840
You're an incredible daughter,
sister, friend,

69
00:03:30,842 --> 00:03:33,586
and soontobe
airbending Master.

70
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:38,848
Here's to Opal.

71
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,010
May she help lead us
into the new era.

72
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:55,422
Lock it down for the night.

73
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:59,427
We'll head out first thing
in the morning.

74
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:36,509
Kale, kale, kale.

75
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:42,512
What? What's going on?

76
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:44,870
Pabu, sleep.

77
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,987
What? Huh? What?

78
00:05:25,988 --> 00:05:26,822
Pabu.

79
00:05:27,605 --> 00:05:28,945
It's not playtime right now.

80
00:05:28,973 --> 00:05:31,295
Okay, we are seriously going to
have to have a talk

81
00:05:31,316 --> 00:05:32,294
what the heck!

82
00:05:32,296 --> 00:05:33,662
They got Korra!

83
00:05:33,664 --> 00:05:35,416
They've got Korra!

84
00:05:38,656 --> 00:05:39,888
Let her go!

85
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:55,484
They've got Korra!

86
00:06:00,408 --> 00:06:02,191
So much
for the element of surprise.

87
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:03,742
Backup plan.

88
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,922
We can't let them take her.

89
00:06:16,924 --> 00:06:19,170
I don't think they're
going to get far. Look.

90
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:31,854
We have you surrounded.
It's over.

91
00:06:31,856 --> 00:06:33,265
Release the Avatar!

92
00:06:50,874 --> 00:06:51,888
No way!

93
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:53,671
That guy's lavabending.

94
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:54,691
That's awesome...

95
00:06:54,912 --> 00:06:57,033
Ly not good for us.

96
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,545
I'm going to create
some cover.

97
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:10,411
We're getting out of here.

98
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:40,402
How did they get in here?

99
00:07:41,313 --> 00:07:44,035
I don't know, but we're
not letting them escape.

100
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:53,712
Whoa!

101
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,785
There's no way
to cross that moat.

102
00:08:00,852 --> 00:08:01,998
We don't need to cross it.

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,384
Lin and I can drop in
from the dome on cables.

104
00:08:04,386 --> 00:08:05,551
That's a great idea.

105
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:08,952
Except we'll get blown up the second
that thirdeyed freak sees us.

106
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:13,698
She's a combustion bender.
If one of you can stun her,

107
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:15,195
her powers will be
knocked out temporarily.

108
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:17,814
- Bolin can land a shot.
- I can?

109
00:08:17,816 --> 00:08:19,919
You have to take her out
right before we drop down.

110
00:08:20,518 --> 00:08:21,768
I do?

111
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:29,917
Open the hatch.

112
00:08:33,482 --> 00:08:35,398
If we get in trouble,
metalbend us up.

113
00:08:35,607 --> 00:08:36,366
We're in position.

114
00:08:36,368 --> 00:08:38,996
Copy that.
It's Bolin time.

115
00:08:40,205 --> 00:08:44,624
All right.
Bolin time. Bolin time!

116
00:08:54,852 --> 00:08:56,875
I can't get a clean shot!

117
00:08:57,555 --> 00:08:58,703
You have to!

118
00:08:59,024 --> 00:09:00,650
- Are we a go?
- No go.

119
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:03,998
- Copy that. We're a go.
- I said no! Wait!

120
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:17,706
Bolin, take the shot!

121
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:28,636
Nice job, little bro.

122
00:09:50,741 --> 00:09:51,732
No!

123
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:16,517
Thanks.

124
00:10:20,304 --> 00:10:21,488
We failed!

125
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:35,184
Where did they go?

126
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,428
They can't be far.

127
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:39,263
Guards,
search the entire estate.

128
00:10:45,288 --> 00:10:47,835
This should neutralize
the Shirashu toxins.

129
00:10:51,645 --> 00:10:53,083
How could you let this happen?

130
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:56,207
You assured me this was one of the
most secure places in the world.

131
00:10:56,408 --> 00:10:58,791
It is. I don't know
how this happened.

132
00:10:58,793 --> 00:11:00,626
Obviously this was
a wellplanned operation,

133
00:11:00,628 --> 00:11:02,015
so don't blame me.

134
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,748
We searched the entire estate.
But there's no sign of them.

135
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,103
Well, keep looking!

136
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:11,646
It would seem they had
some inside knowledge of Zaofu.

137
00:11:11,923 --> 00:11:13,817
They must have been
working with someone.

138
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,815
The..the guards. It had
to be one of them.

139
00:11:19,147 --> 00:11:21,011
- I agree.
- Question them all!

140
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:24,229
Whoever betrayed my city
will suffer the consequences!

141
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:30,942
What is your full name?

142
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:33,368
Where were you last night?

143
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,445
Do you have any knowledge

144
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:37,730
of the people who tried
to kidnap the Avatar?

145
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,282
My name is Xu Quan.

146
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:42,285
I was patrolling the south
wall of the Beifong estates.

147
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:43,836
I have absolutely
no knowledge

148
00:11:43,838 --> 00:11:46,097
of the people
that tried to kidnap Korra.

149
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,129
What was I doing last night?
Same thing I always do.

150
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:55,965
From 9:00 to 10:00,
I checked my body for ticks.

151
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:58,184
Lyme disease
is a serious killer.

152
00:11:58,186 --> 00:12:00,636
Then I did my nightly
varricalisthenics

153
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:02,772
followed by 30 minutes
of breath holding.

154
00:12:02,774 --> 00:12:05,024
I filmed the whole thing
if you want to watch it.

155
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:07,456
That won't be necessary.

156
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:13,149
Maybe it wasn't
a guard after all.

157
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:15,952
Maybe it was someone a little
higher up the food chain.

158
00:12:15,954 --> 00:12:18,278
Aiwei, why don't you
question Su?

159
00:12:18,373 --> 00:12:20,957
Lin, stop.
Your sister wasn't involved.

160
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,286
No, I'll gladly be questioned.
I have nothing to hide.

161
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:29,298
What is your full name?

162
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,300
Suyin Beifong.

163
00:12:31,302 --> 00:12:34,053
I'm the daughter of Toph
and the only sister to Lin,

164
00:12:34,055 --> 00:12:36,639
and I had nothing to do
with the attack last night.

165
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,964
- She is telling the truth.
- Argh!

166
00:12:38,985 --> 00:12:41,993
This is a waste of time. Just
bring in the next guard.

167
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:48,317
Give me your name
and tell me where you are from.

168
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:51,404
I'm Hong Li. I was born
and raised here in Zaofu.

169
00:12:51,406 --> 00:12:53,022
Do you have any knowledge

170
00:12:53,043 --> 00:12:55,544
of the people who tried
to kidnap the Avatar?

171
00:12:56,181 --> 00:12:56,687
No.

172
00:12:59,164 --> 00:13:02,915
Did you help the attackers
enter Zaofu last night?

173
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,461
No, of course not.

174
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:06,669
You're lying.

175
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:08,265
What? No, I'm not!

176
00:13:08,873 --> 00:13:11,674
How did they get in and out?
Where are they now?

177
00:13:11,676 --> 00:13:14,210
I don't know! I'm telling you,
I didn't help them.

178
00:13:14,212 --> 00:13:16,401
You're a traitor
to the entire clan.

179
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:18,895
I suggest we search his place.

180
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:36,949
I got something.

181
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:37,635
What?

182
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,369
It looks like it's from them.

183
00:13:40,371 --> 00:13:43,289
"Team assembled.
Ready to rendezvous."

184
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,756
And look at this.

185
00:13:46,628 --> 00:13:48,911
These are the guards'
log books.

186
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:51,714
All their schedules
and routes are in here.

187
00:13:51,716 --> 00:13:54,750
That guard knows everything.
We have to get him to talk.

188
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:56,886
Let's go confront him
with this evidence right now.

189
00:13:56,888 --> 00:13:57,725
No.

190
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:01,329
Let's give him a little time
to sweat it out.

191
00:14:01,593 --> 00:14:03,352
He will talk eventually.

192
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,318
I don't understand why we're not
talking to that guard right now.

193
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:14,437
Every minute we waste here,
those guys get further away.

194
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:16,606
I mean, how does a random guard

195
00:14:16,608 --> 00:14:18,658
get involved with a group
of super criminals, anyway?

196
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,109
What do you mean?

197
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:22,111
That guard is only
18 years old,

198
00:14:22,113 --> 00:14:24,614
and has lived in Zaofu
his entire life.

199
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:28,167
Zaheer and his gang have been in
prison for more than 13 years.

200
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:30,336
I don't know,
but we all saw the evidence.

201
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:31,787
It's pretty overwhelming.

202
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:32,955
Maybe a little
too overwhelming?

203
00:14:34,175 --> 00:14:36,792
Hey, varrick.
What are you doing here?

204
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:39,095
Collecting pumice stones
with Zhuli.

205
00:14:39,097 --> 00:14:40,963
That lavabender
did a lot of damage.

206
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:43,633
But he makes a nice
exfoliating rock.

207
00:14:43,635 --> 00:14:45,635
And when you got
calluses like mine,

208
00:14:45,637 --> 00:14:48,187
you take all the pumice stones
you can get your hands on.

209
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:49,868
Or in my case, feet!

210
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:53,063
Ehh...

211
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:55,811
What were you saying
about the evidence?

212
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:59,815
I was saying that I can smell
a conspiracy when I see one.

213
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:01,701
Look, if I was trying
to set someone up,

214
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:03,452
I would tell everyone
he's guilty,

215
00:15:03,454 --> 00:15:06,155
and then plant the evidence
in his apartment as proof.

216
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:09,104
Oh, you mean exactly like
what you did to me?

217
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,559
Yes! Just like that.
Remember how great that worked?

218
00:15:13,464 --> 00:15:15,631
Well, not for you.

219
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:16,523
You're right.

220
00:15:16,884 --> 00:15:18,968
All the evidence
points to this guard,

221
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,636
but maybe he's just
the fall guy.

222
00:15:20,638 --> 00:15:21,590
But for who?

223
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,342
For the only person who can truly
keep a secret in this city, Aiwei.

224
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:41,023
He's not home.
Or he's hiding in there.

225
00:15:41,716 --> 00:15:43,629
Or he's invisible.

226
00:15:45,162 --> 00:15:46,696
Probably just not home.

227
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:48,664
We have to get in there
and find some evidence

228
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:52,585
that links Aiwei to Zaheer,
otherwise Su won't believe us.

229
00:15:59,516 --> 00:16:00,933
It's just an empty book.

230
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,722
Oh, it's like
a desert on a jar.

231
00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:14,523
Bolin, put that back.

232
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:16,025
We don't want Aiwei to know

233
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:17,753
we were in here
if we can't find anything.

234
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,062
Uh...

235
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:22,291
You forgot where it goes,
didn't you?

236
00:16:26,703 --> 00:16:28,371
Look at these scuff marks.

237
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:30,967
I think this bookshelf
slides open.

238
00:16:40,108 --> 00:16:41,250
What do you think
is down there?

239
00:16:41,252 --> 00:16:42,635
Could be a storage cellar.

240
00:16:42,637 --> 00:16:45,554
Or it could be
how Zaheer got in and out.

241
00:16:45,556 --> 00:16:47,762
Aiwei's coming back.
Quick!

242
00:16:54,526 --> 00:16:56,750
What are you doing
in my house?

243
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:02,158
you are trespassing
on the property

244
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:04,597
of one of the highestranked
officials in the city.

245
00:17:04,797 --> 00:17:06,726
You had better have
a good explanation.

246
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,011
We do, we do.

247
00:17:08,013 --> 00:17:09,513
We actually knocked
on your front door,

248
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:11,114
and we thought
we heard you say...

249
00:17:11,116 --> 00:17:14,580
"Come in! I'm in the bathroom!"

250
00:17:16,172 --> 00:17:17,454
I don't even know
why I'm saying that.

251
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:19,823
You know I'm lying. And you
don't even sound like that.

252
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:22,359
We came here because things
weren't adding up,

253
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:24,578
and we thought you might
have some answers.

254
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:26,264
Sit.

255
00:17:27,016 --> 00:17:30,434
If you want to talk,
let's talk over some tea.

256
00:17:36,114 --> 00:17:39,729
So, what is not adding up,
exactly?

257
00:17:39,877 --> 00:17:41,704
Hong Li was clearly lying,

258
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:44,022
and we found evidence
in his apartment.

259
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,317
But don't you think
it's weird how young he is?

260
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:49,652
How did he ever get
mixed up with this group?

261
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:53,189
Perhaps through a relative.
Or maybe he was bribed.

262
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:55,854
We will find out
those answers in time.

263
00:17:56,528 --> 00:18:00,491
But if it wasn't him,
who do you think it was?

264
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:03,997
We don't know.

265
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:06,536
You don't think
I had something

266
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:07,875
to do with this, do you?

267
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:11,118
We're just
looking for answers.

268
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:14,412
And you think
you found something, don't you?

269
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:21,729
You have no idea
what is coming for you, Avatar.

270
00:18:28,944 --> 00:18:30,893
Come on!
He's getting away!

271
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:33,651
I'm still a little new
at this, so back off!

272
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:03,686
Argh!

273
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:10,789
He's gone.
Look.

274
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:12,928
He must've escaped
through there.

275
00:19:13,092 --> 00:19:14,328
Help me clear it out.

276
00:19:17,582 --> 00:19:18,574
What happened?

277
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:20,943
- We heard an explosion.
- Where is Aiwei?

278
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:23,613
Your trusted advisor
was the one who betrayed us.

279
00:19:23,615 --> 00:19:25,829
- He was lying about the guard.
- What?

280
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:27,334
No.

281
00:19:27,596 --> 00:19:29,580
We confronted him
and he bolted through here.

282
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:37,760
He must have collapsed
the tunnel behind him.

283
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:40,129
And he rigged an explosion
to destroy any evidence

284
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:41,035
that might have been here.

285
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:44,267
This is where Zaheer
got in and out.

286
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:45,935
Aiwei was the traitor.

287
00:19:45,937 --> 00:19:46,569
I...

288
00:19:47,806 --> 00:19:49,062
Trusted him.

289
00:19:49,641 --> 00:19:51,853
- Is everyone okay?
- Aiwei is a fugitive.

290
00:19:52,277 --> 00:19:54,861
Get all available guards
to search the mountainside.

291
00:19:54,863 --> 00:19:56,917
And find out where
this tunnel exits immediately!

292
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,992
What did you find?

293
00:20:09,994 --> 00:20:11,327
We located
the end of the tunnel,

294
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:12,712
but there's no sign of him.

295
00:20:12,714 --> 00:20:14,297
Just some fresh tire tracks.

296
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:16,833
He had an escape plan
all ready to go.

297
00:20:16,835 --> 00:20:19,052
I trusted him with my life.

298
00:20:19,054 --> 00:20:22,010
I thought we were family,
but it was all a lie.

299
00:20:22,507 --> 00:20:26,298
Whoever these guys are, they're
more powerful than we thought.

300
00:20:26,394 --> 00:20:27,894
And more dangerous.

301
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:29,562
That's why
we have to find them.

302
00:20:29,564 --> 00:20:31,564
We're going to hold off
our search for airbenders

303
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:32,755
and hunt down Aiwei.

304
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:34,517
Naga can track his scent.

305
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:36,986
And I bet if we find Aiwei
we'll find Zaheer.

306
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:39,182
No. We're not hunting this group.

307
00:20:39,386 --> 00:20:40,930
There could be
other secret agents

308
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:42,927
in other parts of the world
looking for you right now.

309
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:45,395
I'm taking you back to Republic
City where I can protect you.

310
00:20:45,397 --> 00:20:47,564
If I wasn't safe here,
then I'm not safe anywhere.

311
00:20:47,566 --> 00:20:49,199
I have to stop them.

312
00:20:49,201 --> 00:20:51,201
It's too dangerous.
You are not going!

313
00:20:51,203 --> 00:20:54,537
Stop trying to protect me.
I'm the Avatar. This is my job!

314
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,206
Don't lecture me about jobs!

315
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,875
Enough. Korra, listen to Lin.

316
00:20:58,877 --> 00:21:00,743
But.... they...

317
00:21:00,745 --> 00:21:03,580
please. Lin's only looking out for you.

318
00:21:03,582 --> 00:21:06,416
I promise you Aiwei
and everyone he's working with

319
00:21:06,418 --> 00:21:08,145
will be brought to justice.

320
00:21:09,316 --> 00:21:11,921
Fine. If you really think it's best.

321
00:21:11,923 --> 00:21:13,089
I do.

322
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:14,591
Thank you, Su.

323
00:21:14,593 --> 00:21:16,559
Everyone should
get some rest tonight.

324
00:21:16,561 --> 00:21:18,261
I'll have my people
prep your airship

325
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:20,249
and you can leave
first thing in the morning.

326
00:21:30,928 --> 00:21:31,953
Su.

327
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,993
You really think
Naga could track Aiwei?

328
00:21:33,995 --> 00:21:35,945
- Definitely.
- Then here.

329
00:21:35,947 --> 00:21:38,462
There's a jeep packed
with supplies by the east gate.

330
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:40,283
It's all gassed up
and ready to go.

331
00:21:40,485 --> 00:21:42,118
What? Why?

332
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,653
Because I want you
to hunt down Aiwei

333
00:21:43,655 --> 00:21:45,038
and bring him back to me.

334
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:46,322
But you said

335
00:21:46,324 --> 00:21:47,657
I said what
lin wanted to hear,

336
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:49,292
and I bought you guys some time.

337
00:21:49,494 --> 00:21:52,182
Go. I'll deal with Lin
in the morning.

338
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:55,089
Let's get this guy.

339
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:57,981
Thanks.

340
00:22:06,856 --> 00:22:11,114
