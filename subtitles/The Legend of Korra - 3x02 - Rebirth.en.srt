1
00:00:00,663 --> 00:00:02,223
Earth.

2
00:00:02,225 --> 00:00:03,925
Fire.

3
00:00:03,927 --> 00:00:05,460
Air.

4
00:00:05,462 --> 00:00:07,662
Water.

5
00:00:07,664 --> 00:00:11,900
Only the Avatar can master all four elements

6
00:00:11,902 --> 00:00:14,636
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:19,908

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,043
The world has entered a new age.

9
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:24,279
Harmonic convergence created an energy shift

10
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:27,215
the likes of which has
never been felt before.

11
00:00:27,217 --> 00:00:28,516
And after two weeks,

12
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:29,918
Republic City continues to recover

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,454
from Korra's epic battle with Unavaatu.

14
00:00:32,456 --> 00:00:34,389
Vines have sprouted up all over,

15
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:35,624
creating pockets of wilds

16
00:00:35,626 --> 00:00:37,525
the spirits have come to call home.

17
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:39,794
What other changes are
in store for our city?

18
00:00:50,374 --> 00:00:51,606
Come back, Bum-Ju.

19
00:00:56,613 --> 00:00:58,780
If you don't wanna wear
the sweater I made you,

20
00:00:58,782 --> 00:01:00,081
that's fine.

21
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,150
I'm sorry I got mad.

22
00:01:04,388 --> 00:01:07,022
Bum-Ju, I'm running out of tree.

23
00:01:07,024 --> 00:01:10,892
Can we go down now?

24
00:01:13,363 --> 00:01:15,664
Bum-Ju, a little help?

25
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:18,600
Ah! Ahh!

26
00:01:27,277 --> 00:01:28,710
Look!

27
00:01:28,712 --> 00:01:31,646
I'm airbending.

28
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,048
Ah!

29
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,884
Wow, that still hurt a lot.

30
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:52,300
How are we ever gonna
clear away all these vines?

31
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,045
I don't get it!

32
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:07,315
I can vanquish Vaatu,
but not a bunch of stupid vines?

33
00:02:07,317 --> 00:02:09,551
I'm sure you'll find a way.

34
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:11,019
Why do you wanna get rid of them?

35
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:13,088
You changed the world.

36
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,123
We're connected with the spirits again.

37
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,958
The wilds are their home.

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,761
I don't think the people
who used to live here

39
00:02:18,762 --> 00:02:21,362
are as excited about it as you are.

40
00:02:27,603 --> 00:02:29,938
I gotta go face the press and tell them

41
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,207
I still don't have a way
to get rid of the vines.

42
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:34,042
This should be fun.

43
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,447
Mr. President,

44
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:41,716
are you concerned that your approval ratings

45
00:02:41,718 --> 00:02:44,552
are now nearly as low as the Avatar's?

46
00:02:44,554 --> 00:02:46,254
Have you seen today's headline?

47
00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:50,892
It says, "Raik-oh-no. Polls pan Prez plans!"

48
00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:53,695
I'm not concerned with snappy
put-downs in the press.

49
00:02:53,697 --> 00:02:56,731
I'm facing this calamity just
like every other citizen.

50
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:59,200
There's a tree growing
right through my office.

51
00:02:59,202 --> 00:03:00,869
You think I'm not doing everything I can

52
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:02,337
to get rid of it?

53
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,741
- A few questions, please!
- Avatar Korra!

54
00:03:06,743 --> 00:03:09,110
Do you regret the way you
handled the Unalaq crisis?

55
00:03:09,112 --> 00:03:11,412
Why are you forcing the
integration of spirits

56
00:03:11,414 --> 00:03:12,914
in Republic City?

57
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,216
Listen,
I've been trying everything I can think of

58
00:03:15,218 --> 00:03:16,684
to get rid of these vines, but...

59
00:03:16,686 --> 00:03:19,154
- why can't you fix this?
- Are the vines here to stay?

60
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:21,489
Is this part of your new world order?

61
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:22,791
Look!

62
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:25,293
Harmonic convergence was
just a couple weeks ago.

63
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:26,995
I just need a little more time

64
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:28,730
to get everything back to normal.

65
00:03:28,732 --> 00:03:32,100
The Avatar has put us all in
a very difficult position,

66
00:03:32,102 --> 00:03:34,002
- but my administration...
- Oh!

67
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:35,170
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:36,671
Did I put you in a difficult position

69
00:03:36,673 --> 00:03:39,073
by fighting the giant force of pure evil

70
00:03:39,075 --> 00:03:41,309
that was going to destroy the whole world?

71
00:03:41,311 --> 00:03:44,145
Maybe your administration
could've handled that!

72
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:45,814
That's all! No more questions!

73
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,786
This is a disaster.

74
00:03:51,788 --> 00:03:53,721
Don't worry. We'll figure something out.

75
00:03:53,723 --> 00:03:55,323
Easy for you to say.

76
00:03:55,325 --> 00:03:57,358
You don't have my poll numbers.

77
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,460
8% approval?

78
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:00,762
Who were they asking?

79
00:04:00,764 --> 00:04:02,130
You can't take that to heart.

80
00:04:02,132 --> 00:04:03,431
People are just frustrated.

81
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:04,933
I don't blame them.

82
00:04:04,935 --> 00:04:06,835
I should be able to fix this.

83
00:04:06,837 --> 00:04:08,837
I'm the Avatar.

84
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,677
You are not gonna believe
what just happened.

85
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,645
Where's your father?

86
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:19,781
Dad!

87
00:04:19,783 --> 00:04:22,350
What is it? What's wrong?

88
00:04:22,352 --> 00:04:26,821
The most amazing, wondrous,
fantastical thing just occurred.

89
00:04:26,823 --> 00:04:28,790
Okay, Bum-Ju and I had a little fight.

90
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:30,825
I made him this sweater,
and he didn't seem to like it.

91
00:04:30,827 --> 00:04:32,427
And I'll admit it might need work,

92
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:34,562
but it was my first attempt at knitting.

93
00:04:34,564 --> 00:04:36,264
So I was a little hurt.

94
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:38,333
Hilarious.

95
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:40,235
Time for dinner, everyone.

96
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:42,871
No! Check this out.

97
00:04:42,873 --> 00:04:45,440
I can airbend!

98
00:04:47,878 --> 00:04:49,911
Yeah, wait. Seriously. I was doing it.

99
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:53,281
Oh, hold on. I just...

100
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:55,016
Maybe if I...

101
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:56,184
No.

102
00:04:56,186 --> 00:04:59,821
I swear I'm not making it up.

103
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:05,627
Stop waving your arms around at the table.

104
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:07,128
It's not funny anymore.

105
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,030
It's not a joke.

106
00:05:09,032 --> 00:05:10,565
What's up with him?

107
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:12,834
Bumi says he airbended earlier,

108
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:14,235
but he can't now.

109
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:16,070
Oh, and I guess he's not
very good at knitting either.

110
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:19,007
I gotta say,
I love being a part of this family.

111
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:21,109
You got the grumpy dad, the wacky Uncle.

112
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:23,044
The put-upon mom, crazy kids.

113
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:25,780
This is great. Where's Mako?

114
00:05:25,782 --> 00:05:27,815
Oh, you mean the brooding teenager?

115
00:05:27,817 --> 00:05:29,651
He's staying at the police station.

116
00:05:29,653 --> 00:05:30,818
Still?

117
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,620
I told him Tenzin invited us to stay here

118
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:34,856
since our apartment is a vine habitat now,

119
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:37,692
but he said he had to focus on work.

120
00:05:40,664 --> 00:05:42,330
Oh! Did you see that?

121
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:43,865
I think the napkin moved.

122
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:45,233
You blew on it.

123
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:46,534
Wait!

124
00:05:46,536 --> 00:05:49,704
Maybe I can only do it
when my life is in danger.

125
00:05:49,706 --> 00:05:53,141
Bolin, bend a giant boulder at me.

126
00:05:53,143 --> 00:05:55,410
Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.

127
00:05:55,412 --> 00:05:57,111
If you're gonna be bending giant boulders,

128
00:05:57,113 --> 00:05:58,413
you can do it outside.

129
00:05:58,415 --> 00:06:00,348
No one is bending giant boulders!

130
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,183
Look alive, Uncle Bumi!

131
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:05,219
Ah!

132
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:10,825
I told you!

133
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:15,196
Unbelievable.

134
00:06:15,198 --> 00:06:16,931
You're actually an airbender.

135
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:21,402
Wait until I tell mom.
She's gonna love this.

136
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:31,338
Ow!

137
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,711
Police.

138
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:41,248
He what? Slow down.

139
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,550
Okay, I'm on my way.

140
00:06:47,122 --> 00:06:49,223
What the heck did all this?

141
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:52,226
It was my brother. He's out of control!

142
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:54,361
Okay, just tell me what happened.

143
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:56,330
We were arguing about the books,

144
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,365
and Daw was yelling at me,

145
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:00,801
and all of a sudden things
started flying around!

146
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:02,903
He was creating this storm like...

147
00:07:02,905 --> 00:07:04,238
Like what?

148
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,006
Well, like he was airbending.

149
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:09,910
Sir... That's impossible.

150
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:12,479
There are only five airbenders
in the entire world,

151
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:14,615
and your brother is not one of them.

152
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:15,916
I know what I saw.

153
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:18,786
He was freaking out, yelling,
"what happening to me?"

154
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:20,821
Then, he ran into the back room

155
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:24,925
and locked himself in.

156
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,561
Police. Open up.

157
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:29,229
Go away!

158
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:32,499
Get out here, sir,
or I'm knocking this door down.

159
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:34,368
One...

160
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,702
Two...

161
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:40,574
Ah! I'm so sorry!

162
00:07:45,347 --> 00:07:48,582
I told you! Airbending!

163
00:07:52,455 --> 00:07:56,056
Ugh! I can't figure this thing out!

164
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,891
Do you think being in the spirit world

165
00:07:57,893 --> 00:07:59,393
during harmonic convergence

166
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,727
could've given him bending?

167
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:02,596
I suppose it's possible.

168
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:05,065
Maybe Uncle Bumi is just a late bloomer.

169
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:09,002
I have been noticing a
change in your aura lately.

170
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:11,638
And you didn't tell me?

171
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:19,513
Invisible spirit monster attack?

172
00:08:19,515 --> 00:08:21,415
Lin! You won't believe this.

173
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,651
Bumi just started airbending.

174
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:26,520
I'm afraid he's not the only one.

175
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:27,721
What?

176
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:29,323
I got a call last night

177
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:32,092
about a guy who just started
airbending out of nowhere.

178
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,895
You mean there's another one?
Where is he now?

179
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:38,332
He... Blew a door down on me and got away.

180
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:40,901
We've got an all-points
bulletin out on him right now.

181
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:42,836
Wait, we'll help you look for him.

182
00:08:42,838 --> 00:08:44,204
Where should we start?

183
00:08:44,206 --> 00:08:46,306
Oh, well, you know, you should...

184
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:47,808
You should leave it to the police.

185
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,910
It's... Police business, you know.

186
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:53,514
It's, um... Official.

187
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:54,948
Okay.

188
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,617
How are you doing?

189
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,118
You know you're welcome to stay here

190
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,020
instead of sleeping at the police station.

191
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:03,257
No, I'm fine.

192
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:06,360
I should just get... Going.

193
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:08,662
So!

194
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:10,697
As you were...

195
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:12,633
Ladies.

196
00:09:17,272 --> 00:09:19,239
This is so exciting!

197
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:20,641
New airbenders in the city?

198
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,944
I bet we can find that guy before Mako does.

199
00:09:23,946 --> 00:09:25,979
You know I'm not very good at this.

200
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:29,149
You're the Avatar,
master of all the elements.

201
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,951
You should know how to drive.

202
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:33,487
Besides, it's relaxing.

203
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,423
Clutch! Clutch!

204
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:38,825
Ugh! Ah! Ugh!

205
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:42,596
That's the brake.

206
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:45,065
Let's try again. You ready?

207
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:50,370
How long do you think talking to Mako

208
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:52,272
is going to be like pulling teeth?

209
00:09:52,274 --> 00:09:53,907
Well, Mako has never been

210
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:56,777
the most "in touch with his feelings" guy.

211
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:59,112
But it'll get better eventually.

212
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:01,114
So when I was gone,

213
00:10:01,116 --> 00:10:02,616
did he tell you that we broke up?

214
00:10:02,618 --> 00:10:05,485
Yeah. We all knew.

215
00:10:05,487 --> 00:10:06,920
Sorry.

216
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:08,288
That's pretty embarrassing.

217
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,657
Actually,
I need to tell you something about that,

218
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:12,693
and I should've told you this sooner,

219
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,862
but... While you were gone,

220
00:10:15,864 --> 00:10:18,966
I...Kind of... Kissed him.

221
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:20,300
I'm sorry.

222
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,670
No wonder he's so nervous around us.

223
00:10:23,672 --> 00:10:25,672
- You're not mad?
- No!

224
00:10:25,674 --> 00:10:28,342
I mean, I kissed Mako when he
was going out with you, so.

225
00:10:28,344 --> 00:10:29,676
You what?

226
00:10:29,678 --> 00:10:31,578
I'm so sorry! I thought you knew!

227
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,514
I'm just kidding. I knew a long time ago.

228
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:37,217
Well, whatever happened with Mako

229
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,885
I'm glad it hasn't come between us.

230
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:40,787
I've never had a girlfriend to hang out with

231
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:42,356
and talk to before,

232
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:43,890
except for Naga.

233
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:45,359
This is nice.

234
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:46,860
Vine! Vine!

235
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:54,701
Hey! Watch where you're going!

236
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:56,303
What are you doing living
in the middle of the road

237
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:57,704
in the first place?

238
00:10:57,706 --> 00:10:59,206
Don't ask me, Avatar.

239
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,641
You made the world this way.

240
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:02,009
We're just living in it.

241
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:04,277
Look, I don't have anything against spirits,

242
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:06,279
but these vines are causing major problems

243
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:07,681
all over the city.

244
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:09,850
Spirits? Vines?

245
00:11:09,852 --> 00:11:11,318
We're all the same.

246
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,454
Seems like the Avatar would know that.

247
00:11:16,357 --> 00:11:19,059
Korra, you okay?

248
00:11:19,061 --> 00:11:21,128
I think that spirit just gave me an idea

249
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,963
how to get rid of these vines.

250
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:25,465
But I'm gonna need a lot of water.

251
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:29,703
It's like a dream, dad.

252
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:33,507
After 170 years, new airbenders.

253
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:35,676
Dad?

254
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:37,244
When a new guy gets airbending,

255
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:38,912
does that make him our brother?

256
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:42,015
Well, in a way,
all airbenders are our family.

257
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:43,483
Does that mean I have to share my room?

258
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,252
Because I like my personal space.

259
00:11:45,254 --> 00:11:47,054
Of course not.

260
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:48,522
But we might have to get used

261
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:51,158
to not being the only
airbenders around any more.

262
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,361
I hope we have enough for an army.

263
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:57,164
I wanna be a commander like Uncle Bumi.

264
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,466
Air nomads don't have armies, Meelo.

265
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:03,036
But maybe there will be enough
to fill the temples again.

266
00:12:03,038 --> 00:12:04,938
What's wrong, daddy?

267
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,175
I just wish your grandfather
were here to see this.

268
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:10,610
Will you be airbender president?

269
00:12:10,612 --> 00:12:11,912
No.

270
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:13,380
But I think the new airbenders

271
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:14,815
will need lots of help and guidance

272
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,485
to understand what it means
to be a part of our nation.

273
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,554
That's a big responsibility.

274
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:22,656
Don't worry, dad. We'll help you.

275
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,928
I know you will.

276
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:36,503
I hope this works.

277
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,338
What are you guys doing here?

278
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,340
I was alerted that you had a new plan

279
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,309
to wipe out these noxious weeds,

280
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:45,145
so I thought you'd want
everyone to be here to watch.

281
00:12:45,147 --> 00:12:46,346
Avatar Korra!

282
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,181
Do you really think... No questions!

283
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:51,551
Just stand there. Silently!

284
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:41,935
Go in peace.

285
00:13:41,937 --> 00:13:43,737
How did you know what to do?

286
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,205
Will you send the spirits away now?

287
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:47,607
How soon can we expect public
water service to resume?

288
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,890
Look out!

289
00:14:14,702 --> 00:14:16,536
Let's go, people. Hurry!

290
00:14:27,248 --> 00:14:30,483
Hang on!

291
00:14:48,135 --> 00:14:50,136
I think that could've gone better.

292
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:58,389
Can't talk. Meditating.

293
00:14:58,771 --> 00:15:02,043
You must be at the end of your rope.
You hate meditating.

294
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:04,291
I thought that if I really tried,

295
00:15:04,316 --> 00:15:06,918
I might be able to contact
my past Avatars.

296
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:09,640
Someone who knows something
to help me.

297
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:10,622
But I can't.

298
00:15:11,156 --> 00:15:13,389
They're gone and I'm all alone.

299
00:15:15,154 --> 00:15:18,163
Did I ruin everything by leaving
the spirit portals open?

300
00:15:18,578 --> 00:15:20,705
You didn't ruin anything.

301
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:22,982
You did what you thought was best
for the world.

302
00:15:23,395 --> 00:15:25,435
And now things have changed.

303
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,825
Change can be good or bad,

304
00:15:27,856 --> 00:15:29,470
depending on your point of view.

305
00:15:30,783 --> 00:15:32,822
I know the people's point of view.

306
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:35,456
- It's bad.
- You're not the president, Korra.

307
00:15:36,052 --> 00:15:38,098
Your job isn't to fix the daily problems

308
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:40,294
of every person in Republic City.

309
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:45,111
Your responsibility is to bring balance
to the entire world.

310
00:15:45,342 --> 00:15:47,087
And that means no matter
what you do,

311
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,727
some people are not going to be
happy about it.

312
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:50,653
Great.

313
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:53,838
On the other hand, some people will be
very happy,

314
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:55,052
like me.

315
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:57,793
What you did during Harmonic Convergence,

316
00:15:57,812 --> 00:15:59,614
may have brought back the Air Nation.

317
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:02,604
And that can only be good for
restoring balance.

318
00:16:02,881 --> 00:16:05,834
That is the act of a great Avatar.

319
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:07,173
It's scary.

320
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:10,828
I have all this power and all these
people depending on me,

321
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,512
but I don't know what I'm supposed
to be doing half the time.

322
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,972
It seems like I should be wiser.

323
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,759
True wisdom begins when we accept
things as they are.

324
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,986
You started a new age Korra,

325
00:16:23,005 --> 00:16:25,138
there's no going back to the past.

326
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:28,129
Mako called, the cops found
the new airbender guy.

327
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,255
But when they try to bring him in,

328
00:16:29,274 --> 00:16:31,470
he ran away and climbed to the top
of Kyoshi bridge

329
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:32,540
and he won't come down.

330
00:16:33,296 --> 00:16:36,099
Uh... Sorry, did I interrupt an Avatar
wisdom session?

331
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,909
Avatar wisdom is a thing
of the past, Bolin. Come on.

332
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:41,079
Oh. Okay.

333
00:16:41,562 --> 00:16:42,488
Is that a good thing?

334
00:16:42,688 --> 00:16:44,140
Depends who you ask.

335
00:16:55,956 --> 00:16:59,115
Come down immediately or we will be forced
to take action.

336
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,416
Stay back! I'm dangerous.

337
00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:12,065
Sorry!

338
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:29,019
Don't panic. I'm just here to talk.

339
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:32,960
Please, I don't know what I'm doing
and I don't wanna hurt anyone.

340
00:17:33,342 --> 00:17:35,982
Tell me about it. Rough day, huh?

341
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:37,929
I'm having kind of a rough day myself.

342
00:17:37,992 --> 00:17:39,587
You mind if I sit down here?

343
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:42,690
- No.
- I know you're scared.

344
00:17:42,878 --> 00:17:46,507
You've gone through a big change and
it's kind of my fault.

345
00:17:47,384 --> 00:17:50,850
But you're not alone. There are other
airbenders and they want to help you.

346
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,253
Actually, they're really excited to meet you.

347
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:55,405
I don't want to be an airbender.

348
00:17:55,438 --> 00:17:58,235
Please, you're the Avatar, make it stop.

349
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,769
I'm sorry, I can't.

350
00:18:02,173 --> 00:18:04,275
But I promise you, things will get better

351
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,739
if you just give it a chance.

352
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:09,599
Let me take you over to Air Temple Island
and we can talk this through,

353
00:18:09,612 --> 00:18:10,519
okay?

354
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:31,359
Daw, this is Tenzin.
He's going to help you.

355
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:34,537
It is absolutely my pleasure
to meet you, Daw.

356
00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:37,417
I've never met a new airbender before.

357
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:40,445
Well, at least not one whose diaper
I didn't have to change.

358
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:42,554
Actually I just fell off a bridge

359
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,251
so I could use a fresh diaper
right about now.

360
00:18:46,496 --> 00:18:48,016
So is this the deal,

361
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:51,377
we have a crisis every other day now
thanks to you?

362
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:54,531
Listen, I know you're having a tough time
getting used to these changes

363
00:18:54,556 --> 00:18:55,857
and I'm sorry for that.

364
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,323
But you and everyone else are gonna
have to learn to live with it.

365
00:18:59,781 --> 00:19:02,453
The vines and the spirits are here to stay.

366
00:19:02,747 --> 00:19:04,417
Well, you know who's not here to stay?

367
00:19:04,461 --> 00:19:06,576
You! I order you to leave this city.

368
00:19:06,696 --> 00:19:08,883
You've caused nothing but trouble
since you arrived.

369
00:19:12,474 --> 00:19:15,021
Don't worry, I was already leaving.

370
00:19:21,808 --> 00:19:23,628
I can see my path now.

371
00:19:23,653 --> 00:19:25,945
There are new airbenders out there and
I'm gonna find them

372
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:27,540
and rebuild the Air Nation.

373
00:19:27,771 --> 00:19:31,056
Don't think I'm not going with you.
It's so exciting.

374
00:19:31,231 --> 00:19:33,152
Who knows who's out there right now,

375
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:36,341
discovering the gift of airbending for
the first time.

376
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:05,884
You know the drills are here?

377
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,009
Of course.

378
00:20:10,012 --> 00:20:11,607
I hope you still like rice.

379
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:16,739
Have you ever read the poetry of
the great airbending guru, Lahima?

380
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:17,598
What?

381
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:22,635
Guru Lahima lived 4000 years ago
in the Northern Air Temple.

382
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,869
It is said that he unlocked the secret of
weightlessness

383
00:20:25,907 --> 00:20:27,840
and became untethered from the earth,

384
00:20:28,115 --> 00:20:31,744
living his final 40 years without ever
touching the ground.

385
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:33,778
Is that how you plan to escape,

386
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:36,989
with something you picked up
from an old airbender children's story?

387
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:41,444
Like all great children's tales,
it contains truth within the myth.

388
00:20:41,732 --> 00:20:44,816
Lahima once wrote, instinct is a lie,

389
00:20:44,862 --> 00:20:48,416
told by a fearful body hoping to be wrong.

390
00:20:48,536 --> 00:20:49,973
What's that supposed to mean?

391
00:20:50,036 --> 00:20:54,411
It means that when you base your
expectations only on what you see,

392
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:58,947
you blind yourself to the possibilities
of a new reality.

393
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:09,203
Unh unh unh, you wouldn't want to singe
your friend, would you?

394
00:21:09,254 --> 00:21:10,624
How?

395
00:21:10,643 --> 00:21:12,582
You're not a bender.

396
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,348
Nature is constantly changing,

397
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:16,987
like the wind.

398
00:21:45,426 --> 00:21:47,747
Now you might wanna ration that
bowl of rice.

399
00:21:48,335 --> 00:21:51,182
You've got 3 weeks until
the next shift change.

400
00:21:51,855 --> 00:21:53,713
It's the dawning of a new age.

401
00:21:53,957 --> 00:21:58,989
The end of the White Lotus and soon,
the end of the Avatar.

402
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:11,004

403
00:22:11,217 --> 00:22:14,883
__

404
00:22:34,074 --> 00:22:37,271
Did someone order a fully-equipped
Future Industries airship?

405
00:22:37,812 --> 00:22:38,600
It's perfect.

406
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,689
Thanks, Asami.

407
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,981
I figured if we're going to Ba Sing Se
to search for airbenders,

408
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:44,477
 we should do it in style.

409
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:45,985
Yay, airship!

410
00:22:46,254 --> 00:22:48,431
- I want to see.
- Come on, Moki.

411
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,671
While you guys are gone, Pema and I
will hold down the fort.

412
00:22:53,992 --> 00:22:56,538
Who's excited to spend some time
with your Auntie Kya?

413
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:58,690
Ew!

414
00:22:59,241 --> 00:23:01,437
Aww. He likes you.

415
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,773
Mako, I'm so glad you're here.

416
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,809
Of course Korra... Avatar.
Avatar Korra.

417
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:17,802
Once I received your message, I proceeded to
contact various locations

418
00:23:17,827 --> 00:23:21,625
within the Earth Kingdom as ordered by
you, the... Avatar.

419
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:26,393
Right. The Avatar... thanks you
for your loyal service.

420
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:28,812
Did you find any more leads?

421
00:23:29,344 --> 00:23:32,760
There are reports of airbenders popping
up all over the Earth Kingdom.

422
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:36,126
I marked the villages on this map.
You guys can take it with you.

423
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,007
Actually, I was kind of hoping you could
come too.

424
00:23:41,645 --> 00:23:45,712
Really? Um... it's probably better
if I sit this one out.

425
00:23:46,194 --> 00:23:48,579
I know things have been weird
between us since we broke up,

426
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:52,358
but you're a part of Team Avatar
and we can't do this without you.

427
00:23:52,784 --> 00:23:54,567
I'm sorry. I... can't.

428
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:59,268
I'll miss you, sweetie.

429
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:01,683
I'll miss you too.

430
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,050
Once we find the airbenders,
I'll send word.

431
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,378
You can join us at the Northern
Air Temple then.

432
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,637
Hey, how come Jinora gets to go with you,
but we don't?

433
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:11,246
That's so not fair!

434
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:13,592
Yeah, what this girl said, not fair!

435
00:24:15,175 --> 00:24:17,227
Because if airbenders show up here,

436
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:19,223
they're gonna need some guidance
from you two.

437
00:24:19,245 --> 00:24:20,941
It's a very important job.

438
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,471
Really? Me, a teacher? Yay!

439
00:24:26,096 --> 00:24:28,230
Those maggots will bow to me!

440
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,652
Go easy on them, son.

441
00:24:31,585 --> 00:24:32,936
Mako, wait a sec.

442
00:24:32,962 --> 00:24:34,595
Korra already asked, bro.

443
00:24:35,177 --> 00:24:37,104
I can't just leave Republic City.

444
00:24:37,592 --> 00:24:39,481
I have a life here and a job.

445
00:24:39,803 --> 00:24:42,243
A life? You sleep under your desk.

446
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:45,334
And what's a more important job than
helping the Avatar

447
00:24:45,352 --> 00:24:47,398
rebuild an entire civilization?

448
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,278
It's not just that.

449
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:52,237
I feel like I've been drifting apart
from everyone.

450
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:55,450
Well drift back. We need you.

451
00:24:55,681 --> 00:24:59,104
Come on, Mako. We're going to Ba Sing Se,
where Dad grew up.

452
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:02,866
What if I meet our grandma for the very first time?

453
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:06,619
And she asks me, "Where is your
sweet brother,"

454
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,996
and I have to say "I'm sorry, Grandma,

455
00:25:09,013 --> 00:25:12,161
he had some really important
police paperwork to file"

456
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:15,057
and she starts to cry those grandma tears
and is like,

457
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:20,319
"Mako, oh why, Mako, I can't go on,
I can't..."

458
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:21,485
And then she dies.

459
00:25:21,506 --> 00:25:24,084
Okay, alright. I'll come with you.

460
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:29,477
I guess I got to call Bei Fong.
She's not going to be happy.

461
00:25:30,682 --> 00:25:32,691
Bye. We'll miss you.

462
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:53,579
As of now, these are the towns where
we've gotten reports about airbenders.

463
00:25:53,867 --> 00:25:57,245
It looks like we can hit up most of them
before we get to Ba Sing Se.

464
00:25:57,785 --> 00:25:59,536
We're going to bring the Air Nation back

465
00:25:59,561 --> 00:26:03,090
from the brink of extinction after
nearly 200 years.

466
00:26:03,447 --> 00:26:05,918
And it's all because of you, Korra.

467
00:26:25,565 --> 00:26:27,660
Finally, our shift change is here.

468
00:26:34,716 --> 00:26:36,849
Hey! Where are the other guards?

469
00:26:38,476 --> 00:26:39,233
Zaheer!

470
00:27:25,073 --> 00:27:26,981
It's nice to see again, Gazan.

471
00:27:27,526 --> 00:27:28,996
Thanks for busting me out.

472
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:31,311
Where'd you pick up the new skills?

473
00:27:31,495 --> 00:27:33,867
I have harmonic convergence to thank for that.

474
00:27:34,193 --> 00:27:35,232
I was given a gift.

475
00:27:35,601 --> 00:27:38,448
I believe it's a sign that our path
is a righteous one.

476
00:27:42,717 --> 00:27:47,553
Avatar Korra! Oh, it is such an honor to
have you come to our humble village.

477
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:48,648
Thanks.

478
00:27:48,713 --> 00:27:52,123
I hate to get down to business, but,
is the Airbender here now?

479
00:27:52,611 --> 00:27:56,027
Kuon and his family will be joining us
shortly for a special dinner.

480
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:57,547
Please, right this way.

481
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,238
Kuon has been the talk of the town
ever since he got airbending.

482
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:05,015
He's like a local celebrity.

483
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:09,083
I just want to say that it's an honor
to meet a fellow Airbender.

484
00:28:09,608 --> 00:28:12,812
Oh, I still just think of myself as
a simple farmer...

485
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:14,338
who can airbend.

486
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:18,905
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I still don't have any control.

487
00:28:19,234 --> 00:28:20,860
No worries. I love pie.

488
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,544
And so does Pabu.

489
00:28:24,307 --> 00:28:26,722
Well, you're so much more than
just a farmer now.

490
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,394
Harmonic convergence changed everything.

491
00:28:29,673 --> 00:28:33,302
You represent the future of a culture
that is being reborn.

492
00:28:33,596 --> 00:28:36,173
You're going to help us rebuild
the Air Nation.

493
00:28:36,293 --> 00:28:38,040
I'm going to do what now?

494
00:28:38,778 --> 00:28:41,468
The only thing I'm planning to
rebuild is my barn.

495
00:28:41,781 --> 00:28:44,090
But you must come with us to
the Northern Air Temple.

496
00:28:44,504 --> 00:28:47,707
Well, I can't do that.
I have a family and a farm.

497
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,311
Of course you can come.
This is of the utmost importance.

498
00:28:51,527 --> 00:28:52,803
Your wife will understand.

499
00:28:52,923 --> 00:28:55,763
Wait, what? No. I do not understand.

500
00:28:56,163 --> 00:28:57,934
Daddy, where are you going?

501
00:28:57,966 --> 00:29:00,031
Why does the bald man
want to take you away?

502
00:29:00,344 --> 00:29:02,271
No one's going to take
Daddy away, sweetheart.

503
00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:05,251
Actually, this bald man does
want to take him,

504
00:29:05,263 --> 00:29:07,040
but it's for an important cause.

505
00:29:07,405 --> 00:29:10,420
Your dad is an airbender and
he should learn about his culture.

506
00:29:10,904 --> 00:29:13,069
I think there's been some sort of
misunderstanding.

507
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,508
I'm not going with you.

508
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:17,117
I might be able to airbend,
but I'm no air-nomad.

509
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,075
I'm no monk.

510
00:29:18,569 --> 00:29:21,110
Okay, maybe we should just have
some dessert, huh?

511
00:29:21,122 --> 00:29:22,505
Who's up for dessert?

512
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:26,090
Sir, you must understand.
You're an airbender now,

513
00:29:26,112 --> 00:29:28,802
and there are thousands of years
of culture you must learn about.

514
00:29:28,922 --> 00:29:30,680
Skills you must master.

515
00:29:30,717 --> 00:29:33,364
You expect me to abandon my entire life?

516
00:29:33,484 --> 00:29:37,575
My family? No! No, sir!
I'm not going anywhere with you

517
00:29:37,595 --> 00:29:39,647
and I think it's best that you leave.

518
00:29:44,694 --> 00:29:48,229
In my head I saw that
playing out very differently.

519
00:29:48,231 --> 00:29:50,265
Maybe we should have stayed and tried harder

520
00:29:50,267 --> 00:29:51,700
to convince him to join us.

521
00:29:51,702 --> 00:29:53,435
Or we could've thrown him into a potato sack

522
00:29:53,437 --> 00:29:54,869
and forced him into the ship.

523
00:29:54,871 --> 00:29:57,839
That's how they got me to
join the united forces.

524
00:29:57,841 --> 00:29:59,641
No, we can't coerce people

525
00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:01,710
or throw them in potato sacks.

526
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:03,178
They must come freely.

527
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,346
But not to worry,

528
00:30:04,348 --> 00:30:06,114
there are plenty of other
airbenders out there

529
00:30:06,116 --> 00:30:07,449
who will be happy to come with us

530
00:30:07,451 --> 00:30:09,918
once they find out what
the air nation's all about.

531
00:30:12,488 --> 00:30:14,189
When your son becomes a master,

532
00:30:14,191 --> 00:30:19,127
he'll get tattoos all over his body,
just like me.

533
00:30:20,963 --> 00:30:25,567
There's nothing more nutritious
than our vegetarian diet.

534
00:30:27,236 --> 00:30:29,404
I can tell that you're going to love

535
00:30:29,406 --> 00:30:31,873
wearing our ancient airbender robes.

536
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:34,676
They're very breathable.

537
00:30:36,512 --> 00:30:37,779
You'll never have to worry

538
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:39,648
about your worldly possessions again

539
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,683
because you won't have any.

540
00:30:41,685 --> 00:30:44,019
You'll get to shave your head!

541
00:30:44,021 --> 00:30:46,588
Your best friend will be a giant bison!

542
00:30:52,996 --> 00:30:54,896
I really thought I had that last guy.

543
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:57,632
Who doesn't want a bison
as their best friend?

544
00:30:57,634 --> 00:30:59,034
It's okay, Tenzin.

545
00:30:59,036 --> 00:31:00,969
I still want to be an airbender.

546
00:31:00,971 --> 00:31:03,138
Okay, we've tried it your way,

547
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,073
and people just don't seem to be responding.

548
00:31:05,075 --> 00:31:07,442
It's time for a little tough love.

549
00:31:10,113 --> 00:31:12,914
Oh, are you the Avatar?

550
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:15,116
When my son got airbending,

551
00:31:15,118 --> 00:31:17,085
my husband and I were so happy.

552
00:31:17,087 --> 00:31:20,055
We thought this could open
a lot of doors for him.

553
00:31:20,057 --> 00:31:22,590
And maybe he could finally
move out of the basement.

554
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:26,094
How old is he?

555
00:31:26,096 --> 00:31:28,329
He's 22, and, you know,

556
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:30,532
still just figuring his life out.

557
00:31:30,534 --> 00:31:33,535
Well, I have a great opportunity for him.

558
00:31:33,537 --> 00:31:35,704
We're looking for airbenders to join us

559
00:31:35,706 --> 00:31:37,138
at the Northern Air Temple.

560
00:31:38,675 --> 00:31:41,443
That sounds wonderful! I'll get him.

561
00:31:41,445 --> 00:31:44,212
Ryu, get up here!

562
00:31:51,153 --> 00:31:53,455
Hi, I'm Korra.

563
00:31:53,457 --> 00:31:57,058
So, you're like the Avatar or something?
Big deal.

564
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:00,161
Ah, I just wanted to talk to you

565
00:32:00,163 --> 00:32:01,563
about an opportunity...

566
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:03,865
yeah, I heard you talking to my mom,

567
00:32:03,867 --> 00:32:05,066
and I'm not interested.

568
00:32:05,068 --> 00:32:07,535
Well, you're gonna be interested!

569
00:32:12,408 --> 00:32:14,676
You're an airbender now,
and you have a responsibility

570
00:32:14,678 --> 00:32:16,344
as a citizen of the world.

571
00:32:16,346 --> 00:32:17,712
Whatever.

572
00:32:17,714 --> 00:32:20,081
I didn't ask to become an airbender,
you know.

573
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:23,051
Well, I didn't ask to be the Avatar,

574
00:32:23,053 --> 00:32:25,820
but I am, and I'm fulfilling my duties.

575
00:32:25,822 --> 00:32:27,856
So? You don't have to.

576
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:29,758
Yes, I do have to.

577
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,959
No, you don't.

578
00:32:30,961 --> 00:32:32,026
Yes, I do.

579
00:32:32,028 --> 00:32:34,496
No, you don't.

580
00:32:34,498 --> 00:32:37,098
Well, if I didn't embrace my role,

581
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,534
then our entire world
could be thrown into chaos.

582
00:32:39,536 --> 00:32:41,703
Think about that. Is that what you want?

583
00:32:41,705 --> 00:32:44,139
- Maybe.
- No, it's not!

584
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:45,540
So what? Who cares?

585
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:47,375
Everyone cares!

586
00:32:47,377 --> 00:32:48,443
I don't care.

587
00:32:48,445 --> 00:32:50,111
Yes, you do!

588
00:32:50,113 --> 00:32:51,479
No, I don't.

589
00:32:51,481 --> 00:32:52,981
Well, you're about to care,
you little slacker,

590
00:32:52,983 --> 00:32:56,017
because you're coming with me!

591
00:32:56,019 --> 00:32:58,920
Stop pulling on my collar,
you're stretching it out.

592
00:32:58,922 --> 00:33:01,322
Mom,
are you just gonna just let her take me?

593
00:33:01,324 --> 00:33:03,892
I think it's a great opportunity.

594
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:07,095
Just try it for a
week and see how it goes.

595
00:33:07,097 --> 00:33:09,030
No! Let me go!

596
00:33:09,032 --> 00:33:10,198
Aah!

597
00:33:11,902 --> 00:33:14,068
That's it!

598
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,070
Korra, enough!

599
00:33:15,071 --> 00:33:16,704
Let's get out of here.

600
00:33:16,706 --> 00:33:20,074
So nice to meet you.
Good luck with your son.

601
00:33:39,495 --> 00:33:41,329
We're under attack!

602
00:33:41,331 --> 00:33:42,897
Look out!

603
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:48,203
Aah!

604
00:33:49,772 --> 00:33:51,973
Aah!

605
00:34:10,693 --> 00:34:11,826
Oh!

606
00:34:18,634 --> 00:34:19,934
Whoa!

607
00:34:29,044 --> 00:34:31,346
I never thought I'd be so happy

608
00:34:31,348 --> 00:34:33,314
to see your ugly mugs again.

609
00:34:33,316 --> 00:34:35,917
Great to see you too, Ming-Hua.

610
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:38,386
I'm flattered, you busted me out

611
00:34:38,388 --> 00:34:40,121
before that girlfriend of yours.

612
00:34:40,123 --> 00:34:42,457
We're getting her next.

613
00:34:42,459 --> 00:34:45,460
Well,
I guess we should just go to Ba Sing Se

614
00:34:45,462 --> 00:34:47,028
and try our luck there.

615
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,162
I don't know what to do.

616
00:34:48,164 --> 00:34:50,064
I just thought more people would be excited

617
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:51,332
about coming with us.

618
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:54,168
Well,
maybe you gotta do more to get them excited.

619
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,771
You need to add a little razzle dazzle.

620
00:34:56,773 --> 00:34:58,706
Yeah, razzle dazzle.

621
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:01,910
We could put on some sort of
airbending street performance.

622
00:35:01,912 --> 00:35:05,113
I was going to say we could
cover Tenzin's robe in sequins,

623
00:35:05,115 --> 00:35:07,515
but that's even better.

624
00:35:07,517 --> 00:35:11,352
It sounds ridiculous, but it might work.

625
00:35:11,354 --> 00:35:13,755
I'm willing to try anything at this point.

626
00:35:13,757 --> 00:35:17,592
Yes! That is the kind of
enthusiasm I like to hear.

627
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:24,799
Come one,
come all and witness the amazing airbenders!

628
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:29,737
An airbending show that will
leave you breathless with wind!

629
00:35:29,739 --> 00:35:32,807
First up, the tattooed master himself.

630
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:35,710
You know him as the son of Avatar Aang.

631
00:35:35,712 --> 00:35:37,278
He shaves every hair on his head,

632
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,047
every single day.

633
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:41,249
It's the one, the only guy

634
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:43,651
with an arrow pointing to his nose...

635
00:35:43,653 --> 00:35:46,988
Tenzin!

636
00:35:54,797 --> 00:35:56,164
Now, now, ladies and gentlemen,

637
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:57,699
ladies and gentlemen, please be quiet.

638
00:35:57,701 --> 00:35:59,100
I have some serious news.

639
00:35:59,102 --> 00:36:02,136
We've heard that an
escaped firebending convict

640
00:36:02,138 --> 00:36:03,671
has been spotted near here.

641
00:36:03,673 --> 00:36:05,306
Now, I don't want to panic anyone,

642
00:36:05,308 --> 00:36:09,644
but if you see a firebender
with a red scarf...

643
00:36:09,646 --> 00:36:12,313
I see him. He's right there!

644
00:36:12,315 --> 00:36:14,215
I am the escaped convict,

645
00:36:14,217 --> 00:36:17,852
and you will all reap my fire.

646
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,557
Oh, no, who will help us?

647
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:23,858
I will!

648
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:27,495
With my airbending skills.

649
00:36:28,697 --> 00:36:29,864
Whoa! Aah!

650
00:36:29,866 --> 00:36:32,433
Oh! Aah! Aah!

651
00:36:32,435 --> 00:36:34,402
Hey! Let me go!

652
00:36:34,404 --> 00:36:36,537
This is not what we rehearsed!

653
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:37,672
Korra!

654
00:36:39,843 --> 00:36:42,510
With the power of airbending,

655
00:36:42,512 --> 00:36:46,848
even this beast can float like a feather!

656
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:51,886
Look what can be done in only
a few short weeks of practice.

657
00:36:51,888 --> 00:36:53,121
No, no, don't worry, folks,

658
00:36:53,123 --> 00:36:54,288
she might be young,

659
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,924
but she is in full control.

660
00:36:58,561 --> 00:36:59,827
Ladies and gentlemen,

661
00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:02,363
if you or anyone you know is an airbender,

662
00:37:02,365 --> 00:37:04,465
please send them our way.

663
00:37:04,467 --> 00:37:06,634
Master Tenzin and Avatar
Korra would love to teach them

664
00:37:06,636 --> 00:37:08,669
all they know.

665
00:37:13,142 --> 00:37:15,576
Hey. Hello.

666
00:37:15,578 --> 00:37:17,045
If you're looking for airbenders,

667
00:37:17,047 --> 00:37:21,315
you just found one.

668
00:37:21,317 --> 00:37:23,317
I want to join you guys.

669
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:25,486
Get outta town!

670
00:37:25,488 --> 00:37:28,189
We got our first recruit.

671
00:37:30,185 --> 00:37:31,852
Just to be totally clear,

672
00:37:31,854 --> 00:37:33,721
we're going to be heading to Ba Sing Se,

673
00:37:33,723 --> 00:37:36,123
then the Northern air
temple to live as nomads

674
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:37,992
and rebuild the air nation.

675
00:37:37,994 --> 00:37:39,727
All that sound good to you?

676
00:37:39,729 --> 00:37:41,896
Yeah, Ba Sing Se, rebuild the temple,

677
00:37:41,898 --> 00:37:43,731
air nomad what do you do... I'm in.

678
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:45,132
Let's go right now.

679
00:37:45,134 --> 00:37:47,101
This is going to be so great.

680
00:37:47,103 --> 00:37:49,537
You are gonna love it... uh, ah...

681
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:50,538
real quick, what's your name?

682
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,541
Kai. So when do we hit the road?

683
00:37:53,543 --> 00:37:56,243
Hang on a second, Kai.
Where are your parents?

684
00:37:56,245 --> 00:37:58,546
We can't have you come with
us without their permission.

685
00:37:58,548 --> 00:38:01,782
My parents are... Gone.

686
00:38:01,784 --> 00:38:04,151
You're an orphan?

687
00:38:04,153 --> 00:38:06,754
It happened about a year ago.

688
00:38:06,756 --> 00:38:09,457
My hometown was raided by outlaws,

689
00:38:09,459 --> 00:38:11,559
but my parents fought back against them.

690
00:38:11,561 --> 00:38:14,929
I was so scared,
but they told me not to worry.

691
00:38:14,931 --> 00:38:16,564
They would protect me.

692
00:38:16,566 --> 00:38:18,499
And they did.

693
00:38:18,501 --> 00:38:21,168
My parents saved me and the entire village.

694
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,304
But they died in the fight.

695
00:38:23,306 --> 00:38:25,306
Mom and pop meant everything to me.

696
00:38:25,308 --> 00:38:27,274
They were my whole life.

697
00:38:28,644 --> 00:38:30,811
Ever since then, I've been on my own

698
00:38:30,813 --> 00:38:31,946
and on the run.

699
00:38:31,948 --> 00:38:34,281
Those same outlaws are still after me.

700
00:38:34,283 --> 00:38:36,817
Well,
you don't have to be on the run anymore.

701
00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:38,919
Right, guys? Tell him.

702
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:41,756
I'm so sorry ry about your parents.

703
00:38:41,758 --> 00:38:44,458
I know we could never replace them,

704
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,893
but we're here for you.

705
00:38:45,895 --> 00:38:49,330
We'll keep you safe. Come on.

706
00:38:49,332 --> 00:38:50,731
When you board this airship,

707
00:38:50,733 --> 00:38:52,266
you're gonna leave your old life behind

708
00:38:52,268 --> 00:38:53,367
and start a new path.

709
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:55,169
That's some big brother advice.

710
00:38:55,171 --> 00:38:57,238
Just think of me as your big brother.

711
00:39:06,348 --> 00:39:08,516
Guys, I think we got trouble.

712
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,959
Release the boy or we'll take him by force.

713
00:39:22,064 --> 00:39:24,265
The outlaws... they're after me.

714
00:39:24,267 --> 00:39:25,332
Let's get out of here!

715
00:39:25,334 --> 00:39:28,269
We're not running from anyone.

716
00:39:29,805 --> 00:39:32,773
If you want Kai,
you'll have to go through me!

717
00:39:51,593 --> 00:39:53,961
Your days of harassing
an innocent boy are over.

718
00:39:53,963 --> 00:39:55,729
You outlaws are going to prison.

719
00:39:55,731 --> 00:39:56,831
Outlaws?

720
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:58,332
Innocent boy?

721
00:39:58,334 --> 00:40:00,935
I'm a sheriff and these are my deputies.

722
00:40:00,937 --> 00:40:02,436
And this kid is a thief.

723
00:40:02,438 --> 00:40:04,305
Whatever he told you is a lie.

724
00:40:04,307 --> 00:40:06,273
We've been chasing him for months.

725
00:40:06,275 --> 00:40:10,010
Where's Kai?

726
00:40:10,012 --> 00:40:11,712
Right here.

727
00:40:11,714 --> 00:40:13,514
I found him slipping away.

728
00:40:13,516 --> 00:40:15,516
I was going to the bathroom.

729
00:40:15,518 --> 00:40:19,553
With your sack of gold?

730
00:40:19,555 --> 00:40:21,622
I told you, I found that on the road!

731
00:40:21,624 --> 00:40:24,725
Enough with the lies, kid. I want the truth.

732
00:40:24,727 --> 00:40:27,228
The truth is, he's the outlaw.

733
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,463
He spent his entire life as an orphan

734
00:40:29,465 --> 00:40:31,632
until he got adopted by a real nice family

735
00:40:31,634 --> 00:40:33,067
about six months ago.

736
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:34,468
And how did he repay them?

737
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,937
By taking their entire life savings.

738
00:40:36,939 --> 00:40:38,339
We've been after him ever since.

739
00:40:38,341 --> 00:40:39,640
Is that true?

740
00:40:39,642 --> 00:40:42,109
The person who stole that
stuff was the old me.

741
00:40:42,111 --> 00:40:45,012
Once I got airbending, I changed.

742
00:40:45,014 --> 00:40:46,881
I don't know how to explain it,

743
00:40:46,883 --> 00:40:49,750
but I feel like airbending
chose me for a reason.

744
00:40:49,752 --> 00:40:51,719
Like I'm a new person.

745
00:40:51,721 --> 00:40:53,354
I'm sorry! Please!

746
00:40:53,356 --> 00:40:56,090
You have to listen to me.

747
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,095
Are you taking him back to the orphanage?

748
00:41:01,097 --> 00:41:03,364
No. He's headed to jail.

749
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,667
Wait!

750
00:41:06,669 --> 00:41:09,503
You guys got the family's life savings back.

751
00:41:09,505 --> 00:41:11,105
Now let us take Kai.

752
00:41:11,107 --> 00:41:13,140
Do you really want our first new member

753
00:41:13,142 --> 00:41:16,076
of the air nation to be a liar and a thief?

754
00:41:16,078 --> 00:41:18,579
He just needs some guidance, Tenzin.

755
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:20,648
And who better to give it to him than us?

756
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:24,051
Do you want this kid or not?

757
00:41:24,053 --> 00:41:27,221
Yes. You can release the
boy into our custody.

758
00:41:30,825 --> 00:41:32,293
Thank you.

759
00:41:32,295 --> 00:41:34,228
Don't make me regret it.

760
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,698
Welcome to the family, little bro.

761
00:41:44,172 --> 00:41:46,006
I just want you to know,

762
00:41:46,008 --> 00:41:47,374
I'm going to be watching you, kid.

763
00:41:47,376 --> 00:41:49,710
I know exactly what you're all about

764
00:41:49,712 --> 00:41:51,478
because I've been there before.

765
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,980
You don't have me fooled.

766
00:41:52,982 --> 00:41:55,549
Whoa, hey, lighten up.

767
00:41:55,551 --> 00:41:57,384
I'm turning over a new leaf.

768
00:41:57,386 --> 00:41:59,086
Making a change.

769
00:41:59,088 --> 00:42:01,622
Don't you worry about me.

770
00:42:01,624 --> 00:42:03,691
Hi, I'm Jinora.

771
00:42:03,693 --> 00:42:05,426
If you need any help with airbending

772
00:42:05,428 --> 00:42:06,827
I could show you what I know.

773
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:09,396
Thanks. That's real nice of you.

774
00:42:09,398 --> 00:42:12,533
Jinora! We're leaving now.

775
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:31,652
They came out of nowhere.
I'm so sorry, Lord Zuko.

776
00:42:31,654 --> 00:42:33,954
How could you let this happen?

777
00:42:33,956 --> 00:42:36,090
They caught us by surprise.

778
00:42:36,092 --> 00:42:38,392
And Zaheer is an airbender now.

779
00:42:38,394 --> 00:42:40,928
No! This can't be.

780
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:44,832
Do you have any idea the
power these criminals possess?

781
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:47,434
Individually, they can take down any bender.

782
00:42:47,436 --> 00:42:48,869
Put them all together,

783
00:42:48,871 --> 00:42:51,438
they could take down the entire world.

784
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,842
And now you're telling me
their leader is an airbender?

785
00:42:54,844 --> 00:42:55,876
We can track them...

786
00:42:55,878 --> 00:42:57,244
We don't need to track them.

787
00:42:57,246 --> 00:42:59,046
I know exactly where they're going.

788
00:42:59,048 --> 00:43:01,649
Notify the new chiefs of
the Northern watertribe

789
00:43:01,651 --> 00:43:04,485
that an attack on their prison is imminent.

790
00:43:04,487 --> 00:43:07,688
And send word to Lin
Beifong in Republic City.

791
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:11,925
The Avatar must be protected.

792
00:43:11,927 --> 00:43:13,694
Where are you going?

793
00:43:13,696 --> 00:43:16,563
To stop them.

794
00:43:21,671 --> 00:43:26,814
