2
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:27,126
I fear I may not survive
this war reenactment.

3
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,329
I can't believe we're only
12 feet from the parking lot.

4
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:33,766
This is every bit as fun
as the real Civil War.

5
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,300
Not the Civil War, private.

6
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,703
We're reenacting the Sith-al War.

7
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:38,937
Sith?

8
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,072
What the hoth?

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,975
Enemy invaders up in yonder sky!

10
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:59,958
I am Darth Stroyer.

11
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:01,493
Darth Stroyer?

12
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,462
That's the stupidest
name I've ever heard.

13
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,897
Let's hear the rest.

14
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,132
Darth Trocious.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,134
Darth Sploder.

16
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,437
Darth Urderer.

17
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:14,907
Darth It-head.

18
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,544
Company, attack!

19
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:26,452
Don't fire till you see
the greens of their eyes.

20
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,953
It saves on bullets.

21
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:46,839
I shall rip out your heart
and show it to you.

22
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,141
It is done.

23
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:54,246
The candle that burns twice
as bright burns half as long.

24
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,681
Mm-hmm.

25
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,851
Whoa!

26
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,085
You're dead.

27
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,521
No, I'm just very old.

28
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,527
Whoa, that's good acting.

29
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,762
It's payback time, Sploder.

30
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,769
Tell my mother...

31
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:22,474
To pick me up outside Quizno's.

32
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:23,976
That's three dead.

33
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,177
Whoa-ooh.

34
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,879
Let's pick up the pace, people.

35
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:30,582
At this point in the actual War,
the death toll was 98 million.

36
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,419
You humans
and your fragile organs.

37
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,921
One little stab to the goo, and...

38
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,425
You're dead, Earth man.

39
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,060
Oh, cruel fate,

40
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:43,462
I'm dead.

41
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,197
They're putting me in my Sunday suit

42
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:48,033
and shoving me in a wooden box.

43
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:52,638
Now they're lowering me
into the cold, cold ground.

44
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,373
Hello, here come the worms.

45
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,478
If you were really dead, you
wouldn't be laughing so hard.

46
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,382
Yeah, yeah, death's a big deal
to you flesh bags,

47
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:06,518
but in case you didn't notice,
I'm a robot.

48
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,421
So? What if something heavy fell
on you, like a church?

49
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,923
You could still die.

50
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,291
Nuh-uh.

51
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,160
My wireless backup unit saves
a copy of me every day,

52
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,829
so if my body gets killed,
big whoop,

53
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,165
I just download into another body.

54
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,533
I'm immortal, baby.

55
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,502
What?! Then how come
you always scream

56
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,470
so much when you're in danger?

57
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,173
I never said I wasn't a drama queen.

58
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,643
And the winner of the war is...

59
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,580
Ah, let me just cross-check
my tabulation here.

60
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,648
Factor in the corsages
for the widows...

61
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,518
Hurry up,
you number-crunching crumbnuncher.

62
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,221
Everybody but me is
dying of old age.

63
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,056
Okay... ah.

64
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,591
The winners, at a net cost

65
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,927
of only $12 per life cut tragically short,

66
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,296
our Sith Overlords.

67
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:53,799
Hot diggity.

68
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,033
Oh, I mean...

69
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,804
Supreme diggity.

70
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,873
Good war, good war, good war...

71
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:13,785
It may have been a fake war, but
my scuffed knee is all too real.

72
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:17,289
I've got pains in joints
I had removed a century ago.

73
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:21,260
Bender, bring me my soft chair
with the wheels on it.

74
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,095
- Your wheelchair?
- I don't need a wheelchair!

75
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,797
The one with the wheels.

76
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,666
Poor flimsy humans.

77
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,935
Don't you wish
you were flawless like me?

78
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,038
A towering inferno
of physical perfection?

79
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,875
I hate to pop your blimp-like
ego, but you are not perfect.

80
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,577
- Am so.
- Are not.

81
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,212
- Is too.
- Says who?

82
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,580
Says the only human

83
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:45,117
whose opinion
I even remotely respect.

84
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,687
Inspector Five, the best inspector

85
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,889
a kid could want.

86
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,392
The day I was built,
he looked me over,

87
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,327
probably with tears
of pride in his eyes,

88
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:59,631
and proclaimed to all the world,
by means of this scrap of paper,

89
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,102
that I was perfect
and infallible in every way.

90
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,937
Hey, Mr. Perfect,

91
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,739
you wet the chair.

92
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,374
Huh? Wasn't me.

93
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,411
Must be some of that urine
you're all so proud of.

94
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,881
That's not urine. It's oil.

95
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,449
Impossible.

96
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,151
I'm triple-sealed
to prevent any chance of...

97
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,722
You call that an ink defense?

98
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,527
Good-bye, friends.

99
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,030
What could have caused the leak?

100
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,433
Excessive heat,
on account of I'm so hot?

101
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,268
Alas, no.

102
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,839
Oh, Bender, I'm afraid it's
a symptom of a fatal defect.

103
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,174
Eh, fatal, shmatal.

104
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,743
If I die, I can just
download my backup copy

105
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,879
into a new, equally fabulous body.

106
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,815
That's just it. You can't.

107
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,951
You were built without a backup unit.

108
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,121
There's no backup copy of me?

109
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,857
That's what I just said,
you mortal coil.

110
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,692
So, if I die...

111
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,494
You die, or as you put it...

112
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,865
Um, excuse me for a moment.

113
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,172
No...!

114
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:21,373
I can't believe it!
I'm gonna die!

115
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,909
How much time
does he have left, Professor?

116
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:26,478
Between a minute
and a billion years.

117
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:28,613
Well, at least
you can plan accordingly.

118
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:30,181
Dying sucks butt!

119
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:32,717
How do you living beings
cope with mortality?

120
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:35,654
- Violent outbursts.
- General sluttiness.

121
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:37,756
Thanks to denial, I'm immortal.

122
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,858
Damn it, I'm supposed
to be perfect!

123
00:06:39,926 --> 00:06:42,460
Inspector Five gave me
his blessing!

124
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:45,096
How could he bring me into
this world, knowing I would die?

125
00:06:45,164 --> 00:06:47,599
So you wish
you were never born, maybe?

126
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:49,801
Yes, anything less than immortality

127
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:51,836
is a complete waste of time.

128
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:53,204
Then suicide it is.

129
00:06:53,272 --> 00:06:54,673
Step into my office.

130
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,942
I'll give you a nice kevorking.

131
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:59,110
Not until I hunt down
Inspector Five

132
00:06:59,178 --> 00:07:01,146
and beat an explanation out of him.

133
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,949
I'm all for a good beating,
but you'll never find him.

134
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:05,617
Product inspectors are bureaucrats,

135
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:08,920
faceless bean-counters
who blend into the woodwork.

136
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:10,655
I beg to differ.

137
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:12,924
Stinkin' bureaucrats... I hate 'em!

138
00:07:12,992 --> 00:07:14,159
Then again,

139
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,227
you might be able
to find Inspector Five

140
00:07:16,295 --> 00:07:18,563
with the help of another
seasoned bureaucrat.

141
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:20,231
Hermes, old pal.

142
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:21,366
Old pal?

143
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:24,002
8.5 seconds ago,
you said you hated me.

144
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,870
Time heals all wounds.

145
00:07:25,938 --> 00:07:28,239
You know what? I will help you,

146
00:07:28,307 --> 00:07:31,643
but only to prove I'm not just
a paper-pushing file jockey.

147
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:33,945
Will you be taking
your portable filing cabinet?

148
00:07:34,013 --> 00:07:35,513
None of your beeswax.

149
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,084
I'll only be away an hour,

150
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:40,285
but I'm counting on you to do

151
00:07:40,353 --> 00:07:42,420
the all-critical filing in my absence.

152
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:44,956
Shall we review alphabetical order?

153
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:48,360
- ♪ A-b-c-d... ♪
- Get out of my office.

154
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:54,733
Yes, I'd like to request
a death certificate.

155
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,837
Sorry, that's Building C.

156
00:07:58,904 --> 00:08:00,338
The Central Bureaucracy

157
00:08:00,406 --> 00:08:02,240
maintains records
on all bureaucrats.

158
00:08:02,308 --> 00:08:04,542
We should be able to
look up Inspector Five.

159
00:08:08,914 --> 00:08:11,149
Application for ingress approved.

160
00:08:11,217 --> 00:08:13,051
And the other potential entrant?

161
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:15,153
Uh... he's my pencil sharpener.

162
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:16,554
You betcha!

163
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,860
Proceed.

164
00:08:34,774 --> 00:08:39,077
I maintain a cubicle here
for weekend getaways.

165
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:44,215
Wow.

166
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:47,052
Until now, I thought
giant cubes were exciting.

167
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:05,003
I did like the part
where they screamed.

168
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:08,440
This is mine,

169
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:11,409
right next to the Center Square.

170
00:09:11,477 --> 00:09:14,979
Sorry, Hermes, I drank
all your white-out.

171
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:19,250
Once I log in, I can access
Inspector Five's profile.

172
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:24,789
Damn it, it won't go on!

173
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,658
That's because you're not me.

174
00:09:26,725 --> 00:09:28,626
Hooray, it won't go on!

175
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,228
The bureaucra-scan
won't let anyone

176
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:32,030
but the assigned
bureaucrat log in.

177
00:09:33,632 --> 00:09:35,667
Identity confirmed.

178
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:39,037
Also, you have a rectangular
mass in your colon.

179
00:09:39,105 --> 00:09:42,107
That's a calculator.
I ate it to gain its power.

180
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:46,845
You locate Inspector five while
I slip into my ass-kicking feet.

181
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,648
Sweet file-not-found-of-puegot sound.

182
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,317
His record's been blanked.

183
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:53,885
Aw, man.

184
00:09:53,953 --> 00:09:55,553
How am I gonna find
some anonymous guy

185
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:57,188
I don't know anything about?

186
00:09:57,256 --> 00:10:01,226
I recommend the men's room
at the Twa Terminal.

187
00:10:11,103 --> 00:10:14,038
Okay, just file it alphabetically...

188
00:10:14,106 --> 00:10:15,773
♪ A-b-c-d... ♪

189
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:19,277
Well, this requires a little extra thought.

190
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,682
I'm a natural.

191
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,086
The information we need will be
here, in the physical files.

192
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:31,623
Those bastards won't know
what leafed through them.

193
00:10:42,535 --> 00:10:43,635
It's on.

194
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:49,774
No! This is impossible!

195
00:10:49,842 --> 00:10:51,643
Quit blacking out and look at this.

196
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,547
Inspector One, Two, Three, Four, Six!

197
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:58,516
There's no trace of Inspector Five!

198
00:10:58,584 --> 00:10:59,918
But Five's the one we want!

199
00:10:59,985 --> 00:11:03,054
Maybe if I kicked
the asses of Inspector Two,

200
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:04,622
plus Inspector Three...

201
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,025
Addition never solved anything, mon.

202
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:09,394
Let's cut our losses and go home.

203
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:14,032
So I'm doomed to die,

204
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:17,235
and I'll never even get
to punch whoever's responsible?!

205
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:19,370
Oh, what's the point?!

206
00:11:19,438 --> 00:11:20,772
Bender, no!

207
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:23,074
Suicide isn't necessarily the answer.

208
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:25,476
It's not a suicide booth, you lard ass.

209
00:11:25,544 --> 00:11:27,478
It's a phone booth.

210
00:11:27,546 --> 00:11:29,280
They have phones in booths now?

211
00:11:29,348 --> 00:11:33,184
Finally, I don't have
to lug this cell phone around.

212
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:39,824
Who the hell is this?

213
00:11:39,892 --> 00:11:41,659
How did you get this number?

214
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:43,194
Is this the robot company?

215
00:11:43,262 --> 00:11:45,530
'Cause I have a complaint
about a defective robot.

216
00:11:45,598 --> 00:11:47,098
His name is me!

217
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,534
A defective robot, you say?

218
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:53,438
Stay right there, dearie.

219
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,873
I'll have tech support
take care of you.

220
00:11:57,142 --> 00:11:59,544
Well, things are starting to look up.

221
00:11:59,612 --> 00:12:01,079
Look up!

222
00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:08,453
Who did you call, dial-a-bomb?

223
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,856
No, I just told the robot
company I was defective.

224
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:13,691
You dumb cocktail shaker!

225
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,393
Mom won't allow a defective product

226
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:16,728
to tarnish her good name!

227
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:18,296
She'll kill you!

228
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:20,898
Big whoop.
I'll just download into a new...

229
00:12:20,966 --> 00:12:22,267
Oh, right.

230
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:23,968
If I die, I die.

231
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,937
Speaking of which...

232
00:12:26,005 --> 00:12:27,105
You're right. You're right.
You're right.

233
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:31,976
That's what you get
for calling tech support.

234
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:42,339
I can't run anymore.

235
00:12:42,406 --> 00:12:43,807
I'll have to skip.

236
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:52,749
Just a few more feet.

237
00:12:52,817 --> 00:12:56,019
We have to get to that
pile of dead bears by 7:38.

238
00:12:56,087 --> 00:12:58,655
A pile of dead bears
can only mean one thing.

239
00:12:58,723 --> 00:13:00,023
But what?

240
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,328
It's the 7:38!

241
00:13:05,396 --> 00:13:07,330
Jump!

242
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:10,333
Ah, shoot!

243
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:11,968
Someone said shoot.

244
00:13:30,721 --> 00:13:32,088
Well, we're boned.

245
00:13:32,156 --> 00:13:33,290
No, we're not!

246
00:13:33,357 --> 00:13:34,658
We just got to limbo.

247
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:36,860
But I'm not designed
to bend that low.

248
00:13:36,928 --> 00:13:38,562
Not without limbo music.

249
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:42,032
That'll do it!

250
00:13:42,099 --> 00:13:44,134
Ow! Ow! Ow, ow! Ooh.

251
00:13:46,304 --> 00:13:47,571
We're gonna get fired.

252
00:13:47,638 --> 00:13:49,339
Someone said fire.

253
00:14:00,184 --> 00:14:01,351
We did it!

254
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:02,986
12 straight hours of limbo.

255
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:04,554
I haven't done that
since my honeymoon.

256
00:14:04,622 --> 00:14:06,790
Hermes, Hermes, remember
that flock of bats?

257
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:08,425
I sure do.

258
00:14:08,492 --> 00:14:09,926
That was fun.

259
00:14:09,994 --> 00:14:11,962
Where are we?

260
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:13,396
I have no idea.

261
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:24,774
Hey, we're just a stone's throw
from Tijuana.

262
00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:26,176
See?

263
00:14:28,145 --> 00:14:29,746
Dios mio!

264
00:14:29,814 --> 00:14:34,184
A rock has fallen here
in the outskirts of Tijuana.

265
00:14:34,252 --> 00:14:36,086
Is it within the city limit?

266
00:14:36,153 --> 00:14:37,654
I think, yes.

267
00:14:37,722 --> 00:14:39,089
Told you.

268
00:14:39,156 --> 00:14:40,857
Hey, you want
to celebrate our escape?

269
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:44,160
Maybe grab a shot of Tequila and
take in a big-league cockfight?

270
00:14:44,228 --> 00:14:45,462
Sure. No, wait.

271
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:46,830
I was built in Tijuana.

272
00:14:46,898 --> 00:14:49,566
Maybe Inspector Five still works there.

273
00:14:49,634 --> 00:14:51,067
He better do some 'splainin'

274
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,537
before I mash up
some face guacamole.

275
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:58,775
He's Mexican, I'm Mexican.

276
00:14:58,843 --> 00:15:00,610
Let me handle this.

277
00:15:00,678 --> 00:15:03,013
Sus papeles, por favor

278
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,715
Sí.

279
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:07,083
Ouch-o!

280
00:15:08,352 --> 00:15:11,054
Here are our passports, visas,

281
00:15:11,122 --> 00:15:12,989
and Homeland Security
permission slips.

282
00:15:13,057 --> 00:15:14,925
Notarized and starched.

283
00:15:14,992 --> 00:15:17,460
Okay.

284
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:20,130
I also would have accepted a bribe.

285
00:15:20,197 --> 00:15:22,899
Nice work, butterball.

286
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:25,001
You know, I was in Italy last week.

287
00:15:29,707 --> 00:15:32,776
My birthplace. It's closed!

288
00:15:32,843 --> 00:15:34,577
There's not even a shrine to me

289
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:37,347
with a gift shop,
selling piñatas of me!

290
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:38,982
End of the line, mon.

291
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,318
Come on, we can still catch a
twi-night double-cockfight.

292
00:15:41,385 --> 00:15:42,552
No, wait!

293
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,454
What's that in the Mexican garbage?

294
00:15:44,522 --> 00:15:46,589
Looks like a half-eaten
cheese diaper.

295
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:48,124
No, next to that.

296
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,128
A half-eaten employee directory.

297
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:56,199
Inspector Five's home address!

298
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:58,868
His ass-ias is gracias!

299
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:11,848
Where are you hiding, you coward?!

300
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,217
Get out here
and get murdered like a man!

301
00:16:14,285 --> 00:16:17,287
Bender, I'm afraid
our search is at an end.

302
00:16:17,355 --> 00:16:19,255
He's obviously long gone.

303
00:16:19,323 --> 00:16:20,724
Oh, yeah?!

304
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,159
Well, maybe this is him
in a costume!

305
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:26,730
I'm gonna squeeze you out of
there like Tijuana toothpaste!

306
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:33,336
Whoa!

307
00:16:33,404 --> 00:16:36,039
Okay, Bender, you're mortal.

308
00:16:36,107 --> 00:16:38,675
And okay, Inspector Five screwed up.

309
00:16:38,743 --> 00:16:42,045
But that just makes the time you
have left all the more precious.

310
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:44,647
Do you really to waste
the rest of your life

311
00:16:44,715 --> 00:16:46,249
in a bitter, homicidal rage?

312
00:16:46,317 --> 00:16:47,650
No!

313
00:16:47,718 --> 00:16:49,052
Yes!

314
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:51,955
I don't know!

315
00:16:59,063 --> 00:17:03,099
Why? Why did he do this to me?!

316
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:06,136
All I wanted was a little quality control.

317
00:17:06,203 --> 00:17:09,572
But he didn't care enough,
and now I'm gonna die!

318
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,541
I deserved better!

319
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,109
I'm Bender, damn it!

320
00:17:13,177 --> 00:17:15,478
I'm Bender!

321
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:18,848
There, there, mon.

322
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,417
It's gonna be okay.

323
00:17:20,484 --> 00:17:21,885
You are Bender,

324
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:25,121
which is something
Inspector Five will never be.

325
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:27,357
You know what?

326
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:28,658
You're right.

327
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:30,427
He was just a stupid bureaucrat.

328
00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:32,762
A stupid, paper-pushing bureaucrat.

329
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,765
A stupid I-dotting, chair-squashing...

330
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,100
Oh.

331
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:38,535
No offense, Hermes.

332
00:17:38,602 --> 00:17:40,103
You're not like that.

333
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:42,539
I mean, you're exactly like that,
but you're okay.

334
00:17:42,606 --> 00:17:46,443
In fact, I'm putting you
on the do-not-kill list.

335
00:17:48,045 --> 00:17:50,513
Come on, fellow mortal.
We're in Tijuana.

336
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:51,981
I want to live a little.

337
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:53,450
Help!

338
00:17:53,517 --> 00:17:54,818
I'm gonna die!

339
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:56,019
That's the opposite of what I want!

340
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:03,093
Quick, run out the back!

341
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,894
I'll hack into Inspector Five's terminal

342
00:18:04,962 --> 00:18:07,363
and fake your death,
so they'll call off the kill-bots.

343
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:09,399
You know that terminal is unhackable!

344
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:12,001
I'm not leaving you, and that's final!

345
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:13,269
Good luck, buddy.

346
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:26,149
Bender terminated.

347
00:18:26,217 --> 00:18:27,550
Bender's saved.

348
00:18:29,153 --> 00:18:31,087
Cease fire.

349
00:18:31,155 --> 00:18:32,755
Mom called off the attack,

350
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:34,624
although I don't see how it's her.

351
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:36,159
Someone said Howitzer!

352
00:18:37,962 --> 00:18:39,429
Yay!

353
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:41,131
All right! Yay!

354
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:45,034
Oh...

355
00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:55,578
He did it!

356
00:18:55,646 --> 00:18:57,247
And he's not looking back

357
00:18:57,314 --> 00:18:58,982
at that cool explosion.

358
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:01,117
He's a hero!

359
00:19:04,522 --> 00:19:06,890
What's happening?!

360
00:19:06,957 --> 00:19:10,293
The phone's been disconnected,
the ship's repossessed

361
00:19:10,361 --> 00:19:11,794
and Zoidberg's getting overcooked!

362
00:19:11,862 --> 00:19:13,363
Aw, aw, aw, aw!

363
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:17,000
Ah, this place never changes.

364
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:19,602
Leela, what in the name
of Jah happened?!

365
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,070
Too much papers!

366
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:23,306
Not enough hiding plants!

367
00:19:23,374 --> 00:19:24,674
It's all right.

368
00:19:24,742 --> 00:19:27,243
This place just needs
a one-hour bureaucratizing.

369
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:33,850
You make it look so easy.

370
00:19:33,918 --> 00:19:36,252
I've smoked a lot
a paperwork in my day.

371
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,622
Hey, Bender, did you ever find
that inspector guy you were looking for?

372
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,392
Nah. But thanks
to this knucklehead,

373
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:44,460
I did find a new outlook on life.

374
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:46,296
It's precious and sacred,

375
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:49,199
and you only get so many
millions of years on this Earth.

376
00:19:49,266 --> 00:19:50,867
So let's get brick-faced!

377
00:20:57,832 --> 00:21:00,503
