Fire.

Air.

4
00:00:13,107 --> 00:00:13,900
Water.

5
00:00:15,188 --> 00:00:18,960
Only the Avatar can master
all four elements

6
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:21,182
and bring balance to the world.

00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:29,457
the Red Lotus is
the world's newest threat.

9
00:00:29,569 --> 00:00:30,905
After confronting Zaheer,

10
00:00:30,926 --> 00:00:32,958
Korra learned he is part
of a secret society

11
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:37,039
whose mission is to take out all the
nation's leaders and destroy world order.

12
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:38,933
But before Korra
could warn anyone,

13
00:00:38,954 --> 00:00:41,749
she and Asami were apprehended
by the Earth queen's forces.

14
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,190
And the Red Lotus
nabbed Mako and Bolin.

15
00:00:44,317 --> 00:00:47,138
Now both parties are headed
toward Ba Sing Se.

16
00:00:47,644 --> 00:00:51,219
-

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,001
you have to let me out.

18
00:00:58,288 --> 00:01:00,917
The Earth queen is in danger
from a group of terrorists

19
00:01:00,938 --> 00:01:02,420
calling themselves
the Red Lotus.

20
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:05,206
I talked to one of them
in the spirit world yesterday.

21
00:01:05,227 --> 00:01:06,385
He's insane.

22
00:01:06,918 --> 00:01:08,990
Screaming about terrorists
in the spirit world?

23
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:11,209
You're the one
who sounds insane.

24
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,227
Do I have to be chained
to the floor the whole way?

25
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,689
It's going to be
so uncomfortable.

26
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:31,556
Sorry, ma'am.
I'm under orders.

27
00:01:32,257 --> 00:01:34,290
Can't you just chain me
to that railing?

28
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:36,278
I mean, where am I gonna go?

29
00:01:36,928 --> 00:01:38,044
Please.

30
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:42,610
Well, as long as you're chained up, I
guess it doesn't make a difference.

31
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:47,400
Thank you, Sir.

32
00:01:48,018 --> 00:01:50,635
- Can I have some water?
- No water.

33
00:01:50,896 --> 00:01:53,796
We're also not gonna bring you
any rocks or fire, so don't ask.

34
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:58,031
I guess there's air, but there's
nothing we can do about that.

35
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,224
We're not opening your compartment
until we reach Ba Sing Se.

36
00:02:03,063 --> 00:02:06,209
I hoped Mako and Bolin would
have shown up to save us by now.

37
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,720
I wonder if they're okay.

38
00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:12,767
If you think
holding us hostage

39
00:02:12,788 --> 00:02:14,821
will give you some leverage
to use against the Avatar,

40
00:02:15,227 --> 00:02:16,993
you're gonna be
very disappointed.

41
00:02:17,173 --> 00:02:19,907
Can't we just enjoy our time
together in silence?

42
00:02:20,082 --> 00:02:22,737
And why did you need
Korra alive back in Zaofu?

43
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:24,179
You had her paralyzed.

44
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:26,511
Why didn't you just take her out
when you had the chance?

45
00:02:26,736 --> 00:02:30,772
Look, all you need to know is that the
world is about to change, for the better.

46
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:34,196
So you guys were, like,
locked up for 15 years, huh?

47
00:02:34,443 --> 00:02:36,328
That must have been, like,
crazy boring.

48
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:39,768
Actually, it was only 13
years, but it felt like 30.

49
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:42,207
I mean, what did you do
with all that time?

50
00:02:42,284 --> 00:02:44,439
Did you sing songs,
work on crafts?

51
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:47,720
Not a lot of craft supplies
in a volcanic prison cell.

52
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:51,164
And I must have renamed the
constellations about a thousand times.

53
00:02:51,231 --> 00:02:53,613
When it rained,
that was a big event.

54
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:55,241
Oh, I would've killed
for some rain.

55
00:02:55,487 --> 00:02:57,747
Mostly I just made up stories
about the guards.

56
00:02:57,768 --> 00:02:59,553
Who was having trouble
with his girlfriend?

57
00:02:59,574 --> 00:03:02,190
Which one secretly wished
he'd become a pastry chef?

58
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,654
Ooh, okay, that sounds like fun.
Let me try that on you guys.

59
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:07,308
You were raised
by an older sister.

60
00:03:07,474 --> 00:03:09,844
Your mustache grew in
when you were ten.

61
00:03:09,943 --> 00:03:11,297
And I'm sensing... just sensing...

62
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:14,207
An unspoken attraction
between you two.

63
00:03:15,702 --> 00:03:17,544
Two out of three. Not bad.

64
00:03:17,735 --> 00:03:21,590
Bolin, will you stop making
friends with the bad guys?

65
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:22,733
Sorry.

66
00:03:22,813 --> 00:03:25,805
Ghazan, gag those two.
We're almost there.

67
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,530
We have to find a way out of this prison
before we get to the Earth queen.

68
00:03:37,971 --> 00:03:39,459
Don't worry. I have a plan.

69
00:03:39,662 --> 00:03:42,037
These airships that Cabbage Corp
sold to the Earth kingdom

70
00:03:42,038 --> 00:03:44,492
are way cheaper than the ones
Future Industries built.

71
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:56,673
Now, that's just
shoddy workmanship.

72
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:00,765
There's no way I can get
these locks off.

73
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,541
I need the keys.

74
00:04:08,687 --> 00:04:11,115
Give me five minutes,
then start yelling for help.

75
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:19,823
When is the Avatar
scheduled for delivery?

76
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:24,832
The airship already left fort Bosco and
should be arriving in a few hours.

77
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:26,084
Excellent.

78
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,558
Bring her to me
as soon as it lands.

79
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:30,303
Yes, your majesty.

80
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:35,110
But first there are some people here who
captured two of the Avatar's friends.

81
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:37,599
They would like to present them
to you personally.

82
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,423
You know I don't meet
with bounty hunters.

83
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:42,533
And of course
I told them that,

84
00:04:42,554 --> 00:04:45,654
but they say they have some
information that might interest you

85
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:48,784
about the location
of your stolen airbenders.

86
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:49,503
Really?

87
00:04:50,195 --> 00:04:51,606
Fine, send them in.

88
00:04:53,015 --> 00:04:54,719
Ah, yes.

89
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,501
I remember these two.

90
00:04:56,605 --> 00:05:01,398
We'll find an acceptable home for you in
prison with the rest of the dissidents.

91
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,594
Now I'm told you have
some information for me.

92
00:05:06,964 --> 00:05:11,051
I hope this isn't just some ruse
to try to increase your bounty.

93
00:05:11,202 --> 00:05:13,016
We don't want any bounty,
your majesty.

94
00:05:13,286 --> 00:05:15,408
You can consider these two
a thankyou gift

95
00:05:15,429 --> 00:05:17,450
for simply taking the time
to talk to us.

96
00:05:18,178 --> 00:05:20,659
How very magnanimous.

97
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:25,083
So where are my airbenders?

98
00:05:25,104 --> 00:05:28,396
I'd be happy to tell you once
you hand the Avatar over to me.

99
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:30,115
Who told you
that we have the Avatar?

100
00:05:30,294 --> 00:05:31,887
How I know is not important.

101
00:05:32,046 --> 00:05:34,483
But if I found out,
others will too.

102
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,051
And that could put you
in a difficult position.

103
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,179
Is that so?

104
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:41,770
Your Majesty,
imprisoning the Avatar

105
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:45,336
will cause the other nations to turn
against you and demand her freedom.

106
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:49,390
Before long, you'll be in the midst
of a sticky international incident.

107
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:51,107
But if you let me
take her today,

108
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:53,464
no one need ever know
she was here,

109
00:05:53,696 --> 00:05:56,423
and you can get your airbenders
back without interference.

110
00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:57,509
We both win.

111
00:05:57,701 --> 00:06:02,731
And what do you plan to do with the Avatar,
should I see fit to grant your request?

112
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:05,795
All I can say is that
I have business with her.

113
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:07,953
But she won't
be bothering you again.

114
00:06:08,096 --> 00:06:09,618
I can assure you of that.

115
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:17,193
I find these terms agreeable.

116
00:06:17,452 --> 00:06:22,422
Gun, escort them to the Antechamber
until the Avatar's arrival.

117
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:26,369
Send these two to the dungeon.

118
00:06:35,092 --> 00:06:37,049
Guard! Get in here!

119
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,770
Something happened to my friend!

120
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,029
She needs help!

121
00:06:40,697 --> 00:06:41,650
Where is she?

122
00:06:51,508 --> 00:06:52,472
Nice work.

123
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,606
Now let's take control
of this ship.

124
00:07:02,694 --> 00:07:03,867
Mayday, mayday.

125
00:07:03,888 --> 00:07:05,430
The Avatar has escaped.

126
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:08,079
We're going down in quadrant
four of the Si Wong desert.

127
00:07:12,177 --> 00:07:15,470
I think you might have been a little
overaggressive with the airbending.

128
00:07:15,743 --> 00:07:17,304
The controls are busted.

129
00:07:18,057 --> 00:07:19,583
Also, you broke the radio.

130
00:07:19,864 --> 00:07:23,159
Sorry, but it's not my fault
this airship's a hunk of junk.

131
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:24,977
Hang on to something!

132
00:07:38,295 --> 00:07:41,739
Well, they say any landing you can
walk away from is a good landing.

133
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,870
But given our location,

134
00:07:43,891 --> 00:07:45,243
I'm not so sure about that.

135
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,188
You're the engineer.
What do you think?

136
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:48,923
Can we get it flying again?

137
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:50,218
It doesn't look good.

138
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:53,035
I mean, even if you metalbend
the propellers back into shape,

139
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,102
we'd have to dig this
whole thing out of the sand.

140
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,647
Is everyone all right?

141
00:07:57,731 --> 00:07:58,706
Like you care.

142
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:00,260
What the heck happened?

143
00:08:00,535 --> 00:08:01,809
She said
her friend needed help.

144
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,103
Then they knocked me out!

145
00:08:03,237 --> 00:08:06,552
I'm sorry, but I couldn't let you take
me to the Earth queen as a captive.

146
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:09,852
There are dangerous forces at work
that you don't know anything about.

147
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,571
More dangerous than being
stranded in the desert?

148
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:13,950
Don't worry, Kong.

149
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:16,294
I radioed Ba Sing Se
before we went down.

150
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:17,992
We just need to sit tight.

151
00:08:18,194 --> 00:08:20,004
Someone will be here soon
to rescue us.

152
00:08:20,188 --> 00:08:21,669
I'm not waiting around
for that.

153
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,316
We need to get out of here now.

154
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:26,380
If we all work together, we might be
able to get the ship up and running.

155
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,627
Not likely.

156
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:30,566
I just tunneled out of the engine room.
It's like a sandbox in there.

157
00:08:30,754 --> 00:08:32,500
This ship
isn't going anywhere,

158
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:33,676
and neither are you.

159
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:37,413
You're our prisoners, and it's our duty
to transport you to the Earth queen.

160
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:39,388
You realize
that I'm the Avatar, right?

161
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:41,157
You don't wanna fight me.

162
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:43,250
I'm afraid you aren't
giving us much of a choice.

163
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,779
We have our orders.

164
00:08:46,473 --> 00:08:48,877
Wait, did that sand dune
just move?

165
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:50,716
It was probably just a mirage.

166
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,285
The desert will play
tricks on you.

167
00:08:52,463 --> 00:08:53,721
That's no mirage.

168
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,673
Look.

169
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,511
I heard that since all the spirits came
back, this desert has been haunted by them.

170
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:07,085
Oh, right, so I guess
that's my fault too.

171
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,947
Do you want to help us
get this ship up and running,

172
00:09:09,968 --> 00:09:12,222
or do you wanna wait around
and meet that thing?

173
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:14,610
We wanna fix the ship,
right, Cap?

174
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:18,240
Mm, let's get to work.

175
00:09:18,485 --> 00:09:19,954
Everybody, stand back!

176
00:09:32,848 --> 00:09:34,371
We have to find
a way out of here

177
00:09:34,392 --> 00:09:36,389
before Zaheer gets
his hands on Korra.

178
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:37,516
Take me with you.

179
00:09:37,662 --> 00:09:40,616
I haven't seen my wife
and five kids in four years.

180
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,291
Four years?

181
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:43,733
The first few months
were great.

182
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:45,361
I could finally get some sleep.

183
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:47,375
But now I really miss them.

184
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:51,286
Listen, Bolin,
this is up to you.

185
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:53,253
I know you can metalbend.

186
00:09:53,372 --> 00:09:54,604
You can metalbend?

187
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:56,601
No.

188
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:59,441
Yes, you can.
I believe in you.

189
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:00,966
I believe in you too, Bolin!

190
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:04,571
I appreciate that,
Mako and fellow prisoner man,

191
00:10:04,592 --> 00:10:07,323
but I've been trying
and trying and trying,

192
00:10:07,344 --> 00:10:09,957
and I've never been able
to do it... not even a little.

193
00:10:09,978 --> 00:10:11,760
You've always had
the ability deep down.

194
00:10:11,781 --> 00:10:13,595
You just haven't had
the right motivation.

195
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:15,334
But this is your time.

196
00:10:15,554 --> 00:10:17,299
Get us out of here
to save Korra.

197
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,360
You can do it!

198
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:20,766
Bolin! Bolin!

199
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:24,853
Bolin! Bolin! Bolin! Bolin!

200
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,389
You're right. Okay.

201
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:28,919
Here I go.

202
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:30,474
Metalbending!

203
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:31,512
Aghh!

204
00:10:40,776 --> 00:10:42,480
I can't metalbend.

205
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:44,989
Aww.

206
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:48,261
Hey, you guys didn't happen to
bring any toilet paper, did you?

207
00:11:22,885 --> 00:11:25,615
First you scare the life out of
me, now you want to lick me.

208
00:11:35,243 --> 00:11:37,753
Here. Chew on this,
and leave me alone.

209
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,979
- Tonraq, you read me?
- Yes. We copy.

210
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:45,484
I found Korra's jeep,
but the kids aren't here.

211
00:11:45,802 --> 00:11:47,818
Meet me
at the Misty Palms Oasis.

212
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,757
How's it looking in there?

213
00:11:58,921 --> 00:12:00,963
I just airbent all the sand
out of the engine room.

214
00:12:01,362 --> 00:12:02,286
I think it's clean.

215
00:12:02,494 --> 00:12:05,279
It hasn't been that clean since it
floated off the showroom floor.

216
00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:06,532
How's it going out here?

217
00:12:06,553 --> 00:12:08,221
Well, she's still
pretty banged up,

218
00:12:08,242 --> 00:12:10,477
but I think she might be able
to limp out of the desert.

219
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:12,787
Kong, you want to see if you can
get the engine started?

220
00:12:12,991 --> 00:12:13,887
Aye, aye.

221
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:20,390
All right!

222
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:33,384
Aah!

223
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,876
That's no spirit.

224
00:12:42,677 --> 00:12:43,949
I think it's gone for now.

225
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:46,346
Kong, are you all right?

226
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,158
What are we gonna do?

227
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,394
All of our supplies were on the ship.
We've got no food, no water.

228
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:54,185
Easy, Arik.
Another ship is on the way.

229
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:56,618
We just need to hold
our position for a few hours.

230
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,536
We might not have a few hours.

231
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,722
How far are we
from the edge of the desert?

232
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:03,121
Too far to walk,
if that's what you're thinking.

233
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:06,421
We can't just wait around for that
thing to pick us off one by one!

234
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:08,221
You'll do as you're told,
airman.

235
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:09,687
Now get ahold of yourself!

236
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:12,898
Maybe we can still build something
to get us all out of here.

237
00:13:13,023 --> 00:13:15,868
You wanna make some wings out of
scrap metal and flap real hard?

238
00:13:15,985 --> 00:13:20,621
No, but we might have enough material
to construct a makeshift sandsailer,

239
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,678
like the sandbenders
use to get around.

240
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:26,444
All we need is a sail and some
kind of sled to attach it to.

241
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:27,655
It's worth a try.

242
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:31,188
Gather every piece
of metal you can find.

243
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:33,975
We'll give that sandy beast
a run for his money yet.

244
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:40,843
Looks like he's in a hurry.
Wait here.

245
00:13:55,883 --> 00:14:00,169
Your Majesty, we received a distress signal
from the airship carrying the prisoners.

246
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:02,809
We believe the ship crashed
in the Si Wong desert

247
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:04,480
and the Avatar may have escaped.

248
00:14:04,584 --> 00:14:06,772
This is outrageous!

249
00:14:07,002 --> 00:14:10,676
Send another airship to retrieve
the Avatar immediately.

250
00:14:10,788 --> 00:14:12,841
It's already on its way,
your majesty.

251
00:14:15,697 --> 00:14:16,945
What are we going to do now?

252
00:14:17,317 --> 00:14:21,134
There's no way we can track her down in
the desert before the queen gets to her.

253
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:23,799
You really think they'll be lucky
enough to capture her again?

254
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:26,480
She'll be long gone
by the time they arrive.

255
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:29,258
It doesn't matter.
We're through chasing her.

256
00:14:29,447 --> 00:14:32,035
It's time to make her
come to us.

257
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:42,345
What is this riffraff doing
in my throne room unannounced?

258
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,524
Apologies, Your Majesty,

259
00:14:44,545 --> 00:14:48,080
but I couldn't help overhearing that
the Avatar won't be joining us today.

260
00:14:48,218 --> 00:14:51,167
The Avatar is still
in my custody.

261
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:56,958
However, eavesdropping on royal
conversations will land you in a cell

262
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,332
right next to those boys
you brought in.

263
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,087
Now, if you value your freedom,

264
00:15:03,248 --> 00:15:06,471
you'll tell me where
the airbenders are right now.

265
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:07,971
That wasn't the deal.

266
00:15:08,126 --> 00:15:10,784
I will not bandy words
with bounty hunters.

267
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:13,586
Seize these hoodlums
and throw them in prison

268
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:16,826
until they decide to show
proper respect for the crown!

269
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,258
Oof!

270
00:15:35,537 --> 00:15:36,519
Gun!

271
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:41,024
Get back here and lay down your
life for your queen, you coward!

272
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:50,021
You wouldn't dare
attack a queen!

273
00:15:53,976 --> 00:15:56,586
Maybe I forgot to mention
something to you.

274
00:15:57,615 --> 00:15:59,660
I don't believe in queens.

275
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,787
You think freedom is something
that you can give

276
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,719
or take on a whim,
but to your people,

277
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:22,651
freedom is just
as essential as air.

278
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:27,449
And without it,
there is no life.

279
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:29,294
There is only...

280
00:16:30,753 --> 00:16:32,167
Darkness.

281
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,554
Hey, you can't be in here.

282
00:16:42,713 --> 00:16:43,918
No need for alarm.

283
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:46,581
I just need to make an
announcement to the entire city.

284
00:16:46,677 --> 00:16:47,642
How do I do that?

285
00:16:47,762 --> 00:16:48,878
Who do you think you are?

286
00:16:50,372 --> 00:16:52,405
He's the man who just
took down the Earth queen.

287
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:53,872
You wanna be next?

288
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:55,398
Minghua, please.

289
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:57,985
We're here to help citizens
like him, not hurt them.

290
00:16:58,482 --> 00:17:00,493
Now, can you help me?

291
00:17:10,226 --> 00:17:12,603
Attention,
citizens of Ba Sing Se.

292
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,977
I have an important announcement
to make.

293
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,771
Moments ago, the Earth queen
was brought down

294
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:20,965
at the hands of revolutionaries,
including myself.

295
00:17:21,254 --> 00:17:22,999
I'm not going
to tell you my name,

296
00:17:23,186 --> 00:17:25,084
'cause my identity's
not important.

297
00:17:25,426 --> 00:17:27,880
I'm not here to take over
the Earth kingdom.

298
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:31,037
I think you've had enough of
leaders telling you what to do.

299
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:34,183
It's time for you
to find your own path.

300
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,218
No longer will you
be oppressed by tyrants.

301
00:17:37,444 --> 00:17:39,417
From now on, you are free.

302
00:17:39,812 --> 00:17:41,844
I deliver Ba Sing Se

303
00:17:41,865 --> 00:17:44,341
back into the hands
of the people.

304
00:18:17,298 --> 00:18:19,145
We have to get out of here,
Bolin.

305
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:23,289
Zaheer came here to take out the
Earth queen, and now Korra is next.

306
00:18:23,915 --> 00:18:26,145
You know that guy?
He's my hero!

307
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,183
Shut up!

308
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,722
You have to metalbend us
out of here.

309
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:31,784
Come on, I know you can do it!

310
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:33,352
This is your time!

311
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:35,487
You said before was my time.

312
00:18:35,508 --> 00:18:37,793
I know I did,
but now it's really your time.

313
00:18:39,262 --> 00:18:40,177
Do it!

314
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,756
Did you see that? I did it!

315
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:54,523
I mean, not for us, but I metalbent
all the other cells open!

316
00:18:54,832 --> 00:18:56,761
I don't think that was you.

317
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:02,974
Listen to me.

318
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:06,430
I'm going to set you free,
but I want to talk to you first.

319
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:09,963
I have a message that
I need you to take to Korra.

320
00:19:18,894 --> 00:19:21,112
She ain't pretty,
but I think she'll do the job.

321
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:23,629
No time for a test run.
Let's move!

322
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,963
I think he's gone. We did it!

323
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:33,185
You want to buy
a slightly used sandsailer?

324
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:38,350
Thanks, Asami. You've got
a good head on your shoulders.

325
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:40,684
I'm sorry for getting us
stranded out there.

326
00:20:40,685 --> 00:20:42,122
I didn't mean
for that to happen.

327
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:45,117
You know, whatever the conflict
between you and the queen is,

328
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:47,373
I'm sure it's above my pay grade.

329
00:20:47,802 --> 00:20:49,110
You got a tough job.

330
00:20:49,836 --> 00:20:51,538
Good luck, Avatar.

331
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:54,843
Captain, have we been
in the desert too long,

332
00:20:54,864 --> 00:20:57,042
or is that really
a dragon over there?

333
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:01,221
Ugh. Let's go get a drink.

334
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:06,654
Ah!

335
00:21:09,136 --> 00:21:10,373
Easy, girl.

336
00:21:10,544 --> 00:21:12,393
Did you think we weren't
coming back for you?

337
00:21:19,584 --> 00:21:20,804
What are you all doing here?

338
00:21:20,984 --> 00:21:22,502
Korra, you're safe.

339
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,111
Yeah, we made it out of the
desert, thanks to Asami.

340
00:21:27,972 --> 00:21:29,489
Do you remember Lord Zuko?

341
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:32,028
I met you when you were
a very young girl.

342
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,871
It's good to see you again,
Avatar Korra.

343
00:21:35,138 --> 00:21:36,941
It's good to see you,
Lord Zuko.

344
00:21:37,092 --> 00:21:39,108
Thanks for ditching me
back at Zaofu.

345
00:21:39,261 --> 00:21:43,006
Yeah, sorry about that.
But how did you all find us?

346
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:45,057
I am a detective, you know.

347
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:47,108
Did you find Mako and Bolin?

348
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,295
Some people at the inn saw them
get captured by Zaheer's crew.

349
00:21:50,316 --> 00:21:51,425
We don't know where they are.

350
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:53,066
Did you hear
about the Earth queen?

351
00:21:53,087 --> 00:21:53,869
What about her?

352
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,021
<i>Once again,
the Earth queen's reign</i>

353
00:21:56,042 --> 00:21:58,202
<i>has come to an abrupt
and violent end.</i>

354
00:21:58,223 --> 00:22:00,921
<i>Ba Sing Se has descended
into chaos.</i>

355
00:22:00,942 --> 00:22:03,816
<i>Rioters and looters
have overrun the palace.</i>

356
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,432
- The Red Lotus.
- What's that?

357
00:22:06,571 --> 00:22:08,669
The name of the group
that's been trying to capture me

358
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,383
and just took out
the Earth queen.

359
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:13,641
I'm afraid this is only
the beginning, dad.

360
