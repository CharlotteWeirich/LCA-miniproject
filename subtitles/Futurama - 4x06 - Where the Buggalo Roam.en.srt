1
00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:09,483  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:490 Y2:516
Where the Buggalo Roam

2
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:45,725  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:061 Y2:126
- Yes?
- Hi, Dad! It's me and my coworkers.

3
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:49,249  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:061 Y2:126
Open up, Leo.
It's Amy and her weirdoes.

4
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:52,291  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:490 Y2:516
Howdy, friends! Welcome to Mars!

5
00:00:54,173 --> 00:00:58,485  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:061 Y2:127
Thanks for inviting us. I've never
been to a Mars Day barbecue.

6
00:00:58,653 --> 00:01:02,043  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:061 Y2:126
Mars Day better than Earth Day.
Dump trash anywhere.

7
00:01:02,213 --> 00:01:05,683  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:061 Y2:126
- Big, empty planet.
- Okay! Make yourselves at home.

8
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:07,764  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:489 Y2:516
Don't mind if I already did.

9
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:11,209  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:061 Y2:126
Do you have any more
Dom Perignon bubble bath?

10
00:01:11,373 --> 00:01:15,048  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:451 Y2:516
There was only enough
to fill the tub halfway.

11
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:20,649  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:061 Y2:087
Quite a large ranch you have.

12
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:24,806  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:061 Y2:126
1 7.9 billion acres. We own
entire Western Hemisphere.

13
00:01:24,973 --> 00:01:28,283  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:061 Y2:121
- That the best hemisphere.
- It's the same on Earth.

14
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:34,488  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
Here is most number one product.
The mighty Buggalo.

15
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:38,532  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:061 Y2:121
Used for everything. Meat, milk.
Their shells make rowboats.

16
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,770  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:490 Y2:516
I broke your television!

17
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:43,647  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:061 Y2:082
It must take forever to brand them.

18
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:49,331  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:061 Y2:126
Not really. We own so much, it easier
to brand everything that not ours.

19
00:01:50,973 --> 00:01:52,804  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:061 Y2:083
Please don't do that.

20
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:56,412  X1:284 X2:431 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hey! Betsy!

21
00:01:57,893 --> 00:02:02,444  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:061 Y2:126
This is my sweet Betsy. I raised her
from a larva that ate my sweater.

22
00:02:02,613 --> 00:02:07,323  X1:100 X2:614 Y1:061 Y2:127
We going to eat her at Amy's wedding.
If she ever get married.

23
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:09,211  X1:276 X2:440 Y1:061 Y2:082
Dad! Gleesh!

24
00:02:09,373 --> 00:02:12,251  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:061 Y2:127
Don't say that when
you meet my boyfriend.

25
00:02:12,413 --> 00:02:16,088  X1:171 X2:543 Y1:451 Y2:516
Oh, that right. We get to
spend time with this Mr. Kif.

26
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:19,484  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:516
I hope he's a nice man
who can make grandchildren.

27
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:23,089  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:451 Y2:516
This not a parallel universe
where you get younger.

28
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:36,485  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:451 Y2:516
Remember, the quickest way to
a girl's bed is through her parents.

29
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:42,011  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Have sex with them, and you're in.
- I'm nervous about meeting her family.

30
00:02:42,173 --> 00:02:45,131  X1:154 X2:560 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's natural.
You're meek and uninteresting.

31
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:47,932  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:450 Y2:516
You've gotten by
on my leftover charisma.

32
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:50,653  X1:234 X2:481 Y1:451 Y2:516
Scrounging off it,
like a tiny parasite.

33
00:02:50,813 --> 00:02:52,132  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:490 Y2:516
I hope they like me.

34
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:56,206  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:450 Y2:516
Why wouldn't they? Yes, I know.
Tiny, meek, uninteresting.

35
00:02:56,373 --> 00:03:00,651  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:454 Y2:516
Spare me your tedious story, Kif.
And above all, have fun!

36
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:06,931  X1:269 X2:445 Y1:495 Y2:516
Get on down!

37
00:03:07,693 --> 00:03:11,766  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:454 Y2:516
Oh, yeah! Drop another barnyard
bomb on us, Vanilla Corn!

38
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:14,891  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:492 Y2:516
Yo, fool! It's Mix-Master Festus.

39
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:30,485  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:489 Y2:516
So, what's Mars Day about?

40
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:34,692  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:451 Y2:516
It commemorate the day when
our ancestor, Sir Reginald Wong...

41
00:03:34,853 --> 00:03:37,128  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:490 Y2:516
...bought Mars from stupid natives.

42
00:03:37,293 --> 00:03:39,488  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:490 Y2:516
How can you call them stupid?

43
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:44,090  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
They sell whole planet for one bead.
Sound stupid to me.

44
00:03:44,253 --> 00:03:45,322  X1:264 X2:450 Y1:490 Y2:516
That is stupid!

45
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:50,123  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:450 Y2:516
I can't believe you laugh at exploiting
a proud, bead-loving people.

46
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:52,011  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:489 Y2:516
Lighten up. It's funny.

47
00:03:52,173 --> 00:03:54,767  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:451 Y2:516
Of course.
But you don't have to laugh!

48
00:03:57,573 --> 00:03:59,962  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:489 Y2:516
No. Not on your parents' planet.

49
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:03,125  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:450 Y2:516
Glad to see you've come
back to the country.

50
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:05,329  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:494 Y2:516
It's where the flavor is.

51
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:07,843  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:490 Y2:516
R.J., this is my boyfriend, Kif.

52
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:11,244  X1:154 X2:560 Y1:451 Y2:516
This wimp?
You've gone a long way, baby.

53
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:14,564  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:454 Y2:516
- Cigarette, partner?
- Oh, I don't...

54
00:04:16,493 --> 00:04:19,963  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:455 Y2:516
- I haven't even lit it yet.
- Oh. Is it lit now?

55
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:21,612  X1:329 X2:386 Y1:490 Y2:516
Yep.

56
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:25,242  X1:254 X2:461 Y1:489 Y2:516
You're pathetic.

57
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:30,048  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:451 Y2:516
Host man. Host woman.
I'm having a wonderful time!

58
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:36,243  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:451 Y2:516
You here five hours, already you tear
up couch and fill pool with shrimp!

59
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:38,847  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:490 Y2:516
Not bad for a city boy, huh?

60
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:43,450  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:451 Y2:516
By the way, I took the liberty
of fertilizing your caviar.

61
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:59,292  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:451 Y2:516
Relax.
I'm sure my parents will love you.

62
00:04:59,453 --> 00:05:04,652  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:516
When I get nervous, I can't control
my camouflage reflex.

63
00:05:04,813 --> 00:05:08,772  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:454 Y2:516
Oh, dear. Oh, goodness.
Oh, odds and bodkins.

64
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:12,323  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:455 Y2:516
- I'll have a thorax and feelers.
- You want salad?

65
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:13,687  X1:321 X2:393 Y1:495 Y2:516
Yuck!

66
00:05:13,853 --> 00:05:16,287  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:495 Y2:516
Mom? Dad? You remember Kif.

67
00:05:16,453 --> 00:05:21,243  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:451 Y2:516
- I have instant dislike of him.
- Too scrawny to father grandchildren.

68
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:24,086  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:450 Y2:516
He's not scrawny,
he's just small-boned.

69
00:05:24,253 --> 00:05:26,323  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:489 Y2:516
Actually, I don't have bones.

70
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,451  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm supported
by fluid-filled bladders that...

71
00:05:29,613 --> 00:05:33,572  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
You a big, squishy wuss.
Amy should date real man. Like him!

72
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:40,368  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:451 Y2:516
I can be manly too.
I think I'll light up a smoke.

73
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:42,885  X1:279 X2:435 Y1:490 Y2:516
Wrong way.

74
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,732  X1:304 X2:411 Y1:495 Y2:516
Smooth.

75
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:49,445  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:490 Y2:516
Look on the bright side.

76
00:05:49,613 --> 00:05:54,084  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
My parents left after you passed out,
so they didn't see you barf.

77
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:58,769  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:450 Y2:516
Now they'll never think I'm manly
enough to date their daughter.

78
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,644  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:489 Y2:516
It's okay, Kif.

79
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:04,693  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'll go get you a tissue
from your tote.

80
00:06:04,853 --> 00:06:07,970  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:451 Y2:516
Hey there, Amy.
Like you to meet my buddy, Joe.

81
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:12,604  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:516
Sorry I'm late. My pool game
ran long at the jazz club.

82
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:14,961  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:495 Y2:516
Kids love him.

83
00:06:19,453 --> 00:06:21,409  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:494 Y2:516
What's that weird sound?

84
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,962  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:451 Y2:516
Dust storm! Oh, dust storm!
Everybody into house.

85
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:30,443  X1:188 X2:526 Y1:451 Y2:516
Hurry before we die.
And wipe your damn feet!

86
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:36,292  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:451 Y2:516
Everyone okay?
No one considering lawsuit?

87
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:39,444  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:490 Y2:516
I might have mental anguish.

88
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:43,242  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I'm friends with every judge here.
- I'm okay, then.

89
00:06:43,413 --> 00:06:46,803  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:451 Y2:516
Storm dying down.
Check if Buggalo herd is okay.

90
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:58,048  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Where are the Buggalo?
- Rustled under cover of storm!

91
00:06:58,213 --> 00:07:01,728  X1:283 X2:432 Y1:456 Y2:516
- We ruined!
- No!

92
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:05,082  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:489 Y2:516
Don't worry, Daddy. It'll be okay.

93
00:07:05,253 --> 00:07:07,323  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:490 Y2:516
Oh, really? Who gonna save us?

94
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,405  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:451 Y2:516
One-eye? Lobster mooch?
Drunken garbage can?

95
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:14,282  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:456 Y2:516
- This sounds like a job for...
- Lt. Kif Kroker!

96
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:16,045  X1:263 X2:451 Y1:490 Y2:516
All right, then.

97
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:27,609  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:451 Y2:516
Those Buggalo were what made
Wong family so rich and powerful.

98
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:30,606  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:456 Y2:516
Oh, Inez, we damn stolen!
We ruined!

99
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:32,252  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:490 Y2:516
Okay, I want a divorce.

100
00:07:32,413 --> 00:07:35,405  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:494 Y2:516
Mom! Dad! Don't ask me to choose!

101
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:40,812  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:516
They're not your parents. I'm not your
sister. And that's not your golf cart.

102
00:07:44,373 --> 00:07:48,161  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
Everybody calm down.
Kif promised to catch the rustlers.

103
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:58,045  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:456 Y2:516
Mrs. Wong, could I borrow
a neckerchief?

104
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,091  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:451 Y2:516
My plan is to take
the remaining Buggalo...

105
00:08:03,253 --> 00:08:05,972  X1:205 X2:509 Y1:451 Y2:516
...and lead them
on a tough cattle drive.

106
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:09,443  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:456 Y2:516
When rustlers attack,
I'll make a citizen's arrest.

107
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:12,366  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:451 Y2:516
Sounds dangerous.
Someone could get killed.

108
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,491  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:451 Y2:516
Fry? Leela? Bender?
I want you to go with him.

109
00:08:15,653 --> 00:08:17,052  X1:299 X2:416 Y1:493 Y2:516
Oh, man.

110
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:22,408  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:516
Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Wong. I'll
get your cattle back, or die trying.

111
00:08:22,573 --> 00:08:23,562  X1:263 X2:451 Y1:494 Y2:516
We can't lose!

112
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:28,249  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:516
No, it's too risky! You don't have
to do this to prove you're a man.

113
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:29,562  X1:243 X2:472 Y1:490 Y2:516
Oh, yes, he does!

114
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:32,570  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:490 Y2:516
Here are your mounts.

115
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:35,966  X1:216 X2:498 Y1:489 Y2:516
She's got a fine coat.

116
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:39,921  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
We need Buggalo to lure the rustlers.
How many are left?

117
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:42,687  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:489 Y2:516
Betsy's the only one left.

118
00:08:42,853 --> 00:08:46,163  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:451 Y2:516
She was curled up in my
hamper when the storm hit.

119
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:49,449  X1:237 X2:478 Y1:490 Y2:516
Aw, she likes you.

120
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:55,402  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:451 Y2:516
Saddle up, men! We got some
no-good rustlers to catch!

121
00:09:02,653 --> 00:09:05,963  X1:138 X2:585 Y1:456 Y2:516
<i>We got a right to pick a little fight</i>
<i>With rustlers</i>

122
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:11,002  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Somebody wants to pick a fight with us</i>
<i>He better bite my ass</i>

123
00:09:11,173 --> 00:09:16,247  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:451 Y2:516
Wow! Look at that! Olympus Mons! The
tallest volcano in the solar system.

124
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:18,369  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Where?
- Right in front of you.

125
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:20,251  X1:308 X2:407 Y1:495 Y2:516
Oh. Oh!

126
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:23,610  X1:196 X2:518 Y1:450 Y2:516
We'll camp at the top.
The rustlers will spot us.

127
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:24,762  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:495 Y2:516
Where?

128
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:30,370  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:451 Y2:516
And even though the computer
was off and unplugged...

129
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:35,004  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:456 Y2:516
...an image stayed on the screen.
It was...

130
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:37,448  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:490 Y2:516
...the Windows logo!

131
00:09:37,613 --> 00:09:40,844  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:450 Y2:516
- That's not scary!
- It is if you're a printer!

132
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:45,803  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:451 Y2:516
Okay, my turn to tell a ghost story.
Once, there was this woman driving...

133
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:49,727  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Hook on the hand!
- Okay, I've got one. This family...

134
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:51,087  X1:251 X2:464 Y1:495 Y2:516
Man in the attic!

135
00:09:51,253 --> 00:09:54,802  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:451 Y2:516
Mr. Know-it-all-about-something,
finally! Tell a story.

136
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:56,486  X1:264 X2:450 Y1:490 Y2:516
With pleasure.

137
00:09:56,653 --> 00:10:02,205  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:451 Y2:516
Once, not far from here,
four people set out on a cattle drive.

138
00:10:02,373 --> 00:10:05,729  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:451 Y2:516
Bored robot kills Fry with a hammer!
Sorry, go on.

139
00:10:06,213 --> 00:10:09,569  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:451 Y2:516
While they sat helplessly
around the campfire...

140
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:13,442  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:451 Y2:516
...a demented, lunatic,
libertarian zombie snuck up...

141
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,331  X1:300 X2:414 Y1:490 Y2:516
Surprise!

142
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:19,484  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:490 Y2:516
Amy, what are you doing here?

143
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:23,009  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:456 Y2:516
- I forgot to give you something.
- Oh. What?

144
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:30,485  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:451 Y2:516
Is that your camouflage reflex,
or are you just happy to see me?

145
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:34,923  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:451 Y2:516
I love it out here, Amy.
I feel so manly.

146
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:40,372  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:451 Y2:516
I have a blister, I spit, and,
of course, I tell no one my feelings.

147
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:42,763  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:456 Y2:516
- But you still have them?
- Yes.

148
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:47,131  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:451 Y2:516
But I keep them inside until
I can write them in my diary.

149
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:50,365  X1:209 X2:507 Y1:455 Y2:516
- It's a wonderful night.
- It sure is.

150
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:54,128  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:451 Y2:516
I could lie beside you,
staring at the sky, all night.

151
00:10:54,293 --> 00:10:55,806  X1:312 X2:403 Y1:494 Y2:516
I can't.

152
00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:04,723  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:450 Y2:516
- What's that?
- Maybe we just made love.

153
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:10,563  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:490 Y2:516
The Buggalo are in the crater!

154
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:13,247  X1:209 X2:507 Y1:456 Y2:516
The rustlers must have
seen me and ran!

155
00:11:13,413 --> 00:11:17,008  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Oh, Kif. You're so brave!
- They'll hear us.

156
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,169  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:489 Y2:516
Okay, the dynamite's in place.

157
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,608  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:489 Y2:516
There's no other way to do it?

158
00:11:25,773 --> 00:11:29,083  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:451 Y2:516
Only if your parents have
thousands of helicopters.

159
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:31,926  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Actually...
- Too late! This is more fun!

160
00:11:36,413 --> 00:11:40,042  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
Kif, you did it! How did you know
dynamite would work?

161
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:43,762  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:456 Y2:516
I took a seminar in ejecting
chickens from a sand dune.

162
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:47,005  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:456 Y2:516
The principle is essentially
the same.

163
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:51,324  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:516
Hey, it's that "barbecue's over"
sound again!

164
00:11:53,573 --> 00:11:54,972  X1:284 X2:430 Y1:495 Y2:516
Sandstorm!

165
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,803  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:455 Y2:516
- We're in the eye of the storm!
- Where?

166
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:10,811  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:494 Y2:516
What's that?

167
00:12:12,613 --> 00:12:14,410  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Oh, my gosh!
- Who are they?

168
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,042  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:495 Y2:516
We are the native Martians.

169
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:21,563  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:489 Y2:516
I didn't know Buggalo could fly.

170
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:24,486  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:451 Y2:516
Those who revere Mother Mars
can fly them.

171
00:12:24,653 --> 00:12:27,292  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:451 Y2:516
Only they shall have Buggalo.
They're us.

172
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:31,287  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:451 Y2:516
But your Martian-ness,
these Buggalo aren't yours.

173
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:33,489  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:490 Y2:516
They belong to the Wong family.

174
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:37,885  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:451 Y2:516
You mean family that took all land
and gave us a lousy bead?

175
00:12:38,053 --> 00:12:40,203  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:490 Y2:516
Uh-huh. Amy Wong. And you are?

176
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:44,207  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
Mad at Wong family! We plan to ruin
them by stealing Buggalo.

177
00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:47,012  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:490 Y2:516
But now we take girl instead.

178
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:50,649  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:489 Y2:516
Wait! I'm too rich to be kidnapped!

179
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:53,725  X1:297 X2:418 Y1:490 Y2:516
Amy! No!

180
00:12:56,413 --> 00:12:57,687  X1:249 X2:466 Y1:489 Y2:516
Don't worry, Kif.

181
00:12:57,853 --> 00:13:02,529  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm sure some other beautiful
rich girl will fall in love with you.

182
00:13:18,653 --> 00:13:20,609  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hooray! You bring back cattle!

183
00:13:20,773 --> 00:13:24,766  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:516
Yes. But I'm afraid
I've got some bad news as well.

184
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:28,164  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:451 Y2:516
Let Amy tell us.
That way it soften the blow.

185
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:31,525  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:490 Y2:516
Why Amy being so quiet?

186
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:34,882  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:495 Y2:516
Well... That is...

187
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:43,290  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:061 Y2:087
Oh, no! Martians kidnap Amy!

188
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:46,843  X1:175 X2:539 Y1:061 Y2:126
It them.
They no use good grammar.

189
00:13:47,013 --> 00:13:50,403  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I'll get your daughter back.
- Forget it, squishy.

190
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:52,803  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:490 Y2:516
You lose her. You done enough.

191
00:13:52,973 --> 00:13:57,205  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:456 Y2:516
This time we get most decorated
lawman in the whole universe!

192
00:13:57,373 --> 00:14:00,570  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:451 Y2:516
You mean...?
Oh, no, please, I beg you. For the...

193
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:05,932  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:451 Y2:516
I am the man with no name.
Zapp Brannigan, at your service.

194
00:14:06,293 --> 00:14:09,808  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:451 Y2:516
Please, we need you go
get our daughter back!

195
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:15,286  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'll clean up Kif's mess. I shall go
bargain with the Martians personally.

196
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:18,968  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Your gasps intrigue me.
- Martians have no land.

197
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:22,762  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:451 Y2:516
They been encouraged to live
on reservation underground.

198
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:25,003  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:490 Y2:516
No one ever dare go there.

199
00:14:25,173 --> 00:14:29,132  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:456 Y2:516
This mission is very dangerous!
Someone's sure to be killed!

200
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:33,286  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Fry? Leela? Bender?
- Damn you, old man!

201
00:14:38,773 --> 00:14:42,482  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:490 Y2:516
Aw, look. Betsy followed you, Kif.

202
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:47,485  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:450 Y2:516
I didn't realize you were bringing
your girlfriend, lieutenant.

203
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,803  X1:184 X2:530 Y1:494 Y2:516
She won't leave me alone.

204
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:54,046  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:456 Y2:516
Did I say girlfriend?
She sounds more like a wife.

205
00:15:02,773 --> 00:15:05,446  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:490 Y2:516
Behold! The great stone face of Mars!

206
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:10,843  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:451 Y2:516
- The only entrance to the reservation.
- What about the great stone ass?

207
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:13,766  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:450 Y2:516
But it's on the other side
of the planet.

208
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:18,762  X1:264 X2:451 Y1:493 Y2:516
Noseward, ho!

209
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:41,206  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:456 Y2:516
I am Singing Wind.
Chief of the Martian tribe.

210
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,443  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:490 Y2:516
Take me to your leader.

211
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:46,766  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:451 Y2:516
Moving along.
Why you trespass on our land?

212
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:49,208  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:489 Y2:516
To negotiate Amy Wong's release.

213
00:15:49,373 --> 00:15:54,208  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:451 Y2:516
And just to clarify, land is the stuff
that has sky over it.

214
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:02,764  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
- They have respect for the planet.
- Cynthia used to drink Slurm.

215
00:16:04,453 --> 00:16:07,206  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:450 Y2:516
We'll give girl
when we get planet surface.

216
00:16:07,373 --> 00:16:09,887  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:455 Y2:516
- How do we know she's alive?
- I'm fine.

217
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:13,887  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:450 Y2:516
Don't weaken our bargaining power.
What if you give her up...

218
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:16,931  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:451 Y2:516
...and we carve presidents
in your mountain?

219
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:20,642  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:456 Y2:516
You waste words. We want land
that was taken from us.

220
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,122  X1:136 X2:578 Y1:490 Y2:516
Actually, you traded it for a bead.

221
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:26,729  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:455 Y2:516
Tribe suffer heap big buyer's remorse.
We want land!

222
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:30,124  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:456 Y2:516
My people are people of law.
And that law is:

223
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:31,692  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:495 Y2:516
No backsies.

224
00:16:31,853 --> 00:16:35,163  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:456 Y2:516
The time for stupid statements
is over.

225
00:16:38,973 --> 00:16:40,725  X1:303 X2:413 Y1:490 Y2:516
Oh, boy.

226
00:16:50,053 --> 00:16:51,805  X1:307 X2:408 Y1:490 Y2:516
My eye!

227
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:04,169  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:490 Y2:516
Ma! Pa! Our precious ranch!

228
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:19,972  X1:196 X2:518 Y1:489 Y2:516
Amy! No! It's too windy!

229
00:17:25,773 --> 00:17:28,333  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:489 Y2:516
Stay calm, dearest! I'll save you!

230
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:34,689  X1:226 X2:490 Y1:455 Y2:516
- You're flying Betsy!
- Need a lift?

231
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:40,608  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:490 Y2:516
Great Mother Mars! He has the gift.

232
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:47,372  X1:290 X2:426 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Yeah, Kif!
- All right!

233
00:17:47,573 --> 00:17:51,122  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:451 Y2:516
Kroker, that was one
Brannigan-esque feat of heroism.

234
00:17:51,293 --> 00:17:55,047  X1:159 X2:555 Y1:451 Y2:516
We misjudged you, green one.
You fly the Buggalo like us.

235
00:17:55,213 --> 00:17:57,488  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:495 Y2:516
You have reverence for Mother Mars.

236
00:17:57,653 --> 00:18:02,363  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Let there be peace between us.
- Yes. Let us smoke-em peace pipe.

237
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:03,932  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:495 Y2:516
Smoke-em?

238
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,322  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:493 Y2:516
Here, take.

239
00:18:08,493 --> 00:18:10,961  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:489 Y2:516
No thanks. I'm on the peace patch.

240
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:14,921  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:451 Y2:516
You must smoke peace pipe, peacefully.
Or we'll kill you.

241
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:17,971  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:455 Y2:516
Well, it's just really
that I don't feel...

242
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:19,486  X1:231 X2:484 Y1:494 Y2:516
Don't be a chicken.

243
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:23,612  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:451 Y2:516
Teenagers all smoke,
and they seem pretty on the ball.

244
00:18:27,893 --> 00:18:29,929  X1:254 X2:461 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Yeah!
- Way to suck it!

245
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:34,245  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:489 Y2:516
Hey, I'm smoking! I'm the greatest!

246
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:41,451  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:490 Y2:516
Oh, monkey trumpets!

247
00:18:43,293 --> 00:18:46,683  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:451 Y2:516
You coughed at our offer of peace,
so you must die.

248
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:51,404  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:451 Y2:516
The bead used to crush our dreams
shall be used to crush your bones.

249
00:18:51,573 --> 00:18:53,450  X1:232 X2:483 Y1:494 Y2:516
I don't have bones.

250
00:18:53,613 --> 00:18:57,288  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:455 Y2:516
I'm supported by a system
of fluid-filled bladders that...

251
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,365  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's the bead
you traded your land for?

252
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:07,730  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:455 Y2:516
It's a huge diamond!
It must be worth a fortune!

253
00:19:07,893 --> 00:19:09,372  X1:314 X2:404 Y1:490 Y2:516
Really?

254
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:22,043  X1:165 X2:549 Y1:450 Y2:516
Oh, chief, you've made me
the happiest girl in the world!

255
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:25,723  X1:184 X2:530 Y1:456 Y2:516
If you want your land,
we could trade back for it.

256
00:19:26,653 --> 00:19:29,372  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:456 Y2:516
We assumed our ancestors
were cheated...

257
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:32,491  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:451 Y2:516
...because they not have concept
of ownership.

258
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:38,046  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:451 Y2:516
- So we can have the diamond?
- No. We do have concept of ownership.

259
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:41,569  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:451 Y2:516
You can go. Sorry about
the rustling and kidnapping.

260
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:44,372  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:454 Y2:516
- And your sacred land?
- Land, schmand!

261
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:47,093  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:450 Y2:516
We don't want to live here.
It's a dump.

262
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:51,724  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:516
We'll buy new planet and act like
it's sacred. Who's gonna argue?

263
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:53,372  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:489 Y2:516
Nobody, that's who!

264
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:05,602  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:451 Y2:516
Kif flew Betsy, rescued me,
and made peace with the Martians.

265
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:07,570  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:490 Y2:516
He too much of a wimp.

266
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:10,930  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:450 Y2:516
Yeah. I'm sure it was all
Mr. Zapp Brannigan here.

267
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:13,607  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:490 Y2:516
Please, you give me too little credit.

268
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:18,732  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:516
Captain Brannigan, you're always
welcome at Rancho Zoidberg.

269
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:24,287  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:453 Y2:516
Money doesn't make good people!
No, sir!

270
00:20:28,573 --> 00:20:31,929  X1:161 X2:553 Y1:451 Y2:516
Thanks for saving my life, Kif.
You're my hero.

271
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:36,086  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:516
Oh, you're kind.
But your parents still don't like me.

272
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:40,371  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:451 Y2:516
Well, gloviously. But if they
liked you, then I wouldn't.

273
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:43,570  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:489 Y2:516
Don't you know anything about girls?

274
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:58,726  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:455 Y2:516
"Dear diary, I just made love
for the second time."
