1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,100
Earth

2
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,050
Fire

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,700
Air

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,500
Water

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,200
Only the Avatar can master all four elements
...

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,400
And bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,875
<i>Republic City became
a war zone.</i>

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,250
<i>While Prince
saved the remaining citizens</i>

9
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:33,525
<i>The Avatar team fighting
the mecca giant.</i>

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,750
<i>But no dominant
the tips.</i>

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,650
<i>In the latest attempt,
Asami and her father</i>

12
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:40,225
<i>They used their costumes mecca-
to cut platinum.</i>

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,200
<i>Hiroshi helped Avatar
team to infiltrate the mecca giant,</i>

14
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:44,875
<i>But he paid a very high price.</i>

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,250
<i>This victory will strengthen
our heroes?</i>

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,100
BALANCE BOOK 4 CHAPTER 11
"The FINAL CONFRONTATION"

17
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,200
Initiate the lock.

18
00:01:20,225 --> 00:01:22,625
Find the Avatar
and who else is with her.

19
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,050
We need to act quickly.

20
00:01:25,075 --> 00:01:27,975
Su Lin, rise to the arm
try and disable the gun.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,750
Mako, Bolin,
go to the engine

22
00:01:29,775 --> 00:01:31,450
And try to turn off the power.

23
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:33,875
- I behind Kuvira.
- Are you sure?

24
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:36,250
- When you fought with her before...
- I know.

25
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,000
It almost destroyed me.

26
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,950
Not this time.

27
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,400
I will deal with this lever.
With each other.

28
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,900
I treat this type.
Disable the gun.

29
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:01,950
- Good job.
- The outside is of platinum

30
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:04,125
But we can cause a lot of damage here.

31
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,250
The loading system is not operating.

32
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:11,725
- We are unable to shoot.
- It is not malfunction.

33
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,100
I'm someone to bend the metal
within arm.

34
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:22,275
I lost the connection.
The gun became useless.

35
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,050
- I'm ready!
- I'll be with you in a second.

36
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:49,475
I'm a busy little.

37
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,950
Okay, I'm ready!

38
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
1.

39
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,250
2.

40
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
!

41
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,150
- There is nothing happening.
- Something must have overloaded

42
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,575
And taken control!

43
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,350
There has to be another way
turn off the power here.

44
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,050
What's the matter.
You spent a lot of time

45
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:19,875
Working with Varrick
and the Baatar Jr.

46
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,800
Not learned anything
about robots?

47
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:23,575
The only thing I know these vines
,

48
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,050
Is that a lot
mexeres with them explode.

49
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,950
Take the engineers here.
I have an idea.

50
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,400
- Would you tell me?
- I'll mess with these vines

51
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:41,875
- With electricity.
- Let's recap, okay?

52
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,800
Said that this can make the vines
explode.

53
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:48,125
Exactly.
It is the only way to bring down this thing.

54
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,300
- I stand.
- No, I do not Aguentas.

55
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,875
This is not the time to prove it
how amazing you are.

56
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,550
I know how amazing you are.

57
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,800
- You're awesome.
- I do not have time to argue.

58
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,325
I'll do it,
so out of here.

59
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,900
Okay.

60
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:06,175
But for the record,
not approve.

61
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,600
Sai
as soon as you can.

62
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,250
Promise?

63
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,550
I promise.

64
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,450
- I love you.
- Love you too.

65
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,875
Now go!

66
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,150
Over.

67
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,250
You'll call your army
and surrender yourself to the President Raiko.

68
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,750
So you...

69
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,400
Stop!

70
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,150
Kuvira! Give it up!

71
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,850
Never.

72
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,075
Please
stop this madness.

73
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,900
This has to end now!

74
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,950
If you really want to end up with this
,

75
00:09:25,975 --> 00:09:27,425
Then walks catch me!

76
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,950
- It's over now.
- No!

77
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,350
Turn it off!

78
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,550
I can not!

79
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,050
Look.

80
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,400
A new Spiritual Portal.

81
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,450
Spread out and find the Kuvira.

82
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,150
Korra!

83
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,600
Tenzin,
no sign of her.

84
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,725
Keep looking.
Korra!

85
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,950
Korra!

86
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,500
What happened?
We are...

87
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,500
Dead?

88
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,950
No. We're fine.

89
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,800
But we are in the spirit world.

90
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:58,425
All the energy of the gun
created a new portal

91
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,850
And brought us here.

92
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Why do you saved
life?

93
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:04,925
After all
what I did with you.

94
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,650
I think I see a lot of me
in you.

95
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,100
- We're nothing alike.
- Yes we are.

96
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,150
We both are fierce
and determined to succeed,

97
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,200
Sometimes without thinking correctly.

98
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:19,425
That was not what he had planned.

99
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,300
If you had thee surrendered,
none of this would have happened.

100
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,950
Have caused it to yourself.

101
00:13:23,975 --> 00:13:27,275
Stir with vines,
act as a dictator of your people...

102
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,050
You had to know that what
were doing was wrong.

103
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,425
I was trying to help
my people.

104
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,550
Su turned away
to the Earth Kingdom.

105
00:13:34,575 --> 00:13:37,275
You disappeared.
I had to do something.

106
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,900
I think I get it.

107
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,850
I do not understand anything about me
.

108
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,250
I see.

109
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:46,025
Su told me how you hosted
when you were young.

110
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,450
It must be so difficult
be orphaned.

111
00:13:48,475 --> 00:13:50,975
Do not pretend you know
how I felt.

112
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,150
The Avatar is worshiped by millions
!

113
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:55,275
I set aside
by my own parents

114
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,000
Meant nothing to them!

115
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:58,625
How could stay without doing anything

116
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,250
And see the same happen
with my nation

117
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:03,575
When needed someone to command it?

118
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,275
You wanted to create a place
where you and your people

119
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,300
Never feel vulnerable
again.

120
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,550
I may not be an orphan,
but believe me,

121
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:13,975
I understand what is fear.

122
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,950
After being poisoned,

123
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:19,625
Would have done anything to feel in control.

124
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,000
The spirits returned.

125
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,875
And also  Korra.

126
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,150
You all right!

127
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,900
Unleash Kuvira,
or attack.

128
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,250
Step back.

129
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,100
This battle is over.

130
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,250
I owe my life to Avatar.

131
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,450
Her power is beyond anything

132
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:04,275
I can hope to get
.

133
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,850
I will accept any punishment
that the world deems just.

134
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,625
And Su, I am very sorry for all the trouble

135
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,300
I'm
caused to you and your family.

136
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,850
You'll answer for everything you've done.

137
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,400
And although the battle has caused a lot of damage

138
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:37,225
In our beloved city...

139
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,350
Through destruction,
love flourished.

140
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,100
So that's why,
dear friends and family

141
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,050
We gather today to celebrate the wonderful

142
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,250
And sometimes
the inexplicable bond

143
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:51,375
Between Mr. Varrick
and Mrs. Zhu Li!

144
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,025
Hey, mate.
Foca me.

145
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,450
This is my big day!

146
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,200
True love is a fickle creature.

147
00:16:02,225 --> 00:16:03,325
Hard to find,

148
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,350
Almost impossible to tame,

149
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,475
But Varrick
and Zhu Li proven

150
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,650
That even with such huge differences,

151
00:16:09,675 --> 00:16:12,675
There may be circumstances
to be happy together.

152
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,950
Now for the votes!

153
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,450
Thank you, Pabu master.

154
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,350
You, Lord
Iknik Blackstone Varrick,

155
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,675
Of the Southern Water Tribe,
master of the high seas,

156
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:31,150
Accepts Ms. Zhu Li Moon
as his lawful wife?

157
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,950
Promises to treat it not as his assistant,

158
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,025
But as its
honored and beloved partner?

159
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,500
Yes, of course I accepted!

160
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,950
And you, Zhu Li,
accepts Varrick

161
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,200
As your lawfully wedded husband?

162
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:46,975
Promises to take care of him in sickness and in health,

163
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,600
And...
And you rub the calluses

164
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,300
With exfoliating weekly
which is not very...

165
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:53,975
I will not read it all.

166
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,300
I accept Varrick.
With the calluses and everything else.

167
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,100
And now...
Do the thing.

168
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,550
You all right?

169
00:17:16,575 --> 00:17:19,225
You make me so happy,
curse.

170
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,500
My cousin told me
as you kept your cool

171
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:56,925
Throughout the evacuation.

172
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,450
I have to admit, I'm impressed
.

173
00:17:59,475 --> 00:18:01,225
I think you'll be
a great leader,

174
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:04,275
But that does not mean
I'll help you with Korra,

175
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,050
- So not the parts.
- Okay, Mako.

176
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,850
Sometimes good extraction
is the only reward.

177
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,350
It's good to see you, Prince Wu.
Or should I say King Wu?

178
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,450
Are you ready to go back
to Ba Sing Se and take the throne?

179
00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:19,375
Yeah, about that...

180
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,300
I've been thinking lately
to leave the post of King

181
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:24,425
And get rid of the monarchy
completely.

182
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,400
Are you kidding?

183
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,375
For the first time,
I'm not.

184
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,175
Now, I know you will say I'm lazy
,

185
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,100
I'm afraid
have responsibilities

186
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,425
I put my career ahead of
people...

187
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,175
But that's not it.

188
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,100
I really think that the Earth Kingdom

189
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,625
Will be better if the states are independent

190
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,450
And its leaders are elected,
as in the United Republic.

191
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,700
That's really very wise and mature
coming from you.

192
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:49,325
I think it's a great idea.

193
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,300
The Earth Kingdom
must evolve

194
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:54,250
And I will do everything to help you
to make it happen.

195
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,250
I look forward to working with you
,

196
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:58,925
But for now,
the dance floor call me.

197
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,950
- How's your arm?
- Much better.

198
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,250
The word "thank you" is not enough

199
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:09,575
For what you did.

200
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,800
But honestly,
I do not know what else to say.

201
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:13,575
I do not have to say anything.

202
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,950
I want you to know that I will follow you in any battle
,

203
00:19:16,975 --> 00:19:19,025
No matter how crazy things get
.

204
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,300
I went to your building,
and always will be.

205
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,450
I spoke with President Raiko.

206
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,500
Tomorrow, he will announce
the expansion plan of the city

207
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:39,525
Rather than rebuild it.

208
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,850
I bet Aang
never imagined that there could be a Portal

209
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,775
Right in the heart of
Republic City.

210
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,350
Korra, have transformed
over the world in a few years,

211
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,275
Than most of the Avatars
during their lives.

212
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,250
But I feel that just started.

213
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:57,225
There's so much I want to learn
and do.

214
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,350
You do not know how glad

215
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,525
Heard you
so full of hope again.

216
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,050
It has been a journey full of
hurts, does not it?

217
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:08,175
I realized that life is full of sorrow.

218
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,150
I know I sank deeply
after being poisoned,

219
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,700
But finally I understood why, because
had to go through all this.

220
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,350
Needed
understand what it meant to suffer,

221
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,275
So I could have
more compassionate with others.

222
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,750
Even with people
as Kuvira.

223
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,450
Excuse Tenzin.

224
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,350
The Varrick is looking for you.

225
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,800
Something about borrowing a glider fact

226
00:20:36,825 --> 00:20:39,675
- To fly around the tower.
- This does not seem a good idea.

227
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,700
Want to sit with me
for a moment?

228
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:45,075
I'm not ready
to return to the party.

229
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,950
I do not think apologized real
.

230
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,050
- Of what?
- Having gone for so long.

231
00:20:56,675 --> 00:20:58,175
Why not have come back
earlier.

232
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,200
You do not have to forgive you anything.

233
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,650
I'm so glad that
're here now.

234
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,300
I do not know if I could deal
if I lost you and my father

235
00:21:07,325 --> 00:21:08,575
The same day.

236
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,750
I'm sorry for what happened.

237
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,150
Thank you.

238
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,900
I'm glad to have been able
to forgive him.

239
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,000
So, now what?

240
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,750
Returned to the dance floor?

241
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,500
I have no great desire
dancing.

242
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:27,050
Honestly, after all
what happened in recent months

243
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:28,675
I felt like having a vacation.

244
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,150
Let's do it.

245
00:21:31,175 --> 00:21:33,475
Let's enjoy a vacation, just the two
.

246
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,700
Where do you want.

247
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,650
Really?
It's ok.

248
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,850
I always wanted to see how
the spiritual world.

249
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,400
Sounds perfect.

250
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,225
