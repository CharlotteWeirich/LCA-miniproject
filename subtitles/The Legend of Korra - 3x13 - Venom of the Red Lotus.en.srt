1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,735
Earth.

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,737
Fire.

3
00:00:10,229 --> 00:00:11,277
Air.

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,029
Water.

5
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:17,863
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements

6
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:20,209
and bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:25,738
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by</font> <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

8
00:00:26,045 --> 00:00:28,368
The Red Lotus has captured the Avatar.

9
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:30,933
Korra gave herself up in exchange
for the airbenders.

10
00:00:30,972 --> 00:00:32,341
But Zaheer double-crossed her

11
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:34,757
while Ghazan trapped Team Avatar
in the temple.

12
00:00:34,877 --> 00:00:38,480
All seemed lost until Bolin saved
their lives by lavabending.

13
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:40,239
But he's not the only one
with new skills.

14
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:42,882
Zaheer unlocked the ancient
airbending ability of flight.

15
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:46,167
Will Team Avatar save the air nation
and Korra before it's too late?

16
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:49,929
__

17
00:00:55,034 --> 00:00:58,576
When I get out of here,
none of you will survive!

18
00:00:58,577 --> 00:00:59,659
You won't get out.

19
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,033
Unless the metal clan taught
you a way to bend platinum.

20
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:05,075
Once we administer this poison,

21
00:01:05,076 --> 00:01:06,951
your body will naturally react,

22
00:01:06,952 --> 00:01:09,033
forcing you into the Avatar state

23
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:10,993
in an effort to keep you alive.

24
00:01:10,994 --> 00:01:11,910
Sadly for you,

25
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:15,033
you'll be entering it for the last time.

26
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:15,994
No.

27
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:17,534
The Avatar cycle...

28
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,368
Yes.

29
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,159
When we dispatch you in the Avatar state,

30
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,075
the cycle will end.

31
00:01:23,076 --> 00:01:24,034
So we lucky few,

32
00:01:24,035 --> 00:01:26,576
this band of brothers
and sisters in anarchy,

33
00:01:26,577 --> 00:01:29,325
are witnessing the beginning
of an era of true freedom.

34
00:01:29,326 --> 00:01:34,033
Together we will forge a
world without kings and queens,

35
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:35,284
without border or nations,

36
00:01:35,285 --> 00:01:38,743
where a man's only allegiance is to himself

37
00:01:38,744 --> 00:01:40,034
and those he loves.

38
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:41,034
We will return

39
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:44,534
to the true balance of natural order.

40
00:01:44,535 --> 00:01:47,325
And though you will never again be reborn,

41
00:01:47,326 --> 00:01:50,033
your name will echo throughout history.

42
00:01:50,034 --> 00:01:53,702
Korra, the last Avatar.

43
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:05,534
Did you find any way to escape?

44
00:02:05,535 --> 00:02:07,117
No, not yet.

45
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:09,868
But don't worry. We'll find a way out soon.

46
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,033
They might not make it that long.

47
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,951
Korra will come to save us, right?

48
00:02:16,952 --> 00:02:21,660
I think we're going to
have to do this on our own.

49
00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:31,160
Administer the poison.

50
00:02:41,952 --> 00:02:43,868
Ah. Ahh!

51
00:02:56,285 --> 00:02:57,160
Get ready.

52
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:59,868
As soon as she's in the Avatar state,

53
00:02:59,869 --> 00:03:03,034
take her out.

54
00:03:18,034 --> 00:03:18,910
Wait.

55
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:21,784
Why isn't she staying in the Avatar state?

56
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:22,909
Give it time.

57
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,535
She can't resist for long.

58
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:31,159
The place where I saw
them taking the airbenders

59
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,034
is around here.

60
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:36,033
That's gotta be where they took Korra.

61
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:37,034
That's it!

62
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:40,577
Down there, Lefty.

63
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,743
Find the airbenders

64
00:03:49,744 --> 00:03:51,200
and my family.

65
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:52,076
Don't worry.

66
00:03:52,077 --> 00:03:54,242
I'm not coming out without our children

67
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:56,869
and the rest of your people.

68
00:04:08,577 --> 00:04:12,201
It's working.

69
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:20,659
I told you, Korra.

70
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:27,034
The world doesn't need you anymore.

71
00:04:27,285 --> 00:04:31,325
The time of the Avatar is over, Korra.

72
00:04:31,326 --> 00:04:34,952
Give up.

73
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:39,033
You're too weak to resist

74
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:42,033
and I'm stronger than ever.

75
00:04:42,034 --> 00:04:44,909
There's no use fighting.

76
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,617
Let go.

77
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:48,784
Let go.

78
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:50,868
Let go.

79
00:04:50,869 --> 00:04:53,326
Let go.

80
00:04:58,034 --> 00:04:59,617
I'm thirsty.

81
00:04:59,618 --> 00:05:01,033
I gotta go pee.

82
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:01,869
Me too.

83
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,826
Hey. Keep it down over there

84
00:05:03,827 --> 00:05:06,075
or you're all going to end up like them.

85
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:08,909
Sir, please. Could we just have some water?

86
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,034
There are children and a baby here.

87
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:22,826
Ah!

88
00:05:24,952 --> 00:05:28,534
Oh, so you just called
me over to attack me.

89
00:05:28,535 --> 00:05:32,033
Fine. Now nobody gets any water.

90
00:05:32,034 --> 00:05:33,034
Ah.

91
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:35,033
I don't know how we
ended up here in day care

92
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,743
while everyone else gets to watch

93
00:05:36,744 --> 00:05:38,701
the Avatar being destroyed.

94
00:05:38,702 --> 00:05:41,284
I can hold a bowl of poison.

95
00:05:43,618 --> 00:05:44,243
Hey!

96
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,033
What do you think you're doing?

97
00:05:57,034 --> 00:05:59,660
Ah!

98
00:06:02,034 --> 00:06:02,869
Mom!

99
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,033
Oh, honey, I'm so glad you're safe.

100
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:07,325
Oh! Me too.

101
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:17,868
You're alive. I can't believe it.

102
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:18,535
Why?

103
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:20,056
Just because I was blown out of the sky

104
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,034
and fell hundreds of feet down a cliff?

105
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:27,951
Don't you know it takes more
than that to get rid of me?

106
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:30,033
We have to get these two out of here now.

107
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:31,159
They don't look so good.

108
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,409
What are you talking about?

109
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,868
I feel great.

110
00:06:37,869 --> 00:06:39,534
You guys get everyone out of here.

111
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:40,576
I'll search for Korra.

112
00:06:40,577 --> 00:06:41,577
We're going with you.

113
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:43,951
You don't have to search for her.

114
00:06:43,952 --> 00:06:47,659
I know exactly where she's being held.

115
00:06:58,744 --> 00:06:59,452
Now!

116
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:04,033
Destroy the Avatar.

117
00:07:10,368 --> 00:07:15,035
Ugh.

118
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:47,242
Ah!

119
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:48,212
Korra.

120
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,908
We have to help her!

121
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:00,533
Look out!

122
00:08:00,534 --> 00:08:03,038
You help Korra. We got this.

123
00:08:40,951 --> 00:08:43,574
Daddy!

124
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:46,532
Oh, thank goodness you're all right.

125
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:49,658
Honey, are you okay?

126
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:53,533
I'll be fine.

127
00:08:57,368 --> 00:09:00,243
We have to help Korra.

128
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:22,451
Ah!

129
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:26,408
What are you smiling about?

130
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:31,367
I was just remembering
the last time we fought.

131
00:09:31,368 --> 00:09:37,076
Well, a lot has changed since then.

132
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:40,367
So that's how you got out of the temple.

133
00:09:40,368 --> 00:09:40,909
Not bad.

134
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,783
Let's see what you've got.

135
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:27,617
You can't fight me and the poison.

136
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:30,408
I can fly up on my bison to help her.

137
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:32,532
You'd never be able to keep up with Zaheer.

138
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:33,658
He's too powerful.

139
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,532
We have to do something.

140
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:36,908
How can he fly like that?

141
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:39,158
He's unlocked powers of airbending

142
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:42,075
that haven't existed
for thousands of years.

143
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,532
There haven't been this many airbenders

144
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:47,532
in one place for a long time, either.

145
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:50,116
We have power together.

146
00:11:50,117 --> 00:11:52,325
Hurry! Everyone form a circle.

147
00:11:52,326 --> 00:11:55,117
Follow me.

148
00:12:17,742 --> 00:12:18,659
Ah!

149
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,908
You have no water.

150
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,325
It's over.

151
00:12:25,326 --> 00:12:27,533
Not yet.

152
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:41,909
Now it's over!

153
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:09,533
Ah!

154
00:13:26,326 --> 00:13:27,950
Give up, Ghazan!

155
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:28,867
You can't win!

156
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:31,450
I'm never going back to prison.

157
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:33,158
If I'm going down today,

158
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:36,451
you're coming with me.

159
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:47,076
Mako, hang on.

160
00:13:58,368 --> 00:13:59,991
Ah!

161
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:04,867
Ah!

162
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:26,866
The poison has done its work.

163
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:32,243
The Avatar cycle will be over momentarily.

164
00:15:23,493 --> 00:15:27,409
Ah!

165
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:02,659
Ah.

166
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:17,367
Korra, sweetheart,

167
00:16:17,368 --> 00:16:20,532
it's me, dad.

168
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:24,034
Please hang on.

169
00:16:35,201 --> 00:16:37,200
What are you laughing about?

170
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:38,242
You're too late!

171
00:16:38,243 --> 00:16:41,532
The poison's been in her system too long.

172
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,532
The Red Lotus has won.

173
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:45,866
You can save her.

174
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:49,368
The poison is metallic.

175
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:32,075
Dad?

176
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:33,532
You're alive.

177
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:34,616
I'm here for you.

178
00:17:34,617 --> 00:17:37,658
I'm never going to let you go.

179
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:38,741
No!

180
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:39,533
No!

181
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:40,783
You don't understand.

182
00:17:40,784 --> 00:17:43,532
The revolution has already begun.

183
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:46,616
Chaos is the natural order of

184
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:48,658
You see what I did there?

185
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:50,200
I put a sock in it.

186
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:51,492
Literally.

187
00:17:51,493 --> 00:17:53,075
Classic Bolin.

188
00:17:53,076 --> 00:17:56,243
I do what I do.

189
00:18:06,428 --> 00:18:07,428
There you go.

190
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:10,928
All fixed up for a
formal Avatar appearance.

191
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:14,011
Take a look.

192
00:18:14,012 --> 00:18:16,178
It's great.

193
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:17,138
Thanks.

194
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:21,636
You know, nobody expects you
to bounce back right away.

195
00:18:21,637 --> 00:18:23,427
It's only been two weeks.

196
00:18:23,428 --> 00:18:26,138
You need time to heal.

197
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:31,303
I want you to know that I'm here for you.

198
00:18:31,304 --> 00:18:34,303
If you ever want to talk, or anything.

199
00:18:34,304 --> 00:18:37,803
But let's just try to enjoy this today.

200
00:18:37,804 --> 00:18:40,178
For Jinora.

201
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:42,427
You're right.

202
00:18:42,428 --> 00:18:43,428
Okay.

203
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:47,221
Let's go.

204
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:06,427
You look beautiful, sweetie.

205
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:08,553
You're looking stronger every day, Korra.

206
00:19:08,554 --> 00:19:11,719
I'd like to officially welcome
you back to Republic City.

207
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,095
I know that the last time we saw each other

208
00:19:14,096 --> 00:19:16,178
it didn't end on the best terms,

209
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:17,699
but I want to thank you for taking down

210
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:22,137
those Red Lotus terrorists.

211
00:19:22,138 --> 00:19:23,511
We should go inside.

212
00:19:23,512 --> 00:19:26,428
I can help. I wanna ride with Korra.

213
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:27,970
Jinora's already inside.

214
00:19:27,971 --> 00:19:29,845
It smells like shoe trees.

215
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:32,803
Sandalwood, Meelo.

216
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:36,427
I got this.

217
00:19:36,428 --> 00:19:39,804
Hang in there, kid.

218
00:19:43,971 --> 00:19:45,220
She's not looking good.

219
00:19:45,221 --> 00:19:48,303
Neither would you if you'd
gone through what she had.

220
00:19:48,304 --> 00:19:49,719
She'll be fine.

221
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,886
She just needs time to heal.

222
00:19:51,887 --> 00:19:54,262
The poison took a great toll.

223
00:19:54,263 --> 00:19:55,012
Of course.

224
00:19:55,013 --> 00:19:56,533
I'm just saying, with the earth kingdom

225
00:19:56,557 --> 00:20:00,053
in complete disarray
since the loss of the queen

226
00:20:00,054 --> 00:20:01,494
and even with Zaheer locked up again,

227
00:20:01,518 --> 00:20:04,427
we still don't know how
many Red Lotus members

228
00:20:04,428 --> 00:20:06,803
might be out there, hiding.

229
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:07,679
Exactly.

230
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,520
With the world getting
more and more dangerous,

231
00:20:09,544 --> 00:20:12,427
we need the Avatar now more than ever.

232
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:18,428
Who will protect us while
she's in a wheelchair?

233
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:23,428
Jinora, come forward.

234
00:20:27,012 --> 00:20:29,886
Today we welcome the
first airbending master

235
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:30,762
in a generation,

236
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:34,428
and I couldn't be more
proud of my daughter.

237
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:37,178
When the existence of
our people was threatened,

238
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:40,427
when the Avatar's life hung in the balance,

239
00:20:40,428 --> 00:20:42,053
Jinora never gave up hope.

240
00:20:42,054 --> 00:20:45,845
Thanks to her leadership,
I see a very bright future

241
00:20:45,846 --> 00:20:46,886
for the air nation.

242
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:51,011
Of course, there would be no
air nation without Avatar Korra.

243
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:52,053
She opened the portals

244
00:20:52,054 --> 00:20:55,636
and somehow the world began anew for us.

245
00:20:55,637 --> 00:20:58,427
And she was even willing
to lay down her own life

246
00:20:58,428 --> 00:20:59,719
in order to protect ours.

247
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,178
There's no way we can ever
repay her for all she's done.

248
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:09,095
But we can follow her example
of service and sacrifice.

249
00:21:09,096 --> 00:21:10,553
So while she recuperates,

250
00:21:10,554 --> 00:21:13,928
the air nation will
reclaim its nomadic roots

251
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:15,761
and roam the earth.

252
00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:17,303
But unlike our ancestors,

253
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:19,719
we will serve people of all nations,

254
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,427
working wherever there
is corruption and discord,

255
00:21:23,428 --> 00:21:27,427
to restore balance and peace.

256
00:21:27,428 --> 00:21:29,053
Avatar Korra,

257
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,886
I vow that we will do
everything in our power

258
00:21:31,887 --> 00:21:33,345
to follow in your footsteps

259
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:37,846
and bring harmony to the world.

260
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:41,427
Now, let us anoint the master

261
00:21:41,428 --> 00:21:45,678
who will help lead us in our new path.

262
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:17,954
