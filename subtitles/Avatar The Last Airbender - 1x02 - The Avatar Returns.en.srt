1
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:05,580
Yay! Aang's back!

2
00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:16,993
I knew it! You signaled the Fire Navy with that flare!

3
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,988
You're leading them straight to us, aren't you?

4
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:21,910
Aang didn't do anything. It was an accident.

5
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:26,066
Yeh, we were on the ship and there was this booby trap and well...

6
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:28,043
...we... we boobied... right into it.

7
00:01:28,044 --> 00:01:33,367
Katara, you shouldn't have gone on that ship. Now we could all be in danger!

8
00:01:33,368 --> 00:01:37,476
Don't blame Katara! I brought her there. It's my fault.

9
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:41,967
Aha! The traitor confesses! Warriors, away from the enemy!

10
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,831
The foreigner is banned from our village!

11
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:46,934
Sokka, you're making a mistake.

12
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:51,396
No! I'm keeping my promise to Dad. I'm protecting you from threats like him!

13
00:01:51,397 --> 00:01:55,384
Aang is not our enemy! Don't you see?

14
00:01:55,385 --> 00:01:59,713
Aang's brought us something we haven't had in a long time. Fun.

15
00:01:59,714 --> 00:02:03,001
Fun? We can't fight firebenders with fun!

16
00:02:03,002 --> 00:02:04,910
You should try it sometime.

17
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:07,102
Get out of our village. Now!

18
00:02:07,103 --> 00:02:10,505
Grandmother, please, don't let Sokka do this.

19
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:13,038
Katara, you knew going on that ship was forbidden.

20
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,341
Sokka is right. I think it best if the airbender leaves.

21
00:02:17,342 --> 00:02:20,300
Fine! Then I'm banished too!

22
00:02:20,301 --> 00:02:22,344
C'mon, Aang, let's go!

23
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,676
Where do you think you're going?

24
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:29,158
To find a waterbender! Aang is taking me to the North Pole!

25
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,113
I am? Great!

26
00:02:31,114 --> 00:02:38,012
Katara! Would you really choose him over your tribe? Your own family?

27
00:02:42,522 --> 00:02:47,873
Katara, I don't want to come between you and your family.

28
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:52,942
So, you're leaving the South Pole? This is goodbye?

29
00:02:52,943 --> 00:02:55,080
Thanks for penguin sledding with me.

30
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:56,293
Where will you go?

31
00:02:56,294 --> 00:02:59,874
Guess I'll go back home and look for the airbenders.

32
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:06,683
Wow, I haven't cleaned my room in a hundred years. Not looking forward to that.

33
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:10,707
It was nice meeting everyone.

34
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:14,038
Let's see your bison fly now, air boy.

35
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:18,158
Come on, Appa, you can do it! Yip! Yip!

36
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,484
Yeh, I thought so.

37
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,557
Aang! Don't go! We'll miss you!

38
00:03:27,558 --> 00:03:30,455
I'll miss you too.

39
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:36,959
Come on, boy.

40
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:47,679
Katara, you'll feel better after you...

41
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,633
You happy now? There goes my one chance of becoming a waterbender!

42
00:03:57,806 --> 00:03:59,499
All right! Ready our defenses!

43
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,101
The Fire Nation could be on our shores any moment now!

44
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:02,749
But, I gotta...

45
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,978
And no potty breaks!

46
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:20,716
Yeh, I liked her too.

47
00:04:27,336 --> 00:04:29,630
The village!

48
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,023
Appa, wait here!

49
00:05:41,836 --> 00:05:44,909
Oh man!

50
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,810
Ohhh, man!

51
00:06:13,645 --> 00:06:17,088
Sokka, get out of the way!

52
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:31,484
Where are you hiding him?

53
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,694
He'd be about this age? Master of all elements?

54
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:53,552
I know you're hiding him!

55
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:08,239
Show no fear!

56
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:55,723
Hey Katara. Hey Sokka.

57
00:08:55,724 --> 00:08:59,762
Hi... Aang. Thanks for comin'.

58
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:14,769
Looking for me?

59
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:20,040
You're the airbender? You're the Avatar?

60
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,126
Aang?

61
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,835
No way.

62
00:09:24,154 --> 00:09:27,286
I've spent years preparing for this encounter.

63
00:09:27,287 --> 00:09:31,671
Training. Meditating. You're just a child!

64
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:34,964
Well, you're just a teenager.

65
00:09:48,098 --> 00:09:52,425
If I go with you, will you promise to leave everyone alone?

66
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:04,073
No, Aang! Don't do this!

67
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:08,142
Don't worry, Katara, it'll be okay.

68
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:14,303
Take care of Appa for me until I get back.

69
00:10:14,304 --> 00:10:19,096
Head a course to the Fire Nation. I'm going home.

70
00:10:52,595 --> 00:10:54,805
We have to go after that ship, Sokka.

71
00:10:54,806 --> 00:10:57,533
Aang saved our tribe, now we have to save him.

72
00:10:57,534 --> 00:10:58,472
Katara, I...

73
00:10:58,473 --> 00:11:03,254
Why can't you realize that he's on our side? If we don't help him, no one will.

74
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,157
I know you don't like Aang, but we owe him and I...

75
00:11:05,158 --> 00:11:10,422
Katara! Are you gonna talk all day or are you comin' with me?

76
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:12,660
Sokka!

77
00:11:13,661 --> 00:11:15,650
Get in. We're going to save your boyfriend.

78
00:11:15,651 --> 00:11:16,243
He's not my...

79
00:11:16,244 --> 00:11:17,588
Whatever.

80
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:20,987
What do you two think you're doing?

81
00:11:21,796 --> 00:11:27,491
You'll need these. You have a long journey ahead of you.

82
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:31,992
It's been so long since I've had hope.

83
00:11:31,993 --> 00:11:36,901
But you brought it back to life, my little waterbender.

84
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:42,550
And you, my brave warrior, be nice to your sister.

85
00:11:42,551 --> 00:11:45,381
Yeah... okay, Gran.

86
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,749
Aang is the Avatar. He's the world's only chance.

87
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:57,422
You both found him for a reason. Now your destinies are intertwined with his.

88
00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:02,905
There's no way we're gonna catch a war ship with a canoe.

89
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:06,653
Appa!

90
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:11,249
You just love taking me out of my comfort zone, don't ya?

91
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:18,822
This staff will make an excellent gift for my father.

92
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:23,602
I suppose you wouldn't know of fathers, being raised by monks.

93
00:12:23,603 --> 00:12:28,966
Take the Avatar to the prison hold. And take this to my quarters.

94
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:34,037
Hey, you mind taking this to his quarters for me?

95
00:12:47,523 --> 00:12:51,163
So... I guess you never fought an airbender before.

96
00:12:51,164 --> 00:12:54,495
I bet I can take you both with my hands tied behind my back.

97
00:12:54,496 --> 00:12:56,681
Silence!

98
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:18,153
The Avatar has escaped!

99
00:13:23,284 --> 00:13:28,389
Go. Fly. Soar.

100
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,710
Please, Appa, we need your help. Aang needs your help.

101
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:36,617
Up. Ascend. Elevate.

102
00:13:36,618 --> 00:13:40,302
Sokka doesn't believe you can fly, but I do, Appa.

103
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:43,926
Come on. Don't you wanna save Aang?

104
00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:53,925
What was it that kid said? Yee-ha? Hup hup? Wahoo? Uh... yip yip?

105
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,557
You did it, Sokka!

106
00:14:04,558 --> 00:14:09,336
He's flying! He's flying! Katara, he's...!

107
00:14:09,988 --> 00:14:13,951
I mean, big deal, he's flying.

108
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:26,151
You haven't seen my staff around, have you?

109
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:32,790
Thanks anyway!

110
00:14:56,966 --> 00:14:58,649
Sorry...

111
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:07,345
My staff!

112
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:11,375
Looks like I underestimated you.

113
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,372
What is that?

114
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:52,526
Appa!

115
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:15,385
Aang! No!

116
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:21,373
Aang! Aang! Aang...!!

117
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,800
Did you see what he just did?

118
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:52,840
Now that was some waterbending!

119
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:03,552
Aang! Are you okay?

120
00:18:04,356 --> 00:18:08,616
Hey Katara. Hey Sokka. Thanks for coming.

121
00:18:08,617 --> 00:18:11,141
Well, I couldn't let you have all the glory.

122
00:18:11,142 --> 00:18:12,433
I dropped my staff.

123
00:18:12,434 --> 00:18:14,500
Got it!

124
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:28,957
Ha! That's from the Water Tribe!

125
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:39,757
Katara!

126
00:18:50,406 --> 00:18:51,670
Hurry up, Sokka!

127
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:57,970
I'm just a guy with a boomerang, I didn't ask for all this flying and magic.

128
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,821
Yip yip! Yip yip!

129
00:19:11,394 --> 00:19:14,328
Shoot them down!

130
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:45,099
Good news for the Fire Lord. The Fire Nation's greatest threat is just a little kid.

131
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,765
That kid, Uncle, just did this. I won't underestimate him again.

132
00:19:50,766 --> 00:19:54,422
Dig this ship out and follow them!

133
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,024
As soon as you're done with that.

134
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:09,865
How did you do that? With the water? It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

135
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:13,717
I don't know. I just sort of... did it.

136
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:17,129
Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?

137
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,950
Because... I never wanted to be.

138
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:33,910
But Aang, the world's been waiting for the Avatar to return...

139
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:36,165
...and finally put an end to this war.

140
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,325
And how am I going to do that?

141
00:20:38,326 --> 00:20:43,570
According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth, then fire, right?

142
00:20:43,571 --> 00:20:45,374
That's what the monks told me.

143
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:49,384
Well, if we go to the North Pole you can master waterbending.

144
00:20:49,385 --> 00:20:51,160
We can learn it together!

145
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:55,086
And Sokka, I'm sure you'll get to knock some firebender heads on the way.

146
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,430
I'd like that. I'd really like that.

147
00:20:58,431 --> 00:21:00,250
Then we're in this together.

148
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:02,339
All right, but before I learn waterbending...

149
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,528
...we have some serious business to attend to here, here, and here.

150
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:09,156
What's there?

151
00:21:09,157 --> 00:21:11,187
Here we'll ride the hopping llamas.

152
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:14,801
Then waaaay over here we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish.

153
00:21:14,802 --> 00:21:17,551
Then back over here we'll ride the hog-monkeys.

154
00:21:17,552 --> 00:21:21,741
They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun!

155
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:24,341
