Whatever happens, whatever accidents
or tragedies may occur...

6
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:29,404
above all else,
you must return with that egg!

7
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:30,487
I understand.

8
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,742
Humans weren't born with magic.

9
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,785
We were born with nothing.

10
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,621
But we still found a way
to do amazing things.

11
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,332
That's what dark magic
is really all about.

12
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,004
I'm sorry. It's just not for me.

13
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,224
Why should I trust you?

14
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,982
Hey, what was that? A shadow?

15
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,943
There's something up there.

He said it was a key, but a key to what?

22
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:19,389
You practicing magic or are you losing
to Bait at a game of rolly-cubes?

23
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:21,724
Magic.

24
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,268
I think I'm getting close.

25
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,146
There's so much swirling around
in my head,

26
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,356
but I need a way to bring it all together.

27
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,359
- Like some kind of breakthrough?
- Yeah.

28
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,152
[Bait snorts]

29
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,906
What about you? You were born
with the Moon Arcanum.

30
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,242
Uh, I suppose so?

31
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:43,538
So when you do cool moon powers,
you're connecting to the moon, right?

32
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,664
What does that feel like?

33
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,584
Uh, I don't really think about it.

34
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,295
I just stand in the light
of the full moon,

35
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,738
and then there's a feeling like...

[mimics whooshing]

37
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,800
And then there's a sort of... ting!

38
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,303
And then...
[exclaims] Moonshadow powers!

[voice echoing]

40
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,222
Does that help?

41
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,100
No, not at all. But I enjoyed it.

42
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,523
Once we're in town, we can ditch Corvus
in jail or something

43
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,691
and be done with him.

44
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,778
We're so far off
Callum and Ezran's trail now.

45
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,422
Do you think we can catch up with them?

46
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,908
Of course we can! We promised Dad.

47
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:23,661
You know, I could help you track them,
if you untied me.

48
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,374
[laughing] No, no, no, no.

49
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,586
If I untie you,
you're just gonna try and escape.

50
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,921
Again.

51
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,839
No, not this time.

52
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,508
This time will be different. I promise.

53
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,387
- Huh.
- Pfft, no!

54
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,264
Hey, hey!

55
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,517
Fool me once, shame on you.

56
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,103
Fool me twice, shame on me.

57
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,690
Fool me three times, back to you again.

58
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,026
That's not how it goes.

59
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,363
Shame on you.

I have to be a mage again.

00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,251
We saw a dragon in the clouds yesterday.

63
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,795
Things will only get tougher
once we get into Xadia.

64
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,048
And crossing the border?
That's going to be crazy dangerous.

65
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,550
Eh, well...

66
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,719
maybe not.

67
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,055
There's a river of lava!

68
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,808
One does not simply walk into Xadia.

69
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,479
Actually, one does simply walk into Xadia.

70
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:35,024
There's a secret path, the Moonstone Path.

71
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:39,237
It'll be safe and easy, even for you,
magic or no magic.

72
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,656
Come get some rest.

73
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,867

We're looking for a town jail?

00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,104
We've got a horrible traitor to lock up

79

Standard traitor stuff.

Oh, something's weird.

83
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,745
I know! No one's listening to me.

84
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,997
What?

85
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,167
There! It's back.

[soldier] Yeah, it's the third night
in a row it's flown over us.

90
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,070
And you haven't shot it down yet?

91
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,072
What are those ballistas for?

92
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,365
Well, it hasn't attacked us.

93
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,787
So? It's the enemy.
I'm taking command here.

94
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,663
Crownguard, I might have mentioned.

95
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,465
Hold on! The dragon isn't attacking.

96
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,383
It's just trying to intimidate us.

97
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,052
[scoffs] Well, then,

98
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:29,138
I'll just have to show it
that humans won't be intimidated.

What's it doing here?

115
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,976
Why is it attacking that town?

116
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,270
Uh, I don't know.

Don't just stand there!
Get on those ballistas!

119
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,948
It's circling back. Get ready to fire.

120
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,538
Fire!

121
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,230

What are you... [yells]

123
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,237
I don't understand.

124
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,115
These people need help.
Get as many as you can to safety.

125
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,413
Don't get yourself killed.

126
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,924
I think I really messed up
this time, Clauds.

127
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,718
I... I don't know how to stop it.

128
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,179
Don't say that yet. I have an idea.

129
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,431
It's the eye of a gryphon.

130
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:22,603
With this, I can enchant a ballista bolt
to never miss its target, no matter what.

131
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,187
Ugh!

132
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,567
So you just carry a gryphon eyeball
around with you?

133
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,484
Who does that?

134
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,071
Oh, how about, "Thank you for carrying
a gryphon's eye with you, Claudia.

135
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,865
You're so prepared. You're the best."

136
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,996
Thank you, Claudia.

How dare you?

152
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,046
You used King Harrow's seal
to summon the Pentarchy

153
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,006
and then you lied to them.

154
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,801
You called yourself the Regent of Katolis.

155
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,887
You committed treason, Viren,
and for what?

156
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,641
[sighs] For nothing.

157
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,562
You'll be removed
from the Council for this,

00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,772
and you'll be lucky if that's all.

[horse neighing]

168
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:53,939
What are you doing?

169
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,901
The humans are coming.
We have to protect her.

170
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,402
We can't fight them, Rayla.

171
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,904
I can't just leave her.

172
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,656
Callum's right.
And we have to get back to Zym.

173
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,366
We did what we could.

174
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,369
Come on.

175
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:27,056
I always thought it'd be you
who took down a dragon, not me.

176
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:27,973
Huh?

177
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,893
I mean, wasn't this
one of your life goals?

178
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,811
Slaying a dragon? [chuckles]

179
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,021
Yes.

180
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,775
Huh. It's funny,
because I don't really care about it.

181
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,027
But... [chuckles]

182
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:45,199
I think it's dead,
but we can't be too sure.

183
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,368
Secure the dragon!

184
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,793
Zym! Zym, are you okay?

185
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,837
[whimpering]

186
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,632

[Zym whimpering]

188
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,346
I should have done something.

189
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,265
Rayla, you're always the one

190
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:13,394
who reminds us that the only thing
that matters is getting Zym back to Xadia.

191
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,104
Why are you hesitating now?

192
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,482
I'm not hesitating. This is different.

193
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,069
Every fiber in my body
is telling me this is wrong.

194
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,906
That dragon is defenseless
and I just left her there.

195
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,336
Welcome back!
I hope you had a pleasant trip.

196
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,426
How can you possibly remain so cheerful
in your dire circumstances?

197
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,178
Well, I think about it like this,

198
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:53,767
why see myself as chained down,
when I can be chained up?

199
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,851
[metal clanging]

200
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,646
I admire your tenacity.

201
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,954
[breathes deeply]

202
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,290
I have nothing left to lose.

203
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,926
[Claudia] There's so many things
we can do with a dragon.

204
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,930
There's even a chapter about spells
that use dragon snot.

205
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,057
It's some powerful goo.

206
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,226
We don't have the Dragon Prince,

207
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,855
but do you think if we brought this dragon
home, Dad would...

208
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,190
It's something, but...

209
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,944
it does weigh, I don't know,
about a million tons?

210
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,445
How are we gonna move it?

211
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,614
In pieces.

212
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,510
[Callum] I don't get it, Rayla.

213
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,996
Why are you so worried about a dragon
that just set fire to a town?

214
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,542
I've been thinking about something
someone once told me.

215
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:04,838
About how when one person hurts another,
then that person hurts them back,

216
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,383
it becomes a cycle that never ends.

217
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,968
Who told you that?

218
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,720
- You did.
- Oh.

219
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,472
But, Callum, to break that cycle,

220
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,016
someone has to take a stand
when no one else will.

221
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,104
You're right.
If we're really going to change things,

222
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:23,190
we can't just watch while humans and Xadia
keep hurting each other.

223
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,859
But how do I take a stand?

224
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,195
Believe me, I want to go
down there with you,

225
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,281
and be the heroes who stop
all the fighting and save the day,

226
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,533
but I can't do that.

227
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,118
I can't do anything!

228
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,247
It's okay, Callum.
I'm not asking you to come with me.

229
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,333
Protecting that dragon doesn't just feel
like the right thing to do,

230
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,460
it feels like the right thing
for me to do.

231
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,421
It's where I'm meant to be.

232
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,633
I'm going back down there.

233
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,346
If I don't come back,
you and Ezran can get Zym to Xadia.

234
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,639
I believe in you.

235
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,474
Wait, Rayla!

236
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,362
[breathes deeply]

237
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,700
It doesn't matter what happens to me.

238
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,786
Live or die, this dragon goes home.

239
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,566
Ugh, this guy again. Of course.

240
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,986
A dead dragon and a dead elf
all in one day.

241
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,197
Everything's coming up Soren.

What are you doing?

248
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,307
I'm just drawing, Ezran.

249
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,390
You seem upset.

250
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,310
Yep. I draw when I'm upset.

251
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
Argh!

252
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,829
Maybe there is something I can do.

253
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:46,333
Ezran, you have to stay here.
Protect Bait and Zym.

254
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,253
- [Zym exclaims]
- Hey!

255
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,756
- [Zym whimpers]
- Don't worry, Zym.

256
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,800
We're gonna have fun while they're gone.

257
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,594
Why don't we play a game?

258
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,054
[squawks]

[groans faintly]

261
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,819
[Soren] Ooh, yeah. The thing about chains?

262
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,988
They're made of metal. Hard to cut.

263
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,614
[panting]

264
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,411
I'm not backing down.

265
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,873
Try not to kill her, Soren.

266
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,833
She can lead us to Ezran and Callum.

267
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,126
[Callum] She doesn't have to.

268
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,421
I'm right here.

269
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,674
[exclaims] Callum! You're safe!

270
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,097
What are you doing?

271
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,725
Your kind of magic.

272
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,644
You don't want to do this, Callum.

273
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,272
It's really dangerous
unless someone shows you how.

274
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:51,940
You already did.

Get up. You're free.

[Soren] Congratulations!

281
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,684
That was impressive. Really.

282
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,771
You did everything you could
to save a monster

283
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,273
that torched a town of innocent people.

284
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:37,152
But it didn't even matter.
You freed a dead dragon.

Now, where's Zym?

Oh, no. I'm so stupid.

Come on, get up.
We have to get you some help.

I... I can't move, Claudia.

I can't move!

Ah...

How may I serve you?
