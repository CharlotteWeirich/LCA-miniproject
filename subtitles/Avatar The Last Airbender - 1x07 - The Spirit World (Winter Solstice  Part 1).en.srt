00:00:09,562 --> 00:00:13,696
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,697 --> 00:00:17,775
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:22,088
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:25,248
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:29,410
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:31,250
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:33,456
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,457 --> 00:00:37,189
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,812
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

Book One: Water | Chapter Seven:
The Spirit World (Winter Solstice, Part 1)

15
00:01:06,077 --> 00:01:08,542
Those clouds look so soft, don't they?

16
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:13,054
Like you could just jump down and you'd land in a big, soft cottony heap.

17
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:14,731
Maybe you should give it a try.

18
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,194
You're hilarious.

19
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,152
I'll try it!

20
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:23,237
Yehhhh!

21
00:01:27,923 --> 00:01:31,835
Turns out clouds are made of water!

22
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:39,033
Hey, what is that?

23
00:01:41,307 --> 00:01:44,807
It's like a scar.

24
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:52,795
Listen, it's so quiet. There's no life anywhere.

25
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:55,629
Aang, are you okay?

26
00:01:55,756 --> 00:01:59,690
Fire Nation! Those evil savages make me sick! They have no respect for...

27
00:01:59,784 --> 00:02:00,829
Shh!

28
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,137
What? I'm not allowed to be angry?

29
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:11,888
Why would anyone do this? How could I let this happen?

30
00:02:11,983 --> 00:02:16,082
Aang, you didn't let this happen. It has nothing to do with you.

31
00:02:16,193 --> 00:02:22,030
Yes it does. It's the Avatar's job to protect nature. But, I don't know how to do my job.

32
00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:25,705
That's why we're going to the North Pole to find you a teacher.

33
00:02:25,807 --> 00:02:27,834
Yeh, a waterbending teacher,...

34
00:02:27,946 --> 00:02:30,661
...but there's no one who can teach me how to be the Avatar.

35
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:33,615
Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me.

36
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:35,472
The Avatar before you?

37
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:39,147
He died over a hundred years ago, how are you supposed to talk to him?

38
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:42,146
I don't know.

39
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:50,227
Uncle! It's time to leave! Where are you? Uncle Iroh!

40
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:51,731
Over here.

41
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,936
Uncle?

42
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,723
We need to move on, we're closing in on the Avatar's trail and I don't want to lose him!

43
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:01,239
You look tired, Prince Zuko.

44
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:07,394
Why don't you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles.

45
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:11,217
My troubles cannot be soaked away. It's time to go!

46
00:03:11,354 --> 00:03:16,078
You should take your teacher's advice and relax a little.

47
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:24,551
The temperature's just right. I heated it myself.

48
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:28,131
Enough! We need to leave now! Get out of the water!

49
00:03:28,278 --> 00:03:29,545
Very well.

50
00:03:29,655 --> 00:03:32,655
On second thought, why don't you take another few minutes,...

51
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:36,270
...but be back at the ship in half an hour or I'm leaving without you.

52
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:42,669
Hey Aang, are you ready to be cheered up?

53
00:03:42,778 --> 00:03:44,522
No.

54
00:03:46,096 --> 00:03:48,429
Hey, how was that cheering me up?

55
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:50,425
Cheered me up.

56
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:54,605
Ow! Yeh, I probably deserved that.

57
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:59,886
These acorns are everywhere, Aang. That means the forest will grow back.

58
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:02,481
Every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday,...

59
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:07,695
...and all the birds and animals that lived here will come back.

60
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,362
Thanks, Katara.

61
00:04:12,757 --> 00:04:14,828
Hey, who are you?

62
00:04:14,944 --> 00:04:19,110
When I saw the flying bison, I thought it was impossible,...

63
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:25,958
...but those markings... are you the Avatar child?

64
00:04:26,743 --> 00:04:30,938
My village desperately needs your help.

65
00:04:43,231 --> 00:04:46,925
This young person is the Avatar.

66
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:50,154
So the rumors of your return are true.

67
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:53,966
It is the greatest honor of a lifetime to be in your presence.

68
00:04:54,082 --> 00:04:56,570
Nice to meet you too.

69
00:04:57,224 --> 00:05:00,390
So... is there something I can help you with?

70
00:05:00,513 --> 00:05:02,467
I'm not sure...

71
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,754
Our village is in crisis, he's our only hope.

72
00:05:06,863 --> 00:05:13,085
For the last few days at sunset a spirit monster comes and attacks our village.

73
00:05:13,207 --> 00:05:17,305
He is Hei-Bai, the black and white spirit.

74
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:19,086
Why is it attacking you?

75
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,423
We do not know, but each of the last three nights he has abducted one of our own.

76
00:05:24,553 --> 00:05:28,263
We are especially fearful because the winter solstice draws near.

77
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:29,744
What happens then?

78
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,331
As the solstice approaches, the natural world and the spirit world...

79
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:40,678
...grow closer and closer until the line between them is blurred completely.

80
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:44,144
Hei-Bai is already causing devastation and destruction.

81
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:48,424
Once the solstice is here there is no telling what will happen.

82
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,321
So, what do you want me to do exactly?

83
00:05:51,443 --> 00:05:55,903
Who better to resolve a crisis between our world and the spirit world...

84
00:05:56,015 --> 00:06:02,530
...than the Avatar himself? You are the great bridge between man and spirits.

85
00:06:02,656 --> 00:06:04,898
Right... that's me.

86
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,263
Hey, great bridge guy', can I talk to you over here for a second?

87
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:13,349
Aang, you seem a little unsure about all this.

88
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,712
Yeh, that might be because I don't know anything at all about the spirit world.

89
00:06:18,853 --> 00:06:21,530
It's not like there's someone to teach me this stuff!

90
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:23,824
So, can you help these people?

91
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:31,176
I have to try, don't I? Maybe whatever I have to do will just... come to me.

92
00:06:31,272 --> 00:06:34,167
I think you can do it, Aang.

93
00:06:34,276 --> 00:06:39,978
Yehhh, we're all gonna get eaten by a spirit monster.

94
00:06:47,915 --> 00:06:49,929
Who's there?

95
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:58,084
A meadow vole! I should have known. You startled me, little one.

96
00:06:58,172 --> 00:07:03,542
Ehh, seems I've dozed off and missed my nephew's deadline,...

97
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:09,313
...but it was a very sweet nap.

98
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:20,822
He's a Fire Nation soldier.

99
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:26,270
He's no ordinary soldier. This is the Fire Lord's brother, the Dragon of the West,...

100
00:07:26,383 --> 00:07:33,780
...the once great General Iroh, but now, he's our prisoner.

101
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:49,092
Hello? Spirit, can you hear me? This is the Avatar speaking.

102
00:07:49,195 --> 00:07:51,993
I'm... here to try to help stuff.

103
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:53,176
This isn't right.

104
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,964
We can't sit here and cower while Aang waits for some monster to show up.

105
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:59,506
If anyone can save us, he can.

106
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:04,067
He still shouldn't have to face this alone.

107
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:12,340
The sun has set. Where are you, Hei-Bai?

108
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:20,732
Well, spirit, uh, I hereby ask you to please leave this village in peace!

109
00:08:22,357 --> 00:08:27,848
Okay. Well, I guess that's settled then.

110
00:08:45,997 --> 00:08:51,634
You must be the Hei-Bai spirit. My name is...

111
00:08:55,213 --> 00:09:01,939
My name is Aang! I'm the Avatar and I would like to help! Hey, wait up!

112
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:16,975
The Avatar's methods are... unusual.

113
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:20,733
It doesn't seem too interested in what he's saying. Maybe we should go help him?

114
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,319
No, only the Avatar stands a chance against the Hei-Bai.

115
00:09:25,422 --> 00:09:30,088
Aang will figure out the right thing to do, Sokka.

116
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:34,886
Please, would you stop destroying things and listen?

117
00:09:34,998 --> 00:09:37,591
I'm just trying to do my job as spirit bridge.

118
00:09:37,684 --> 00:09:45,823
Excuse me, would you please turn around? I command you to turn around now!

119
00:09:49,102 --> 00:09:50,832
That's it! He needs help!

120
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:52,927
Sokka wait!

121
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,143
It's not safe!

122
00:09:55,348 --> 00:09:58,279
Hei-Bai! Over here!

123
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,641
Sokka, go back!

124
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,478
We'll fight him together, Aang.

125
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:08,667
I don't wanna fight him unless I... huh!

126
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:14,371
Sokka!

127
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:23,736
Uncle! Uncle, where are you?

128
00:10:23,846 --> 00:10:26,011
Sir, maybe he thought you left without him?

129
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:30,288
Something's not right here. That pile of rocks...

130
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:32,755
It looks like there's been a landslide, Sir.

131
00:10:32,863 --> 00:10:37,806
Land doesn't slide uphill. Those rocks didn't move naturally.

132
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:41,787
My uncle's been captured by earthbenders!

133
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:54,235
Aang, over here!

134
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:01,732
Help!

135
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:04,431
Hang on, Sokka!

136
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,675
Sokka!

137
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,411
I failed.

138
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,630
Where are you taking me?

139
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:44,760
We're taking you to face justice.

140
00:11:44,857 --> 00:11:48,280
Right. But where, specifically?

141
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,976
A place you're quite familiar with, actually.

142
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:57,048
You once laid siege to it for 600 days, but it would not yield to you.

143
00:11:57,148 --> 00:12:01,311
Ah! The great city of Ba Sing Se.

144
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,082
It was greater than you were, apparently.

145
00:12:04,176 --> 00:12:07,842
I acknowledged my defeat at Ba Sing Se!

146
00:12:07,946 --> 00:12:17,120
After 600 days away from home, my men were tired and I was tired,...

147
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:21,523
...and I'm still tired.

148
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:42,615
I'm sure they'll be back.

149
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,017
I know.

150
00:12:46,148 --> 00:12:48,534
You should get some rest.

151
00:12:48,619 --> 00:12:51,724
Everything's gonna be okay.

152
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:58,612
Your brother is in good hands. I would be shocked if the Avatar returned without him.

153
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:03,342
Katara, Katara I lost him.

154
00:13:04,463 --> 00:13:09,372
The sun is rising. Perhaps he will return soon.

155
00:13:09,462 --> 00:13:13,266
What? No, I'm right here!

156
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:23,644
I'm in the spirit world!

157
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:35,463
Yup, that's Uncle Iroh.

158
00:13:37,473 --> 00:13:40,199
I'll figure this out, Katara, I promise.

159
00:13:40,318 --> 00:13:43,337
Like they said, I'm the bridge between the worlds, right?

160
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:50,771
All I have to do is... figure out what I have to do. But once I do that, no problem!

161
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:59,325
Appa! Hey buddy, I'm right here. But, I guess you can't see me either.

162
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:03,112
It's ok, Appa. Dont' worry. I'm sure they're on their way back.

163
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:08,504
I bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat.

164
00:14:09,036 --> 00:14:11,575
What am I supposed to do?

165
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,118
Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you?

166
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:18,848
Sokka?

167
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,634
That's definitely not Sokka!

168
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:41,178
What? I can't airbend in the spirit world!

169
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,564
You don't know where Sokka is, do you?

170
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:11,857
You're Avatar Roku's animal guide! Like Appa is to me.

171
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,212
I need to save my friend and I don't know how.

172
00:15:14,326 --> 00:15:18,740
Is there some way for me to talk to Roku?

173
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:27,949
I'll be back Katara. Take me to Roku!

174
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:44,705
What's the problem?

175
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:50,114
Nothing. Actually, there is a bit of a problem.

176
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:55,951
My old joints are feeling sore and achy and these shackles are too loose.

177
00:15:56,074 --> 00:15:57,297
Too loose?

178
00:15:57,391 --> 00:16:02,597
That's right. The cuffs are loose and they jangle around and bump my wrists.

179
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:07,796
It would help me if you would tighten them so they wouldn't shake around so much.

180
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:13,426
Very well. Corporal, tighten the prisoner's hand cuffs.

181
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,023
Hey, what are you doing!?

182
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,678
I don't understand. This is just a statue of Roku.

183
00:17:01,223 --> 00:17:09,814
Is that what Roku wants to talk to me about? A comet? When can I talk to him?

184
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:39,763
It's a calendar, and the light will reach Roku on the solstice!

185
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:43,695
So, that's when I'll be able to speak to Roku?

186
00:17:43,827 --> 00:17:49,223
But I can't wait that long.
I need to save Sokka now.

187
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:05,728
He is too dangerous, Captain. We can't just carry him to the capital.

188
00:18:05,838 --> 00:18:07,420
We have to do something now.

189
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:13,862
I agree. He must be dealt with immediately and severely.

190
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,737
It's no use, Appa. I don't see them anywhere.

191
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:23,836
Our best hope is to go back to the village and wait.

192
00:18:29,021 --> 00:18:31,665
The Avatar!

193
00:19:14,884 --> 00:19:16,872
You're back!

194
00:19:17,811 --> 00:19:19,725
Where's Sokka?

195
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,211
I'm not sure.

196
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:31,102
These dangerous hands must be crushed.

197
00:19:40,406 --> 00:19:42,939
Excellent form, Prince Zuko.

198
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:44,236
You taught me well.

199
00:19:44,345 --> 00:19:49,402
Surrender yourselves, it's five against two. You're clearly outnumbered.

200
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:56,266
Uh, that's true, but you are clearly outmatched!

201
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:35,195
Now would you please put on some clothes!

202
00:20:55,983 --> 00:21:00,212
Aang, what are you doing? Run!

203
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:20,260
You're the spirit of this forest. Now I understand.

204
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:24,062
You're upset and angry because your home was burned down.

205
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:27,266
When I saw the forest had burned I was sad and upset.

206
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:32,671
But my friend gave me hope that the forest would grow back.

207
00:21:50,438 --> 00:21:52,849
Sokka!

208
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:54,373
What happened?

209
00:21:54,464 --> 00:21:58,848
You were trapped in the Spirit world for 24 hours. How are you feeling?

210
00:21:58,962 --> 00:22:02,905
Like I seriously need to use the bathroom!

211
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:08,386
Thank you, Avatar. If there only were a way to repay you for what you've done.

212
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:11,242
You could give us some supplies and some money.

213
00:22:11,379 --> 00:22:12,291
Sokka!

214
00:22:12,385 --> 00:22:14,615
What? We need stuff.

215
00:22:14,714 --> 00:22:18,630
It would be an honor to help you prepare for your journey.

216
00:22:18,722 --> 00:22:22,834
I'm so proud of you, Aang. You figured out what to do all on your own.

217
00:22:22,955 --> 00:22:29,407
Actually, I did have a little help. And there's something else.

218
00:22:30,778 --> 00:22:31,572
What is it?

219
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:35,845
I need to talk to Roku and I think I've found a way to contact his spirit.

220
00:22:36,002 --> 00:22:37,029
That's great!

221
00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:38,634
Creepy, but great.

222
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:41,138
There's a temple on a crescent shaped island,...

223
00:22:41,251 --> 00:22:44,790
...and if I go there on the solstice I'll be able to speak with him.

224
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,852
But, the solstice is tomorrow.

225
00:22:46,947 --> 00:22:54,379
Yeh, and there's one more problem. The island is in the Fire Nation.

226
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:57,206
