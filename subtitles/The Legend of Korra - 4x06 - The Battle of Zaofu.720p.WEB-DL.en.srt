1
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:09,473
Earth.

2
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:11,375
Fire.

3
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:13,143
Air.

4
00:00:13,145 --> 00:00:14,445
Water.

5
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:18,682
Only the Avatar can
master all four elements

6
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:21,142
and bring balance to the world.

7

8
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:29,393
Kuvira threatens to take Zaofu by force.

9
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:31,462
After tensions flared between Su Beifong

10
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:34,398
and her former protege,
Korra brokered a truce.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,400
But it was too late.

12
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:37,334
Su and her sons were already on their way

13
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:38,369
to put an end to Kuvira.

14
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,337
Meanwhile, Bolin and
Varrick learned of Kuvira's

15
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:42,873
true tyrannical intent
and deserted her army.

16
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,742
But they were captured
and betrayed by Zhu Li.

17
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:47,845
Now they're being held against their will.

18
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,066
Are you sure this will work?

19
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:12,336
Even without Kuvira,
they could still crush us.

20
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:13,904
Most of this army has been forced

21
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:14,972
into service by Kuvira.

22
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,841
If we take her out, they'll
have no reason to fight.

23
00:01:17,843 --> 00:01:22,947
Tonight we end her reign of terror.

24
00:01:56,581 --> 00:01:58,482
She's alone in there.

25
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:02,586
Now's our chance.

26
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,697
- Don't hurt me!
- Zhu Li?

27
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:22,940
I knew you'd try a sneak attack.

28
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,342
You were afraid to step up
and lead the earth kingdom

29
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:28,879
when you had the chance,
you were afraid to join me

30
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:30,147
when I became the leader,

31
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:32,816
and now you're afraid of a fair fight.

32
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:35,919
You've always been a coward.

33
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:39,623
Take them.

34
00:02:40,392 --> 00:02:41,959
Korra, you have to go stop Su

35
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,827
before she does something terrible.

36
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,896
Stop her? We should be helping her!

37
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:49,800
We have no idea where your
mom is or what her plan is.

38
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,602
If we go charging into Kuvira's camp,

39
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,538
we could get them all captured or worse.

40
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,540
All we can do now is wait.

41
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,443
Attention, citizens of Zaofu.

42
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:03,147
Your leader, Su Beifong,
attempted to attack me

43
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:07,351
tonight while I slept,
ignoring the terms of our truce.

44
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:11,955
Luckily, I now have her and
her assault team in custody.

45
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:12,790
No.

46
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,459
Rest assured that I will not take revenge

47
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,795
on the peaceful citizens of Zaofu,

48
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,064
as long as your remaining representatives

49
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,800
meet me outside the city at dawn to offer

50
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:27,404
the full and unconditional
surrender of your city.

51
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:28,205
That is all.

52
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:31,375
Korra, you can't let
Kuvira get away with this.

53
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,677
We have to go break
out mom and my brothers.

54
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:35,479
You swore an oath of nonaggression

55
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,181
when you became an airbender.

56
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,450
You can't just attack Kuvira.

57
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,851
I don't care about the oath.

58
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,686
I have to save my family.

59
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:44,021
No, Jinora is right.

60
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,689
Your mom attacked the camp.

61
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:48,692
Kuvira was just defending herself.

62
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:49,860
Defending herself?

63
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,595
She was going to attack our city!

64
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:53,997
I can't believe you're refusing to fight.

65
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:57,034
Why is that loudspeaker lady talking

66
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:00,104
when I'm trying to sleep?

67
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,638
Korra, what are we going to do?

68
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,907
Jinora and I will go
talk to Kuvira at dawn,

69
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:05,742
and maybe we can work something out.

70
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:10,047
I promise I'll do everything
I can to keep the peace.

71
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,181
I'll go with you.

72
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:12,716
- We'll go, too.
- No.

73
00:04:12,718 --> 00:04:15,919
Dad told us to find
Korra, and we found her.

74
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:17,654
Now you need to stay safe.

75
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:19,790
Come on, let us help.

76
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,192
I can't risk anyone else being captured.

77
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:23,727
You can stay with Baatar and Huan

78
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:25,462
while I work this out with Kuvira.

79
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:26,997
Make sure they get back to Tenzin safely

80
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:29,500
if anything goes wrong.

81
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:30,200
Aw, man.

82
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:33,937
When am I gonna see some action?

83
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,675
Cookie jar empty.

84
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:41,712
No hot towels.

85
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,714
Waxy buildup.

86
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,083
Zhu Li!

87
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:51,955
Aw, she really is gone.

88
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:56,927
Up and at 'em, Varrick. Time to go to work.

89
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,962
We have another lab set up for you.

90
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:02,099
Kuvira wants the spirit
vine weapon operational

91
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,233
as soon as possible.

92
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:05,836
Zhu Li always greeted me in the morning

93
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,804
with a... a hot cup of tea.

94
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:10,574
You'll get your tea when you start working.

95
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:11,942
Well, I'm really only productive

96
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:12,976
for about 15 minutes a day,

97
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:17,614
usually in the afternoon around 3:45.

98
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:19,082
You'll work now.

99
00:05:19,084 --> 00:05:22,219
I want you to show me how the device works.

100
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,054
What's going on?

101
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:26,356
Go back to sleep. We only need Varrick.

102
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:29,693
You'll need your energy when
you get to the reeducation camp.

103
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:32,796
I can't be expected to
work without an assistant.

104
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:34,565
Without Zhu Li, I'm helpless.

105
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,668
One of the guards will be your assistant.

106
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,670
I'll be supervising.

107
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,836
Well, I guess he'll be fine,

108
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:42,839
as long as he doesn't
need his hands afterwards.

109
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:45,075
What's he talking about, sir?

110
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:47,177
The last time we worked
with the spirit vines,

111
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:49,680
it created an uncontrollable blast

112
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,248
that burned through a
wall and could still be

113
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,116
blowing up comets in
space, as far as I know.

114
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:56,653
I wouldn't want to assist me if I were you.

115
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:59,990
Maybe we should just
let the kid help him out.

116
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,326
Fine. Bolin can assist.

117
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,728
Wait, what? I need my hands! Uh, hold on.

118
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:10,567
Can we get breakfast first?
While we still have hands?

119
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:22,646
Release them now!

120
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:26,083
If Su agrees to bow to
me and turn over Zaofu,

121
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:29,720
she and the rest of your
family will not be harmed.

122
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,289
Never! I'll never bow to you!

123
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,158
There must be some way
for us to resolve this.

124
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,994
I've already laid out my terms,

125
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,229
and I think they're very reasonable.

126
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:41,665
After all, Su did try to take me out

127
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,767
during our peaceful negotiations.

128
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:48,138
You call bringing an army to
threaten our city peaceful?

129
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,972
Where's Bolin?

130
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:51,008
I know he would never go along with this!

131
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,276
Bolin is with my fiance,

132
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,311
working on something very important,

133
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,681
but I assure you he's
on board with my plans.

134
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,950
You two have been apart for some time.

135
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:03,820
I guess you don't realize
how much Bolin has grown up.

136
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:06,034
Now turn over Zaofu.

137
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:08,356
I can't just let you take the city.

138
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:11,192
Avatar Korra, you are interfering

139
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:13,561
with internal earth empire business

140
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:15,496
and letting your personal feelings

141
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:16,664
get in the way of reason.

142
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:20,335
Zaofu cannot continue to rule itself.

143
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:22,236
They have been hoarding their riches

144
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:23,671
and technology too long.

145
00:07:23,673 --> 00:07:26,941
I'm here to distribute
those resources fairly

146
00:07:26,943 --> 00:07:28,309
throughout the nation.

147
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:30,678
This is about equality.

148
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,047
You don't care about equality!

149
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:34,449
This is about control!

150
00:07:34,451 --> 00:07:35,416
Just take her down.

151
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:37,185
You know it's the right thing to do.

152
00:07:37,187 --> 00:07:38,187
You have to stop this!

153
00:07:38,188 --> 00:07:41,189
The only way you're going
to keep me from marching

154
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:44,459
into Zaofu is if you physically stop me.

155
00:07:44,461 --> 00:07:46,060
Now what are you going to do?

156
00:07:46,062 --> 00:07:49,631
It looks like you're
not giving me a choice.

157
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:50,498
Fine.

158
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,368
I want you all to know that I would never

159
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,769
ask any of you to do something

160
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:57,538
that I'm not willing to do myself.

161
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,574
So rather than risk your lives,

162
00:07:59,576 --> 00:08:03,578
I will fight the
Avatar one-on-one.

163
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,712
Korra, if you win,

164
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:08,116
then you can do whatever
you want with Zaofu.

165
00:08:08,118 --> 00:08:09,317
But after I beat you,

166
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:11,753
I want you out of my business for good.

167
00:08:11,755 --> 00:08:16,290
I'm the one who brought peace
to the earth empire, not you.

168
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:18,292
You're not relevant here anymore.

169
00:08:18,294 --> 00:08:20,495
Fine. You want to fight the Avatar?

170
00:08:20,497 --> 00:08:25,199
Then let's finish this
right here, right now!

171
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:38,146
Are you really ready to fight her?

172
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:40,715
Just stay back and let me handle this.

173
00:08:40,717 --> 00:08:41,649
It's been a while,

174
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:43,618
but I got a lot of pent-up rage.

175
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,920
Don't mess around. Kuvira is too good.

176
00:08:45,922 --> 00:08:48,790
Just go into the Avatar
state and get it over with.

177
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:53,461
No, I'm only going to
use that as a last resort.

178
00:08:53,463 --> 00:08:56,197
Be careful.

179
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:02,270
Use whatever you want, all the elements,

180
00:09:02,272 --> 00:09:05,540
the Avatar state, anything you need.

181
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:08,342
I know you're a little rusty.

182
00:09:08,344 --> 00:09:11,679
Enough talk.

183
00:09:26,596 --> 00:09:30,498
Looks like the Avatar
is a little off her game.

184
00:09:33,403 --> 00:09:35,203
Don't let her get you frustrated!

185
00:09:35,205 --> 00:09:38,639
She wants you to make a mistake!

186
00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:21,015
Bolin, do the thing.

187
00:10:21,017 --> 00:10:22,650
- What thing?
- The thing!

188
00:10:22,652 --> 00:10:25,386
I never had to tell Zhu Li what thing!

189
00:10:25,388 --> 00:10:26,388
I'm not Zhu Li, okay?

190
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:27,588
Pretend I don't know anything

191
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,890
about anything that's happening here.

192
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:31,392
Also pretend I don't want
to build a super weapon

193
00:10:31,394 --> 00:10:34,295
or get my hands blown off.

194
00:10:39,868 --> 00:10:41,636
Walk me through what you're doing.

195
00:10:41,638 --> 00:10:43,638
I want to know every detail of your work.

196
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,339
You know, when I started
working with the vines,

197
00:10:45,341 --> 00:10:48,509
the point was to find a clean,
unlimited source of energy,

198
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:51,212
not develop some spirity death ray.

199
00:10:51,214 --> 00:10:52,680
Clean energy, sounds great!

200
00:10:52,682 --> 00:10:55,783
Who doesn't like that
stuff? Let's do that instead.

201
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:56,484
Quiet.

202
00:10:56,486 --> 00:10:58,553
You're here to help, not talk.

203
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:00,888
And you of all people should realize

204
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,890
that once a discovery is made,

205
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:04,559
it is our responsibility as scientists

206
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:08,529
to pursue it as far as
we can, wherever it leads.

207
00:11:08,531 --> 00:11:09,697
How would you know?

208
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:11,065
You couldn't discover a wolf-bat

209
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:13,634
if it was building a nest in your butt.

210
00:11:13,636 --> 00:11:16,037
Ooh.

211
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,438
You're pathetic.

212
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,640
Wolf-bats don't build nests.

213
00:11:19,642 --> 00:11:21,976
Ooh, you got me there, Dr. science.

214
00:11:21,978 --> 00:11:26,414
You'll never know how it
feels to give birth to genius,

215
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,517
only to have it kidnapped
and raised by fools.

216
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,785
Are you done with your rambling,

217
00:11:30,787 --> 00:11:32,854
or do the guards need to encourage you

218
00:11:32,856 --> 00:11:34,422
to continue your work?

219
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:36,357
Okay, okay, okay.

220
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:38,926
The last time we ran the
current through the vine,

221
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:40,228
we couldn't control the power.

222
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,633
So I'm trying something new
to see if I can direct it.

223
00:12:37,453 --> 00:12:39,020
Come on, Avatar.

224
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:39,954
Get up.

225
00:12:39,956 --> 00:12:41,522
Show me what you've got.

226
00:12:41,524 --> 00:12:44,058
We have to help her.

227
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,328
No. Stay back.

228
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,932
I can handle this.

229
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:53,501
So I see how the current
interacts with the vine,

230
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:55,670
and here is a kind of directional tube,

231
00:12:55,672 --> 00:12:57,605
but this baffling here at the base...

232
00:12:58,408 --> 00:13:00,641
It looks like that would
only redirect the energy

233
00:13:00,643 --> 00:13:01,876
right back where it came from.

234
00:13:01,878 --> 00:13:04,445
And what's that piece of
equipment you're fiddling with

235
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:05,813
now on the power source?

236
00:13:05,815 --> 00:13:07,815
Hand me the
screw-turn-thingy, would ya?

237
00:13:07,817 --> 00:13:10,151
Ugh, I can't believe you're helping them.

238
00:13:10,153 --> 00:13:11,719
You know this isn't right.

239
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:12,687
Funny story, Bolin.

240
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:15,489
I first got the idea for
harnessing spirit power

241
00:13:15,491 --> 00:13:17,792
when I watched that giant Unalaq monster

242
00:13:17,794 --> 00:13:19,961
attack the city from my jail cell.

243
00:13:19,963 --> 00:13:22,897
That giant monster set me free.

244
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:27,335
Trust me, kid. I know what I'm doing.

245
00:13:27,903 --> 00:13:31,939
That ought to do it.

246
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:34,342
Huh.

247
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,645
Okay, stand back.

248
00:13:37,647 --> 00:13:38,813
There we go.

249
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:40,614
What's that ticking?

250
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:41,849
That's the timer.

251
00:13:41,851 --> 00:13:43,417
The timer for what?

252
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:44,952
For the bomb, of course!

253
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:45,920
What? What bomb?

254
00:13:45,922 --> 00:13:48,055
The bomb that's going to
explode in five minutes

255
00:13:48,057 --> 00:13:50,958
and destroy this entire
train, all of the spirit vines,

256
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,561
and everything else
within a few hundred yards.

257
00:13:53,563 --> 00:13:56,530
You know what, I'd get
out of here if I were you.

258
00:13:56,532 --> 00:13:58,566
This is the first time I've built a timer,

259
00:13:58,568 --> 00:13:59,967
and it might run a little fast.

260
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:02,036
Bolin and I are ready to
go down with the ship...

261
00:14:02,038 --> 00:14:03,070
or train in this case...

262
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:06,107
but you seem like you
have a lot to live for.

263
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:07,008
No, no, no, no!

264
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,909
I'm not ready to go down
with the ship or the train!

265
00:14:08,911 --> 00:14:09,977
You're bluffing.

266
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:11,712
Stick around five minutes,

267
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:13,547
and you'll find out who's bluffing.

268
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:15,916
You'll be sorry you left me, Zhu Li!

269
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:17,218
When they write the history books,

270
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,787
your name will be synonymous with betrayal!

271
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:22,056
People will say, "hey,
what happened to that guy?"

272
00:14:22,058 --> 00:14:23,190
"Oh, didn't you hear,

273
00:14:23,192 --> 00:14:26,560
he Varrick'd himself because
some girl Zhu Li'd him!"

274
00:14:26,562 --> 00:14:27,661
Enough.

275
00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:31,065
What makes you think we'd
let you blow yourself up?

276
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:32,867
You're working for Kuvira.

277
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:34,735
You don't get to quit.

278
00:14:34,737 --> 00:14:37,004
Grab him.

279
00:14:38,273 --> 00:14:39,840
You try to pull me away from this thing,

280
00:14:39,842 --> 00:14:42,743
and I'll hit this remote
and blow it immediately.

281
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:44,812
Why do you have a timer and a remote?

282
00:14:44,814 --> 00:14:46,747
Well, first I built the
timer, but then I thought

283
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:49,183
you could drag me off the
train, so then I built a remote.

284
00:14:49,185 --> 00:14:50,618
But then I thought, "well, now",

285
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,919
"do I really need the timer anymore?

286
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:53,154
Because I got a remote in my"...

287
00:14:53,156 --> 00:14:55,022
whatever! I'm covering all my bases!

288
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:59,093
The point is, you're
leaving. We're staying.

289
00:15:10,486 --> 00:15:13,555
You have to go into the Avatar state!

290
00:15:13,557 --> 00:15:16,058
Do it!

291
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,432
I don't understand.

292
00:15:57,434 --> 00:15:58,767
We got the poison out.

293
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:01,603
What's wrong with her?

294
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:07,509
I knew you were weak.

295
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:42,344
You broke our agreement!

296
00:16:42,346 --> 00:16:43,545
Attack!

297
00:17:02,565 --> 00:17:07,803
Keep them back! I'm calling for help.

298
00:17:14,144 --> 00:17:15,644
Stunning work, Ikki.

299
00:17:15,646 --> 00:17:20,749
It hurts my eyes with
its raw emotional power.

300
00:17:27,657 --> 00:17:28,657
Ah, pedestrian.

301
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:31,359
I already know what you
look like on the outside.

302
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:35,430
I want you to show me the inner Meelo.

303
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:37,933
Help!

304
00:17:37,935 --> 00:17:39,668
You have to get Korra and the rest of us

305
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,369
out of here now!

306
00:17:41,371 --> 00:17:41,937
Hurry!

307
00:17:41,939 --> 00:17:45,474
Finally! Let's get it on!

308
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:48,810
This is everyone. Our
half of the train is clear.

309
00:17:48,812 --> 00:17:51,613
That's good. We're almost out of time.

310
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,380
You're insane.

311
00:17:52,382 --> 00:17:54,783
You knew that when you hired me.

312
00:17:54,785 --> 00:17:56,852
Bolin, do the thing.

313
00:17:56,854 --> 00:17:57,819
Uh...

314
00:17:57,821 --> 00:17:58,821
Unhook the cars!

315
00:17:58,822 --> 00:18:03,291
Oh, come on, that was an easy one!

316
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:09,631
Man, that was great.

317
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:11,533
I gotta admit, you had me
going there for a while.

318
00:18:11,535 --> 00:18:13,869
I really thought you
were going to blow us up.

319
00:18:13,871 --> 00:18:15,604
Now, how do we turn this thing off?

320
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:18,840
Oh, we can't turn it off.
We're going to blow up.

321
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:21,009
But we had a pretty good run, right?

322
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:22,577
What are you talking about, a good run?

323
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:25,814
I'm still running! I like running!

324
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:42,631
I'll see you on the other side, Zhu Li.

325
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:46,601
I want you to know, I hate you.

326
00:18:55,778 --> 00:18:58,713
I can't believe he
actually blew himself up.

327
00:18:58,715 --> 00:19:03,318
That man was crazier than
a sewer-pipe elephant rat.

328
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,521
Let's get back to Zaofu.

329
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,700
Yes! You did it, Bolin.

330
00:19:18,702 --> 00:19:20,502
You did the thing.

331
00:19:20,504 --> 00:19:22,437
Mwah!

332
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:23,104
I can't believe

333
00:19:23,106 --> 00:19:27,209
Zhu Li worked for you as long as she did.

334
00:19:44,694 --> 00:19:47,596
Dive, pepper! Dive!

335
00:19:47,598 --> 00:19:50,599
Here comes a hurricane!

336
00:19:52,702 --> 00:19:55,837
You can't handle all this Meelo!

337
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,507
We've got her! Go!

338
00:20:00,543 --> 00:20:02,477
We have to save them!

339
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:04,446
Opal, get out of here!

340
00:20:04,448 --> 00:20:05,847
We'll be fine!

341
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:06,548
Just go!

342
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,352
I'll be back for you! I love you!

343
00:20:14,891 --> 00:20:17,626
Zaofu is ours!

344
00:20:26,903 --> 00:20:29,905
Bring the citizens of Zaofu to kneel

345
00:20:29,907 --> 00:20:31,840
before the Great Uniter.

346
00:20:31,842 --> 00:20:34,409
All who pledge their loyalty to me

347
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:36,711
will keep their freedom
and be dealt with fairly

348
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:39,915
as full citizens of the earth empire.

349
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:42,751
The rest will be imprisoned as traitors,

350
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:46,521
like Su Beifong and her sons.

351
00:20:46,523 --> 00:20:48,957
Now bow.

352
00:20:58,701 --> 00:21:00,969
Bow to her! Do it!

353
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:04,639
She is your rightful leader!

354
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:09,711
I'm so disappointed in you, junior.

355
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:12,647
Take them away!

356
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:14,082
Get your hands off me.

357
00:21:14,084 --> 00:21:17,519
You're crushing my individuality.

358
00:21:17,521 --> 00:21:20,855
All hail the Great Uniter!

359
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:34,869
Are you sure there's no way they survived?

360
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:37,605
Positive, but I think
I can replicate his work

361
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:41,576
with the spirit vines
and get us back on track.

362
00:21:41,578 --> 00:21:45,547
I'll just need an assistant.

363
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,452
How would you like to help Baatar build

364
00:21:50,454 --> 00:21:53,955
the most powerful weapon
the world has ever seen?

365
00:21:53,957 --> 00:21:58,526
It would be my honor, Great Uniter.

366
00:22:01,897 --> 00:22:06,134
Begin dismantling the domes.

367
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:12,402
