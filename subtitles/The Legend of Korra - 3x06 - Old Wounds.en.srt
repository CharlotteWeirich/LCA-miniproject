1
00:00:00,485 --> 00:00:02,488
Earth.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,323
Fire.

3
00:00:04,325 --> 00:00:05,992
Air.

4
00:00:05,994 --> 00:00:08,194
Water.

5
00:00:08,196 --> 00:00:12,365
Only the Avatar can master all four elements

6
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:15,952
and bring balance to the world.

7

8
00:00:20,174 --> 00:00:22,041
Lin Beifong has a sister.

9
00:00:22,043 --> 00:00:24,126
After arriving in Zaofu, Korra met Opal,

10
00:00:24,128 --> 00:00:27,463
a new airbender,
whose mother is Lin's estranged half-sister.

11
00:00:27,465 --> 00:00:29,882
Suyin and her daughter
welcomed Lin with open arms,

12
00:00:29,884 --> 00:00:31,717
but she wanted nothing to do with them.

13
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:34,053
Meanwhile,
Zaheer infiltrated air temple island

14
00:00:34,055 --> 00:00:36,055
looking for the Avatar.

15
00:00:36,057 --> 00:00:37,557
After battling with Kya, he escaped

16
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,059
and is now a wanted man in Republic City.

17
00:00:40,528 --> 00:00:43,713
__

18
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:54,073
Hey, has anyone seen chief Beifong?

19
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,075
She's probably off sulking in her room.

20
00:00:56,077 --> 00:00:57,577
I know she has a problem with me,

21
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:59,629
but she had no right to
yell at Opal last night.

22
00:01:00,748 --> 00:01:03,749
All set for your power disc game today,
guys?

23
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:06,469
Yeah, all set to kick Wei's butt.

24
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:08,254
I'm going to power disc your face.

25
00:01:08,256 --> 00:01:10,590
You should come play with us.

26
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:13,092
Oh, I don't think I'd be much competition

27
00:01:13,094 --> 00:01:14,594
since I can't metalbend.

28
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:15,928
Really?

29
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,897
Lin never offered to train you?

30
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:20,800
Nope,
and I guess I never thought to bring it up

31
00:01:20,802 --> 00:01:22,468
because I was learning to airbend,

32
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,703
then there was the pro-bending,

33
00:01:23,705 --> 00:01:25,638
then I got tied up fighting the Equalists.

34
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,240
It was a busy few months.

35
00:01:27,242 --> 00:01:29,675
Well, it's probably for the best.

36
00:01:29,677 --> 00:01:31,377
I'm sure Lin would be a horrible teacher.

37
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:36,849
As the Avatar, you should have
mastery over all the elements.

38
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:39,085
I'd be happy to show you the basics.

39
00:01:39,087 --> 00:01:41,320
Really? That would be great.

40
00:01:41,322 --> 00:01:44,006
You should try it too.

41
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:46,626
Uh, nah, I'm more of an earth guy.

42
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:49,011
The dirt, rocks, you know,
maybe some light gravel...

43
00:01:49,013 --> 00:01:50,630
that's kind of where my heart is.

44
00:01:50,632 --> 00:01:52,431
Okay, earth guy.

45
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:55,468
Well, let me know if you change your mind.

46
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:02,475
Aah!

47
00:02:09,116 --> 00:02:11,617
It worked! Zhu-Li, mark it down.

48
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:13,986
Magnet suit test successful.

49
00:02:13,988 --> 00:02:16,289
Power down.

50
00:02:19,326 --> 00:02:23,045
On to phase two...
Zhu-Li cleans up this mess.

51
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:35,675
How many push-ups did you do last night?

52
00:02:35,677 --> 00:02:37,009
'Cause I did, like, 50.

53
00:02:37,011 --> 00:02:38,344
What do you two think you're doing?

54
00:02:38,346 --> 00:02:39,346
Get back to work.

55
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:43,683
Is everything all right here?

56
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:46,352
The Avatar is in danger,
and these two knuckleheads

57
00:02:46,354 --> 00:02:48,104
are just standing around chitchatting.

58
00:02:48,106 --> 00:02:49,322
Don't worry.

59
00:02:49,324 --> 00:02:52,692
Zaofu is the most secure city in the world.

60
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:54,327
I'll be the judge of that.

61
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:57,363
I'm going to check every inch of this place.

62
00:02:57,365 --> 00:03:00,616
Lin,
you do not have to work while you are here.

63
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:02,001
You need to relax.

64
00:03:02,003 --> 00:03:04,036
I'm fine!

65
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:05,705
Doesn't take a truthseer to know

66
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:09,008
that you are under a
dangerous amount of stress.

67
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,794
If you don't deal with
your repressed feelings,

68
00:03:11,796 --> 00:03:14,964
there will be severe
consequences to your health

69
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:16,549
and your job.

70
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:19,018
I'm not interested in
talking about my feelings.

71
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,021
You won't have to say a word.

72
00:03:22,023 --> 00:03:24,056
I know a great acupuncturist in town

73
00:03:24,058 --> 00:03:26,275
who will be able to help you.

74
00:03:29,946 --> 00:03:30,980
Hmm.

75
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:39,038
Seems like you made quite a
stir on air temple island.

76
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,241
The cops are swarming
the city looking for us.

77
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:44,577
You still want to try to
take out the president?

78
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:47,213
No. He'll have to wait.

79
00:03:47,215 --> 00:03:48,581
We leave today.

80
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:58,641
There's our ticket out of here.

81
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:11,237
There's no money.
I just made my last delivery.

82
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,439
We don't want money.

83
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,365
How many of those things
are you gonna stick in me?

84
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:25,534
I'll be placing several needles

85
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:27,787
on each of your acupoints.

86
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,705
There's nothing to be scared about.

87
00:04:29,707 --> 00:04:31,507
I'm not afraid of needles!

88
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:36,178
Please close your eyes
and take a deep breath.

89
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,605
This process will correct the imbalances

90
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:47,857
in your chi.

91
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:51,694
Please tell me if you
feel any pain or pressure.

92
00:04:51,696 --> 00:04:52,978
I can't feel a thing.

93
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,564
That's unusual.

94
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:58,651
Your chi must be powerfully blocked.

95
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:02,655
We're going to need more needles.

96
00:05:02,657 --> 00:05:06,826
Acupuncture often taps into
people's buried memories.

97
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:10,996
These memories can sometimes
be difficult to process.

98
00:05:10,998 --> 00:05:14,550
Buried memories, uh-huh.

99
00:05:20,508 --> 00:05:22,508
Su, what are you doing home?

100
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,843
Wow.

101
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,678
You almost look like a real cop.

102
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,731
You're supposed to be in school.

103
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,766
Oh, no. Are you gonna tell mom?

104
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:32,518
It's not like she's going to care.

105
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,236
Where'd you get all that stuff?

106
00:05:34,238 --> 00:05:36,238
Uh, fell off the back of a truck.

107
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,525
What are you doing hanging
out with these losers?

108
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:43,662
They're my friends,
and you have no right to call them that!

109
00:05:43,664 --> 00:05:46,282
Come on, guys,
let's get out of here.

110
00:05:46,284 --> 00:05:47,366
Su, stop!

111
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:49,702
Get your hands off of me!

112
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:52,505
You have so much potential.
You're ruining your life.

113
00:05:52,507 --> 00:05:56,258
At least I have a life.

114
00:06:03,884 --> 00:06:06,051
These meteorites are perfect
for beginning metalbenders.

115
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:08,470
The metals have a unique property,

116
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:11,557
making them easier to bend.

117
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:22,284
That's amazing.

118
00:06:22,286 --> 00:06:24,737
Here, try it.

119
00:06:24,739 --> 00:06:26,488
Okay.

120
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:39,001
Bolin, is that you?

121
00:06:39,003 --> 00:06:41,921
- No.
- What are you doing?

122
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:45,307
Oh, hey, ladies. I was just, uh...

123
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:48,177
I was just looking for Pabu. Pabu!

124
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:51,397
He's on your shoulder.

125
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,648
Oh, look, there you are.

126
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,100
You know,
I thought something was chewing on my ear.

127
00:06:55,102 --> 00:06:56,569
I'm probably gonna need to get a shot.

128
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:59,104
Pabu has sort of a venom... a venom.

129
00:06:59,106 --> 00:07:00,606
Anyway, so what are you guys doing?

130
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:02,324
You're metalbending over here or something?

131
00:07:02,326 --> 00:07:04,777
- Want to give it a shot?
- Nah, it's okay.

132
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:06,445
I mean, only, like,
one earthbender in a hundred

133
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:07,696
can metalbend.

134
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:09,498
Well, don't believe everything you hear.

135
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,951
The only thing limiting
you is your attitude.

136
00:07:11,953 --> 00:07:13,669
You know, well, maybe I'll just...

137
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:16,622
I'll just stay and watch.

138
00:07:28,102 --> 00:07:30,302
Try to focus on the fine pieces of earth

139
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:33,389
within the metal.

140
00:07:37,944 --> 00:07:40,946
I can't believe it. I'm metalbending!

141
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:44,650
Wow, you picked that up really,
really quick.

142
00:07:44,652 --> 00:07:47,152
I guess you're that one in a hundred.

143
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:50,039
Great job, Korra.

144
00:07:56,663 --> 00:07:57,997
Calling all units.

145
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:00,132
Robbery reported on the
corner of fifth and harbor.

146
00:08:00,134 --> 00:08:02,668
Suspects'
vehicle headed south on Hao Boulevard.

147
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,420
Units responding, identify.

148
00:08:04,422 --> 00:08:06,388
Unit three responding.

149
00:08:34,085 --> 00:08:36,535
Leave them alone!

150
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:40,255
Su?

151
00:08:47,647 --> 00:08:48,931
Wait.

152
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:51,633
Leaving in the middle of a
session could make you sick.

153
00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:52,635
I'm done here.

154
00:09:01,113 --> 00:09:02,746
Are you gonna stay in your room

155
00:09:02,748 --> 00:09:06,883
feeling sorry for yourself all day?

156
00:09:06,885 --> 00:09:09,052
You owe Opal an apology...

157
00:09:09,054 --> 00:09:11,888
For the way you treated her last night.

158
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,223
Are you okay?

159
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:15,892
- You don't look good.
- I'm fine.

160
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,101
What did you do to me?

161
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:27,671
I tried to warn you.

162
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,492
Come with me. Let's go finish the session.

163
00:09:34,745 --> 00:09:38,248
Just relax and breathe.

164
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:43,503
So you're robbing stores
with the Terra triad now?

165
00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:46,256
I didn't steal anything.
I just drove the car.

166
00:09:46,258 --> 00:09:48,391
I owed my friends a favor.
It's not a big deal.

167
00:09:48,393 --> 00:09:50,727
I'm not letting you get away with this.

168
00:09:50,729 --> 00:09:51,928
Oh.

169
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,982
What are you going to do,
officer, arrest me?

170
00:09:55,984 --> 00:09:59,235
Don't even think about taking one more step!

171
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:36,306
Good afternoon. Where are you off to today?

172
00:10:36,308 --> 00:10:38,892
I, uh, got a delivery to make in Bao Yu.

173
00:10:38,894 --> 00:10:41,895
I should be back later today.

174
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,481
You all right?

175
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:46,983
Yeah, just a little tired.

176
00:10:46,985 --> 00:10:48,952
One more pickup, then I'm clocking out.

177
00:10:48,954 --> 00:10:52,655
I thought you said you had a delivery.

178
00:10:52,657 --> 00:10:55,375
Did I?

179
00:10:55,377 --> 00:10:57,961
I'm gonna need you to
step out of the vehicle

180
00:10:57,963 --> 00:10:59,879
and open the back of the truck.

181
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,757
Hey, get back here!

182
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:19,682
Let's get out of here!

183
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:10,567
Hmm, hmm.

184
00:12:16,908 --> 00:12:19,325
Hey, Bolin.

185
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,494
Opal! Oh, wow.

186
00:12:21,496 --> 00:12:24,214
You really know how to sneak up on someone.

187
00:12:24,216 --> 00:12:25,331
What are you doing?

188
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,167
Oh, nothing, you know, just...

189
00:12:27,169 --> 00:12:31,921
just thinking about my body
and mustaches that I might have

190
00:12:31,923 --> 00:12:34,340
in the future.

191
00:12:34,342 --> 00:12:36,092
You're acting weird again.

192
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:37,927
Sorry.

193
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:40,763
I wasn't really thinking
about all my mustaches.

194
00:12:40,765 --> 00:12:43,099
I'm just... I'm just frustrated.

195
00:12:43,101 --> 00:12:46,269
I've been trying to metalbend,
and I can't figure it out.

196
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:48,271
Don't tell anyone, okay?

197
00:12:48,273 --> 00:12:51,107
- Why not?
- Because it's embarrassing.

198
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:52,992
This isn't the first time I've tried.

199
00:12:52,994 --> 00:12:54,694
I mean, I've been wanting to metalbend

200
00:12:54,696 --> 00:12:56,946
ever since I heard about Toph.

201
00:12:56,948 --> 00:13:00,416
Your grandmother is my biggest hero.

202
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:02,418
My mom grew up learning from Toph.

203
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,288
Just go train with her.
Stop being so scared.

204
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,372
You know what?

205
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:08,291
Maybe I am scared, but what about you?

206
00:13:08,293 --> 00:13:09,792
I know that you want to go

207
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:11,794
to the northern air temple
to train with Tenzin,

208
00:13:11,796 --> 00:13:14,631
but you haven't done it
because you're afraid too.

209
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:17,467
You know what? You're right.

210
00:13:17,469 --> 00:13:20,553
I don't want to leave my
family and disappoint my mom.

211
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,306
Look at us...

212
00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:28,194
Talking about our feelings,
supporting each other.

213
00:13:28,196 --> 00:13:29,946
It's nice.

214
00:13:42,493 --> 00:13:44,627
What were you thinking?

215
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:46,379
And what were you thinking?

216
00:13:46,381 --> 00:13:49,299
You two have put me in
an impossible position.

217
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:50,667
You're mad at me?

218
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:52,919
She's the one who was running
around with criminals.

219
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:54,637
This is all your fault!

220
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,673
I was doing my job!

221
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:59,592
Ugh, all right, enough!
Here's what we're going to do.

222
00:13:59,594 --> 00:14:02,895
Su, you need to leave the
city as soon as possible.

223
00:14:02,897 --> 00:14:05,265
What? Where am I supposed to go?

224
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:07,267
You'll go stay with your grandparents.

225
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:09,569
Lin, give me the arrest report.

226
00:14:12,523 --> 00:14:15,158
Mom, what are you doing?

227
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,827
You can't cover this up.
There were witnesses.

228
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:19,696
I'm the chief of police.

229
00:14:19,698 --> 00:14:21,948
I can't have a daughter in jail.

230
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,584
So, once again,
Su gets to do whatever she wants,

231
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:28,004
and there are no consequences.

232
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:31,874
This is our only option.

233
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:37,263
You're going to feel a bit fragile,

234
00:14:37,265 --> 00:14:41,384
so it's probably best if you
take it easy for a little while.

235
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:43,353
I don't need to rest.

236
00:14:43,355 --> 00:14:45,555
I need to do something I should've done

237
00:14:45,557 --> 00:14:47,557
a long time ago.

238
00:14:57,735 --> 00:14:59,118
Congratulations.

239
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,406
You're the first metalbending Avatar.

240
00:15:03,408 --> 00:15:07,076
So, um, I've been thinking,

241
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:09,412
and I'd like to try to learn metalbending.

242
00:15:09,414 --> 00:15:11,497
I mean, I'm sure you have

243
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:14,050
a waiting list or something,
like, a couple years, so...

244
00:15:14,052 --> 00:15:16,419
Let's get started.

245
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:26,262
I think Lin is mad about something.

246
00:15:26,264 --> 00:15:29,565
Su, it's time we talk.

247
00:15:34,274 --> 00:15:37,226
After 30 years,
you're finally ready to talk?

248
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,145
When we were in mom's office that day,

249
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,981
you could have taken
responsibility for what you did,

250
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,316
but instead you stayed quiet

251
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,234
and let mom throw her whole career away.

252
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,953
Mom didn't throw her career away.

253
00:15:46,955 --> 00:15:49,622
She retired the next year. She was a hero.

254
00:15:49,624 --> 00:15:51,657
You think she wanted to retire?

255
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,293
She was so guilt-ridden about
what she did to protect you,

256
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:55,695
she didn't feel worthy of her badge.

257
00:15:55,697 --> 00:15:58,464
Look, I admit that I was not a perfect kid

258
00:15:58,466 --> 00:16:00,266
and I've made some mistakes in the past,
but...

259
00:16:00,268 --> 00:16:03,002
You made some mistakes?

260
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,605
Lin,
mom and I already talked about this years ago

261
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:06,906
and worked things out.

262
00:16:06,908 --> 00:16:09,275
If you had gotten together
with us like we'd asked,

263
00:16:09,277 --> 00:16:11,344
you would know that I'm
a different person now.

264
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:14,046
I've been a different
person for a long time.

265
00:16:14,048 --> 00:16:16,782
You think just because you live in a big,
fancy house

266
00:16:16,784 --> 00:16:18,651
and have a chef who cooks you fancy food

267
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:20,286
that you're a different person?

268
00:16:20,288 --> 00:16:23,155
Maybe you can fool everyone else,
but you can't fool me.

269
00:16:23,157 --> 00:16:24,957
I see right through you.

270
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,125
You know what, Lin?

271
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:27,727
You're the one who hasn't changed.

272
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:30,796
You're still a bitter loner
who only cares about herself.

273
00:16:30,798 --> 00:16:33,199
No wonder Tenzin ended
things with you years ago.

274
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:40,539
Okay, I guess this is how it's going to be.

275
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,608
- Should I stop them?
- You don't have any siblings.

276
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,361
Fighting is all part of the healing process.

277
00:17:05,365 --> 00:17:07,149
Go, mom!

278
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,794
My sculpture!

279
00:17:22,582 --> 00:17:25,251
Actually, it looks kind of better now.

280
00:17:48,076 --> 00:17:49,742
You got it out of your system?

281
00:17:49,744 --> 00:17:51,360
Not quite yet!

282
00:17:57,617 --> 00:18:00,786
What are you two doing? You're sisters!

283
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,455
Why would you want to hurt each other?

284
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,940
Uh, who's gonna knock?

285
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:22,641
Oh! No, no, no, no, no, no.

286
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,310
Not me. You're the Avatar.

287
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,611
Why can't you do it?

288
00:18:25,613 --> 00:18:27,780
Uh, I can.

289
00:18:27,782 --> 00:18:29,448
But I just thought that you...

290
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,535
I'll do it.

291
00:18:32,537 --> 00:18:36,455
Uh, chief,
you've been sleeping for 16 hours.

292
00:18:36,457 --> 00:18:38,708
We just wanted to make
sure that you're okay.

293
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:39,710
Ooh!

294
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,249
Good morning.

295
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,175
What's this?

296
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,510
I call it the Kalenutsco.

297
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:01,180
It's a mixture of kale,
coconut water, and walnuts.

298
00:19:07,487 --> 00:19:09,572
Not bad.

299
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:13,325
Opal, don't go.

300
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:16,612
Please sit down. I want to talk to you.

301
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,288
Look, I'm just not really comfortable

302
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,873
talking about these kinds of things,

303
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,842
and, well...

304
00:19:29,844 --> 00:19:33,045
I wanted to say I'm sorry
about the other night.

305
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,463
It's okay.

306
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:38,017
Your mother and I have a
complicated relationship and...

307
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:40,636
it's probably difficult for you to be here.

308
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:46,609
You're a smart young woman
and an excellent airbender.

309
00:19:46,611 --> 00:19:49,278
I think it would be a wonderful
opportunity for you to train

310
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,148
with the other airbenders
at the northern air temple.

311
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,949
There's a part of me that wants to go,

312
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:57,203
but I don't want to upset my mom.

313
00:19:57,205 --> 00:19:58,320
When I was younger,

314
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,739
all I wanted to do was please my mother.

315
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,907
I became a police chief

316
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,243
because I thought it would make her happy,

317
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,578
but it didn't.

318
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,581
You need to make decisions
based on what you want.

319
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:12,585
Don't make the same mistakes I did.

320
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,393
Mom? Dad?

321
00:20:21,395 --> 00:20:23,929
Can I talk to you?

322
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,243
Opal has decided to go to
the northern air temple.

323
00:20:37,245 --> 00:20:39,445
I'm guessing you had something
to do with her decision.

324
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:40,779
Well, I was just...

325
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,782
it's okay. I'm glad she was honest with me.

326
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,785
I want her to do what makes her happy.

327
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,671
Mom gave us too much freedom,

328
00:20:48,673 --> 00:20:50,289
but I feel like I've made the mistake

329
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,124
of giving Opal too little.

330
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,544
I think it's time I let
her choose her own way.

331
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,264
I'm sorry I gave you such a
hard time when we were younger.

332
00:20:58,266 --> 00:21:00,683
I can't imagine what my
life would've been like

333
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:03,802
if mom hadn't sent me away,
if I had stayed in the city.

334
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,437
You'd probably be in prison.

335
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:08,474
You're probably right.

336
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,060
Mako told me that you're
an excellent police chief.

337
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,779
Republic City is lucky to have you.

338
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:16,232
I know mom is proud.

339
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,654
Can we move on?

340
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:24,073
I'd love for you to be
a part of my life again.

341
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,574
There's plenty of space
for you in the house,

342
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:28,294
and the kids would love
having their aunt around.

343
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:31,463
I do need a codirector for
my new dance performance.

344
00:21:31,465 --> 00:21:33,499
Whoa. Slow down.

345
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,918
How about for now, I just promise

346
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,504
not to show up at your
house and attack you again?

347
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,756
Deal.

348
00:21:51,237 --> 00:21:53,070
We should have grabbed one of those cops.

349
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:55,761
Maybe they know something about
where the Avatar is hiding.

350
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,436
She could be anywhere.

351
00:21:57,911 --> 00:21:59,000
We'll find her.

352
00:21:59,932 --> 00:22:01,934
It's just the matter of time.

353
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,141
She's with the metal clan.

354
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:13,665
