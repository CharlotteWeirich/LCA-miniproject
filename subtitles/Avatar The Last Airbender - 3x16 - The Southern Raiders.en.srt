1
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,124
Zuko: Watch out!

2
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:13,366
What are you doing?!

3
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,790
Keeping rocks from crushing you.

4
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:17,818
Okay, I’m not crushed.
You can get off me now.

5
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,238
I’ll take that as a thank you.

6
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:25,394
Come on,
we can get out through here!

7
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,781
What are you doing?

8
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:33,502
Go ahead, I’ll hold them off.
I think this is a family visit.

9
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:34,869
Zuko, no!

10
00:02:35,545 --> 00:02:37,345
Come on,
we gotta get out of here.

11
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:54,089
What are you doing here?

12
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,499
You mean it’s not obvious yet?

13
00:02:56,831 --> 00:02:59,831
I’m about to celebrate
becoming an only child!

14
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:37,671
I can’t get him to go in there.
Appa hates tunnels.

15
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:40,733
Aang, there’s no way
we can fly out of here.

16
00:03:41,163 --> 00:03:42,663
We’ll have to find a way.

17
00:03:42,946 --> 00:03:47,346
We need to split up.
Take the tunnel and get to the stolen airship.

18
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:52,668
No, the Fire Nation
can’t separate our family again.

19
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:55,369
It’ll be okay,
it’s not forever.

20
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,640
I can clear that away
and we can fly out through there.

21
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:17,155
Umm, there’s an awful
lot of fire in that general direction.

22
00:04:17,926 --> 00:04:20,026
We’ll get through,
let’s go.

23
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:38,248
She’s not going to make it.

24
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:45,345
Of course she did.

25
00:05:54,114 --> 00:05:57,714
Aang: Wow, camping.
It really seems like old times again, doesn’t it?

26
00:05:58,002 --> 00:06:01,302
If you really want to
feel like old times, I could, uhh…

27
00:06:01,456 --> 00:06:03,756
chase you around a
while and try to capture you.

28
00:06:05,318 --> 00:06:06,318
Haha.

29
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:14,251
To Zuko. Who knew after all those times
he tried to snuff us out, today, he be our hero.

30
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:15,699
Here, here.

31
00:06:16,996 --> 00:06:19,796
I’m touched.
I don’t deserve this.

32
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:21,428
Yeah, no kidding.

33
00:06:23,521 --> 00:06:26,021
- What’s with her?
-  I wish I knew.

34
00:06:28,803 --> 00:06:29,803
What’s with him?

35
00:06:36,602 --> 00:06:41,302
This isn’t fair. Everyone else seems
to trust me now. What is it with you?

36
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,340
Oh,
everyone trust you know?

37
00:06:43,447 --> 00:06:47,447
I was the first person to
trust you, remember? Back in Ba Sing Se.

38
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:51,421
And you turned around and
betrayed me. Betrayed all of us.

39
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,677
What can I do to make it up to you?

40
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,247
You really want to know?

41
00:06:55,464 --> 00:06:59,364
Hmm, maybe you could re-conquer
Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King.

42
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:02,465
Or, I know.
You could bring my mother back.

43
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,979
Opps, wrong tent.

44
00:07:13,394 --> 00:07:15,994
Sorry.
Do you need to talk to Sokka too?

45
00:07:16,147 --> 00:07:18,247
Nope. Not me.

46
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,610
Well, hellooo.

47
00:07:25,148 --> 00:07:29,148
Uh, Zuko. Yes, why would
I be expecting any one different?

48
00:07:31,346 --> 00:07:32,546
So what’s on your mind?

49
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:36,332
Your sister, she hates
me and I don’t know why!

50
00:07:36,518 --> 00:07:38,318
But I do care
what she thinks of me.

51
00:07:38,505 --> 00:07:42,005
Nah, she doesn’t hate you.
Katara doesn’t hate anyone.

52
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:44,406
Except maybe some
people in the Fire Nation.

53
00:07:45,457 --> 00:07:49,857
No, I mean, uh, not people who are
good but used to be bad. I mean, bad people.

54
00:07:50,022 --> 00:07:53,922
Fire Nation people who are so bad, who have
never been good and probably won’t be ever!

55
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:59,028
Stop. Okay, listen.
I know this may seem out of nowhere,

56
00:07:59,572 --> 00:08:01,572
but I want you to tell me
what happened to your Mother.

57
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:04,289
What?
Why would you want to know that?

58
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:08,224
Katara mentioned it before when
we were imprisoned together in Ba Sing Se...

59
00:08:08,261 --> 00:08:10,761
and again just now
when she was yelling at me.

60
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:16,506
I think somehow… she’s connected
her anger about that to her anger at me.

61
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:19,751
It’s not a day
I like to remember.

62
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,679
I’m going to find Mum.

63
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:43,692
Many of the warriors have seen the
black snow before and they knew what it meant.

64
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:45,217
A Fire Nation raid.

65
00:08:56,258 --> 00:09:00,358
We were badly outnumbered.
But somehow, we managed to drive them off.

66
00:09:04,188 --> 00:09:07,388
As quickly as they came,
they just left.

67
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,550
I was so relieved
when it was over but,

68
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,730
that’s because I didn’t
know yet what have happened.

69
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,050
I didn’t know
we lost our Mother.

70
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:22,768
Wait. Can you remember any details
about the soldiers who raided your village?

71
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:25,174
Like,
what the lead ship looked like?

72
00:09:25,546 --> 00:09:30,546
Yeah… Sea Ravens.
The main ship had flags with sea ravens on them.

73
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,740
The symbol of The Southern Raiders.
Thanks, Sokka.

74
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,841
No problem.
Thanks for stopping by.

75
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,578
Thought he never leave.

76
00:09:42,971 --> 00:09:43,971
Suki.

77
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:57,646
You look terrible.

78
00:09:58,421 --> 00:09:59,721
I waited out here all night.

79
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:01,079
What do you want?

80
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:04,949
I know who killed your Mother.
I’m going to help you find him.

81
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:16,201
I need to borrow Appa.

82
00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:19,905
Why? Is it your turn to
take a little fieldtrip with Zuko?

83
00:10:20,157 --> 00:10:21,657
Yes, it is.

84
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:25,148
Oh. What’s going on?

85
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:27,935
We’re going to find the
man who took my Mother from me.

86
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:33,354
Sokka told me the story of what happened.
I know who did it. And I know how to find him.

87
00:10:33,756 --> 00:10:36,956
Umm… and what exactly
do you think this would accomplish?

88
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:40,281
I knew you
wouldn’t understand.

89
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:46,027
Wait, stop, I do understand.
You’re feeling unbelievable pain and rage.

90
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:49,804
How do you think I felt about
the sandbenders when they stole Appa?

91
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:54,078
How do you think I felt about the Fire Nation
when I found out what happened to my people?

92
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:58,311
She needs this, Aang.
This is about getting closure and justice.

93
00:10:58,531 --> 00:11:01,431
I don’t think so.
I think it’s about getting revenge.

94
00:11:01,532 --> 00:11:06,532
Fine! Maybe it is. Maybe that’s what I need.
Maybe that’s what he deserves.

95
00:11:06,714 --> 00:11:09,214
Katara,
you sound like Jet.

96
00:11:09,363 --> 00:11:12,263
It’s not the same.
Jet attacked the innocent.

97
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:14,098
This man, he’s a monster.

98
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:18,335
Katara, she was my Mother too.
But I think Aang might be right.

99
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,850
Then you didn’t
love her the way I did.

100
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:22,351
Katara…

101
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:27,209
The monks used to say that
revenge is like a two-headed ratviper.

102
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,895
While you watch your enemy go down,
you’re being poisoned yourself.

103
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,620
That’s cute. But this isn’t
air temple pre-school. It’s the real World.

104
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:40,066
Now that I know he’s out there,
now that I know we could find him,

105
00:11:40,355 --> 00:11:41,655
I feel like I have no choice.

106
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:46,131
Katara, you do have a choice.
Forgiveness.

107
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:48,579
That’s the same as doing nothing.

108
00:11:48,695 --> 00:11:53,695
No it’s not. It’s easy to do nothing.
But it’s hard to forgive.

109
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:56,849
It’s not just hard,
it’s impossible.

110
00:12:07,703 --> 00:12:10,203
So you were just
going to take Appa anyway?

111
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,679
Yes.

112
00:12:11,978 --> 00:12:17,478
It’s okay, because I forgive you.
That give you any ideas?

113
00:12:17,855 --> 00:12:19,055
Don’t try to stop us.

114
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,938
I wasn’t planning to.
This is a journey you need to take.

115
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:24,907
You need to face this man.

116
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:30,269
But when you do,
please don’t choose revenge.

117
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:35,130
Let your anger out
and then let it go. Forgive him.

118
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:38,595
Okay, we’ll be sure
to do that guru-goody-goody.

119
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,041
Thanks for understanding Aang.
Yip yip.

120
00:12:44,002 --> 00:12:46,002
You know,
you’re pretty wise for a kid.

121
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,430
Thanks, Sokka.

122
00:12:47,631 --> 00:12:50,231
Usually it’s annoying but right now,
I’m just impressed.

123
00:12:50,432 --> 00:12:51,632
I appreciate that.

124
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:54,052
So…
can I borrow Momo for a week?

125
00:12:54,271 --> 00:12:55,271
Why do you need Momo?

126
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:02,225
We need to find the
Fire Navy communication tower.

127
00:13:02,726 --> 00:13:05,326
All the navy’s movements
are coordinated by messenger hawk.

128
00:13:05,677 --> 00:13:08,577
And every tower has to be
up to date on where everyone is deployed.

129
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:13,299
So once we find the communication tower,
we bust in and take the information we need.

130
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,820
Not exactly. We need to be
stealthy and make sure no one spots us.

131
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:22,384
Otherwise, they’ll warn The Southern Raiders.
Long before we reach them.

132
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,619
Okay, Southern Raiders.

133
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:55,466
There.
On patrol near Whale Tail Island.

134
00:13:56,194 --> 00:13:58,194
Whale Tail Island, here we come.

135
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:10,176
You should get some rest.
We’ll be there in a few hours.

136
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:11,801
You’ll need all your strength.

137
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,340
Now, don’t you worry
about my strength. I have plenty.

138
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:17,866
I’m not the helpless
little girl I was when they came.

139
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,730
I’m going to find Mum.

140
00:14:28,484 --> 00:14:29,484
Mum!

141
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:35,032
Katara’s Mum: Just let her go
and I’ll give you the information you want.

142
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:37,981
Fire Nation soldier:
You heard your Mother, get out of here!

143
00:14:38,214 --> 00:14:39,814
Mum, I’m scared.

144
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:42,721
Go find your Dad, sweetie.
I’ll handle this.

145
00:14:49,983 --> 00:14:51,683
I ran as fast as I could.

146
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,790
Dad! Dad! Please, I think Mum’s
in trouble! There’s a man in our house.

147
00:14:57,968 --> 00:14:58,968
Hakoda: Kya!

148
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:08,637
But, we were too late. When we got there,
the man was gone. And so was she.

149
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:11,526
Your Mother was a brave woman.

150
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:14,417
I know.

151
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:22,667
There! See those Sea Raven flags?

152
00:15:26,243 --> 00:15:28,043
It’s The Southern Raiders.

153
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:29,904
Let’s do this.

154
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:40,611
Soldier: So there I was and
I was like, you know, you could…

155
00:16:12,446 --> 00:16:15,446
This is it, Katara.
Are you ready to face him?

156
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:33,088
Captain:
Who are you?

157
00:16:33,251 --> 00:16:36,751
You don’t remember her?
You will soon. Trust me.

158
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:41,529
What?

159
00:16:44,284 --> 00:16:45,784
What’s happening to me?

160
00:16:52,353 --> 00:16:56,353
Think back. Think back to your
last raid on the Southern Water Tribe.

161
00:16:56,803 --> 00:17:00,303
I don’t know what you’re
talking about. Please, I don’t know!

162
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:05,644
Don’t lie! You look her in the eye and
you tell me you don’t remember what you did.

163
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:16,392
It’s not him.

164
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:20,981
He’s not the man.

165
00:17:21,234 --> 00:17:25,034
What?! What do you mean he’s not?
He’s a leader of The Southern Raiders!

166
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:26,599
He has to be the guy!

167
00:17:31,998 --> 00:17:34,898
If you’re not the man
we’re looking for, who is?

168
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:39,675
You must be looking for Yon Rha.
He retired 4 years ago.

169
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:55,027
Old Lady: Yon Rha,
you lazy piece of work, I need something.

170
00:17:55,564 --> 00:17:58,564
Yon Rha:
Yes Mother, what is it?

171
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:02,119
Yon Rha’s Mother: The tomato-carrot
from your garden are too hard for my gums.

172
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,473
I need something soft and juicy.

173
00:18:04,902 --> 00:18:09,102
Would you like something else
from the garden? I would be happy to…

174
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,589
Forget your stupid garden!

175
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,860
Get your grimy hind to the
market and buy me some real food!

176
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:33,842
Hello?
Did you see someone?

177
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:47,168
Hello? Is someone there?

178
00:18:50,121 --> 00:18:53,121
That was him.
That was the monster.

179
00:19:05,962 --> 00:19:08,562
Nobody sneaks up
on me without being burned.

180
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:30,959
We weren’t behind the bush.
And I wouldn’t try firebending again.

181
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:36,519
Whoever you are, take my money.
Take whatever you want, I’ll cooperate.

182
00:19:38,088 --> 00:19:39,588
Do you know who I am?

183
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:42,369
No, I’m not sure.

184
00:19:42,993 --> 00:19:47,493
Oh you better remember me like your life
depends on it! Why don’t you take a closer look.

185
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:55,107
Yes, yes. I remember you now.
You’re the little Water Tribe girl.

186
00:19:56,892 --> 00:19:59,892
Kya: Just let her go and I’ll
give you the information you want.

187
00:20:00,227 --> 00:20:02,727
Yon Rha: You heard your Mother,
get out of here!

188
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:04,834
Katara:
Mum, I’m scared.

189
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:08,066
Go find your Dad, sweetie.
I’ll handle this.

190
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:16,830
Now, tell me. Who is it?
Who’s the waterbender?

191
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:22,741
There are no waterbenders here.
The Fire Nation took them all away
 a long time ago.

192
00:20:22,863 --> 00:20:29,163
You’re lying. My source says there’s one
waterbender left in The Southern Water Tribe.

193
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:32,289
We’re not leaving until
we find the waterbender.

194
00:20:32,891 --> 00:20:36,591
If I tell you, do you promise
to leave the rest of the village alone?

195
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:42,385
It’s me.
Take me as your prisoner.

196
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:45,724
I’m afraid
I’m not taking prisoners today.

197
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:54,119
She lied to you.
She was protecting the last waterbender.

198
00:20:54,349 --> 00:20:56,249
What? Who?

199
00:20:57,405 --> 00:20:58,405
ME!

200
00:21:28,952 --> 00:21:32,652
I did a bad thing.
I know I did and you deserve revenge.

201
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,800
So why don’t you take my Mother?
That would be fair.

202
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:39,431
I always wonder what kind
of person could do such a thing.

203
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:42,813
But now that I see you,
I think I understand.

204
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:49,425
There’s just nothing inside you.
Nothing at all. You’re pathetic and sad and empty.

205
00:21:49,868 --> 00:21:51,368
Please spare me.

206
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:57,778
But as much as I hate you…
I just can’t do it.

207
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Katara! Are you okay?

208
00:22:28,286 --> 00:22:29,286
I’m doing fine.

209
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:36,612
Zuko told me what you did. Or…
what you didn’t do, I guess. I’m proud of you.

210
00:22:36,949 --> 00:22:42,249
I wanted to do it. I wanted to
take out all my anger at him but, I couldn’t.

211
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:47,842
I don’t know if it’s because I’m too weak
to do it or if it’s because I’m strong enough not to.

212
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:53,326
You did the right thing. Forgiveness is
the first step you have to take to begin healing.

213
00:22:55,255 --> 00:22:59,255
But I didn’t forgive him.
I’ll never forgive him.

214
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:03,256
But I am ready to forgive you.

215
00:23:10,218 --> 00:23:14,718
You were right about what
Katara needed. Violence wasn’t the answer.

216
00:23:15,036 --> 00:23:16,036
It never is.

217
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,560
Then I have a question for you.

218
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:22,966
What are you going
to do when you face my Father?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
