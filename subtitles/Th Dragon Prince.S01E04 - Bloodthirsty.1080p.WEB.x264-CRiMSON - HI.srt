[Viren] <i>Previously on</i>

5
00:00:21,508 --> 00:00:23,214
Boys!

6
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:27,040
You're going on a trip
to the Banther Lodge.

7
00:00:28,147 --> 00:00:30,644
- [growling]
- Aspiro.

8
00:00:31,977 --> 00:00:33,277
You just did magic.

9
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:35,917
- [Rayla] You're a mage.
- Wow!

10
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:37,854
I'm a mage!

11
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:41,923
[Viren] Moonshadow elves are dangerous,
elite fighters.

12
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,487
They will find you,
and they will kill you.

13
00:00:45,574 --> 00:00:46,779
It's up to us now.

14
00:00:46,858 --> 00:00:51,123
We have to return this egg
to keep it safe and carry it to Xadia.

15
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,426
And find its mother.

16
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:54,120
We could make a difference.

17
00:00:54,207 --> 00:00:55,472
Just the three of us.

18
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,518
- [grunts]
- [Callum] Four of us.

Unbind... thyself.

Don't judge me.

30
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:06,486
So what, I'm talking to my ribbon-thing?

31
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:09,638
How is that any worse than talking to a...

32
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:12,240
whatever it is you are?

[tolling continues]

A funeral so soon is madness.

38
00:03:13,513 --> 00:03:17,847
It is tradition to mourn fallen kings
for seven sunsets.

39
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:19,789
You've not even given him one.

40
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:23,061
I understand your concern, Opeli,

41
00:03:23,148 --> 00:03:27,104
but in a time of war,
we must move forward.

Hey, keep your head up.

Ugh, sorry.

45
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:50,670
[grunts] Long night.

46
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:53,214
[Claudia] Drink this.

47
00:03:53,595 --> 00:03:57,218
I call it "hot brown morning potion."

48
00:04:02,687 --> 00:04:05,184
[laughs] That's good!

[indistinct murmuring]

50
00:04:20,997 --> 00:04:24,497
Today we woke to a devastating truth.

51
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:26,748
Our king has been taken from us.

52
00:04:26,835 --> 00:04:27,857
[crowd gasping]

53
00:04:27,944 --> 00:04:33,671
Slain by the forces of Xadia,
vile Moonshadow elves.

54
00:04:35,595 --> 00:04:38,952
To me, he was more than a king.

55
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,264
In his final hours, Harrow called me...

56
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,349
his brother.

57
00:04:45,563 --> 00:04:47,058
[Opeli] Wait.

58
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:49,879
Where are the princes?

59
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:51,814
They need to be here.

60
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:54,317
The princes...

61
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,653
are dead.

62
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,011
[crowd exclaiming]

63
00:04:57,098 --> 00:05:00,510
We cannot let Xadia's cruelty
go unanswered.

64
00:05:00,597 --> 00:05:03,367
We must move forward with strength.

65
00:05:03,456 --> 00:05:05,202
Light the pyre.

66
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,711
No.

67
00:05:13,716 --> 00:05:16,672
[sighs] Claudia.

68
00:05:30,692 --> 00:05:32,694
[chanting]

69
00:05:50,753 --> 00:05:52,203
[crowd gasping]

70
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:57,405
When a ruler of Katolis dies,
we mourn for seven days.

71
00:05:57,492 --> 00:05:59,402
But we are at war.

72
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:03,010
Today, we must mourn sevenfold...

73
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:08,224
for tonight, there will be a coronation.

74
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:25,201
[Rayla] Callum. Callum. Hey!

75
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:27,576
That's your name, right? Callum?

76
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:30,996
- Clem? Or was it Camel?
- Uh, it's Callum.

77
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:35,026
I guess I was just distracted trying
to draw this... prima-ball.

78
00:06:35,113 --> 00:06:37,004
- Primal Stone.
- Right.

79
00:06:37,091 --> 00:06:39,864
It holds the pure essence
of a primal spirit inside.

80
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,760
- [sighs] Primal Source?
- Right.

81
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:45,119
You do know
what the Six Primal Sources are?

82
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:48,665
Uh, if I say yes,
are you gonna make me name them?

83
00:06:48,752 --> 00:06:50,140
[Rayla] Ugh.

84
00:06:52,357 --> 00:06:55,546
All magic in the world
comes from the Primal Sources.

85
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:59,384
They're the original and purest forms
of magical energy.

86
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:05,364
The Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Earth,
the Ocean, and...

87
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,910
- The Sky.
- Yes.

88
00:07:07,997 --> 00:07:11,330
To cast a spell,
a mage needs Primal Energy.

89
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:13,622
So that wind breath spell you did?

90
00:07:13,795 --> 00:07:17,042
You'd usually need a storm
or at least a strong breeze.

91
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:18,444
But with that stone,

92
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:22,175
you have all the power of the Sky,
any time.

93
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:25,553
- Wow.
- Primal Stones are incredibly rare.

94
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,872
They've been sought after by the most
powerful arch-mages in history.

95
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,142
And now, somehow you have one.

96
00:07:35,275 --> 00:07:38,566
Wait, I... I've seen these before.
At the Banther Lodge.

97
00:07:38,653 --> 00:07:42,635
There was this little cube thing
and it had these exact symbols on it.

98
00:07:42,722 --> 00:07:44,614
Uh, neat.

99
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:47,056
What if it's magic? We have to go get it.

100
00:07:47,143 --> 00:07:50,703
Wait, what?
We have real problems to worry about.

101
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,772
Ending the war.
Taking the dragon egg to Xadia. Remember?

102
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:59,146
Xadia's to the east, right?
So is the lodge. It's on the way.

103
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:02,947
Oh, great. I'm sure
it won't be crawling with humans.

104
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:07,201
Humans that are looking for you
and want to kill me! Yay!

105
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:12,056
No, it's the winter lodge.
It's been empty for months. Trust me.

106
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:16,101
[sighs] Look... Rayla.

107
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:19,339
Princes are supposed to be good at things.

108
00:08:19,426 --> 00:08:23,567
Uh, sword fighting, leadership...
riding horses.

109
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:27,388
But I've always been kind of bad at,
well, everything.

110
00:08:27,475 --> 00:08:29,599
So, when I tried that spell,

111
00:08:29,686 --> 00:08:33,811
I was sure I'd end up on fire
or covered in spiders...

112
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:35,412
but it worked.

113
00:08:36,044 --> 00:08:40,920
And then you called me a mage,
and that felt... right.

114
00:08:41,007 --> 00:08:45,297
I... I just have this feeling
that cube thing could help me.

115
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,215
[Ezran] Callum?

116
00:08:47,597 --> 00:08:48,765
[yawns]

117
00:08:49,515 --> 00:08:51,554
I had a weird dream.

118
00:08:52,226 --> 00:08:54,916
It wasn't a dream, Ez.
All of that was real.

119
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:56,477
Are you sure?

120
00:08:56,564 --> 00:09:01,524
There was this giant pink hippopotamus
and I pulled its ear off.

121
00:09:01,611 --> 00:09:03,174
Because it was made of taffy.

122
00:09:03,261 --> 00:09:05,444
Uh... no. That... that was a dream.

123
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:07,154
I thought you meant the elves,

124
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:09,722
the smoke wolves, the dragon egg.
That was all real.

125
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:12,575
Then I tried to thank the hippo
for the taffy,

126
00:09:12,662 --> 00:09:16,245
but he couldn't hear me,
because I was eating his ears.

127
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:18,247
[Rayla] Hey, sad prince.

128
00:09:19,087 --> 00:09:21,417
[sighs] Let's go get your cube.

129
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:23,194
- Really?
- [Rayla] Yes.

130
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:29,091
Just, please, no more detours, all right?
Or heartfelt speeches.

131
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:38,793
- Hey, guys? Can we...
- We're not stopping yet.

132
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,644
- But I'm...
- No snacks.

133
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,213
I was gonna say thirsty.

134
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,189
Fine. Drink this.

135
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:50,863
Uh, no, thank you. We don't drink... that.

136
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,533
- What?
- Blood.

137
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,991
We don't drink blood.

138
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:57,395
We don't mean to be rude,
but, uh, you can keep it.

139
00:09:57,482 --> 00:09:59,413
It's moonberry juice.

140
00:10:01,045 --> 00:10:02,255
[sniffs]

141
00:10:03,965 --> 00:10:07,989
[scoffs] Is that what humans think we are?
Bloodthirsty monsters?

142
00:10:08,076 --> 00:10:10,090
No, no, no. It... it's not that.

143
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:14,620
I mean, I... I have heard stories, but...
but I'm sure they're just stories.

144
00:10:14,707 --> 00:10:18,474
Horrible, awful stories.
Oh, look at that, we're here.

145
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:29,234
See? No winter,
no humans at the winter lodge.

146
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:30,905
Let's just make this quick.

147
00:10:30,992 --> 00:10:33,822
Tell me where the thing is,
and I'll be in and out.

148
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:40,579
Okay, so this is the game room.
Cube should be in there.

149
00:11:04,942 --> 00:11:08,359
Like I said, no winter, no humans. Right?

150
00:11:08,446 --> 00:11:12,236
Yeah, but it is kind of weird
there's no one here...

151
00:11:12,323 --> 00:11:15,197
since this is where Dad was sending us.

152
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:17,866
[horn sounding]

153
00:11:18,372 --> 00:11:19,745
[horses neighing]

154
00:11:19,832 --> 00:11:22,705
Yeah, we probably
shouldn't have come here.

155
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:50,441
Aunt Amaya?

156
00:11:53,157 --> 00:11:55,112
[Callum and Ezran groan]

157
00:11:57,453 --> 00:11:59,118
I'm so glad you're safe.

158
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:00,893
[stammers] Extremely safe!

159
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,704
Safe and... alone! [chuckles nervously]

160
00:12:15,012 --> 00:12:16,927
Oh, uh, that door's locked.

161
00:12:17,014 --> 00:12:20,848
So, uh, you wait here for a minute,
couple minutes, few...

162
00:12:20,935 --> 00:12:23,307
However long it takes. I'll go find a key.

163
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,230
I don't believe in locks.

164
00:12:36,826 --> 00:12:38,639
[Gren] Someone's here.

165
00:12:38,726 --> 00:12:41,784
What? No, no.

166
00:12:41,872 --> 00:12:45,329
No one here but us and all your
[shouting] human troops!

167
00:12:46,127 --> 00:12:49,041
Callum, you know it doesn't help to yell.

168
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,445
And why are you saying
"human troops" like that?

169
00:12:52,532 --> 00:12:53,964
Uh, what do you mean?

170
00:12:54,051 --> 00:12:57,533
That's how I always say
[shouting] "heavily-armed human troops!"

171
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,343
[laughs nervously]

172
00:13:17,616 --> 00:13:21,240
Uh, Ezran has something to tell you.

173
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:25,494
Um, I... skipped breakfast.

174
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,043
I'm sorry.

175
00:13:30,212 --> 00:13:34,127
[Gren] Breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

176
00:13:42,308 --> 00:13:44,080
[Gren] The food here is...

177
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:45,722
[bangs loudly]

178
00:13:46,228 --> 00:13:48,225
weapons-grade.

179
00:13:53,152 --> 00:13:54,195
Dig in.

180
00:13:56,322 --> 00:13:58,360
Aunt Amaya, why are you here?

181
00:13:59,116 --> 00:14:02,197
I received a messenger bird
from the king yesterday.

182
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:08,203
The most important things,
I've written down.

183
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:09,292
A letter?

184
00:14:11,295 --> 00:14:12,983
- [Gren] What's wrong?
- I just...

185
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,487
He gave me a letter, too,
but I must have dropped it somewhere.

186
00:14:16,574 --> 00:14:18,130
What'd your letter say?

187
00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:21,826
"General, the castle is under threat.

188
00:14:21,913 --> 00:14:25,888
Assassins have infiltrated the kingdom.
Moonshadow elves."

189
00:14:26,352 --> 00:14:27,648
The worst kind.

190
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:30,167
- "Do not bring your force to the castle."
- [Ezran grunts]

191
00:14:30,254 --> 00:14:33,129
"Your orders are to proceed immediately
to the Banther Lodge.

192
00:14:33,216 --> 00:14:38,108
Callum and Ezran will be there. Above all,
see to it that my sons are safe."

193
00:14:38,614 --> 00:14:41,278
Wait, there's more on the back.

194
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:46,867
"PS: Once their safety is assured,
the boys may wish to build a dirt man."

195
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,395
We do not wish to build a dirt man.

196
00:14:49,482 --> 00:14:50,876
We do not.

197
00:14:51,585 --> 00:14:53,749
You're safe now, boys.

198
00:14:55,756 --> 00:14:57,544
[crunching sharply]

199
00:15:10,938 --> 00:15:14,480
[sighs] This is all my fault.
We should have never come here.

200
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:17,923
But we found Aunt Amaya.
Maybe we should tell her, Callum.

201
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,258
Tell her what?

202
00:15:19,345 --> 00:15:22,029
About the egg... and Rayla.

203
00:15:22,116 --> 00:15:26,406
We can't. Didn't you hear what she said?
How she talked about elves?

204
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:28,452
To Aunt Amaya, elves are monsters.

205
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:30,853
- But if we just explain everything...
- [Bait vomits]

206
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,957
It won't work.
Humans and elves don't trust each other.

207
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:38,877
That won't change
until we take this egg back to Xadia.

208
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:42,089
We have to find Rayla and get out of here.

209
00:16:27,598 --> 00:16:29,662
[imitating Callum]
"It's the winter lodge, Rayla.

210
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:32,556
No winter, no humans." [scoffs]

211
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:38,150
[sighs]

212
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:40,647
"It's okay."

213
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,252
Huh.

214
00:17:00,422 --> 00:17:01,422
[gasps]

215
00:17:27,658 --> 00:17:29,363
[straining]

216
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:31,056
- [door opens]
- General Amaya!

217
00:17:31,143 --> 00:17:32,991
The princes have disappeared.

218
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,260
[groaning]

219
00:17:50,514 --> 00:17:52,010
[Gren] How did you do it?

220
00:17:52,975 --> 00:17:54,763
How did we do what?

221
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,250
"We"? How many of you are there?

222
00:17:58,337 --> 00:18:00,227
Did I say "we"?

223
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:02,004
[Gren] Don't look away from me.

224
00:18:02,091 --> 00:18:04,924
It's just me. I'm alone.

225
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:06,900
[Gren] Liar.

226
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:11,513
If there are more of them,
the princes are in danger.

227
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,615
Do not take your eyes off her.

228
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:21,375
[guard yelps]

229
00:18:21,462 --> 00:18:24,610
Careful with those.
Wouldn't want to lose a finger.

230
00:18:24,697 --> 00:18:28,922
I mean, can you imagine going through life
with only four fingers?

231
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,343
[faint rumbling]

232
00:18:34,016 --> 00:18:36,807
This is one of your weirdest ideas.

233
00:18:36,894 --> 00:18:38,666
Weirder than snail armor?

234
00:18:38,753 --> 00:18:41,019
Ez, snails already have armor.

235
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:44,004
- Then why do they keep getting smooshed?
- We're not... [grunts]

236
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:46,548
My point is,
I don't know if this plan'll work.

237
00:18:46,635 --> 00:18:48,024
She'll know what to do.

238
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:57,200
Have you met Bait?
Say hello to my little friend.

239
00:18:58,248 --> 00:18:59,500
[grunts]

240
00:19:12,221 --> 00:19:13,263
Thanks!

241
00:19:19,895 --> 00:19:20,980
[croaks]

242
00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:25,562
[Rayla] Come on!

243
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:45,707
[Gren] Stop right there, elf.
Callum, Ezran, come here.

244
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,921
Callum, we should just tell her.

245
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:53,381
Boys, get away from her.

246
00:19:56,682 --> 00:19:57,850
Wait!

247
00:20:04,273 --> 00:20:06,021
What are you saying?

248
00:20:06,108 --> 00:20:11,858
He says, if we don't let you go,
you'll kill them and drink their blood.

249
00:20:12,865 --> 00:20:15,445
That you are a monster.

250
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:20,158
Right, so you have to let us go.

251
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:24,329
[Gren] It's okay, Callum.
I've slain monsters before.

252
00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:25,997
Do it. Take her out.

253
00:20:27,838 --> 00:20:28,964
[grunts]

254
00:20:38,182 --> 00:20:41,096
Go ahead, take another shot.

255
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:44,184
But read my lips.

256
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:49,187
The next time I swing my blade,
I'll end both of them in half a second.

257
00:20:55,491 --> 00:20:58,071
- Move, humans.
- Ow!

258
00:20:59,953 --> 00:21:02,033
[unconvincingly] Ow...

259
00:21:05,751 --> 00:21:07,581
[Rayla] What now?

260
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:09,900
Ugh. I don't think a boat...

261
00:21:09,987 --> 00:21:11,668
[Callum] Just get in.

262
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:28,435
If the elf realizes we followed them,
she'll take the princes' lives.

263
00:21:28,607 --> 00:21:30,312
We need to be careful.

264
00:21:31,068 --> 00:21:32,194
Corvus!

265
00:21:35,405 --> 00:21:37,779
Track them, but stay out of sight.

266
00:21:37,866 --> 00:21:40,822
And when you see an opportunity,
free them.

267
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:44,951
The rest of you, ride with me.

268
00:21:54,716 --> 00:21:57,881
[sighs] That worked. I can't believe it.

269
00:21:58,178 --> 00:22:01,051
I can't believe you're such a jerk.

270
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,430
What? What's wrong?

271
00:22:03,517 --> 00:22:08,018
You called me a bloodthirsty monster.
You have no idea how that feels.

272
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:10,395
But I don't actually believe any of that.

273
00:22:10,482 --> 00:22:12,963
I was just trying to scare her.
I thought she'd back down.

274
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,441
Oh, that went well. They tried to kill me.

275
00:22:16,697 --> 00:22:19,511
I'm sorry.
That's not what I meant to happen.

276
00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:21,196
Well, it did.

277
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,265
[Callum] You found it?

278
00:22:23,352 --> 00:22:27,660
[Rayla] It's a toy.
Probably a piece from a children's game.

279
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:33,083
I hope it was worth it to you,
putting everyone's lives in danger.

280
00:22:48,854 --> 00:22:51,851
It's almost time, Father. Crown time.

281
00:22:51,982 --> 00:22:55,964
Or, as I like to call it, the Crown Hour.
Crown o'clock?

282
00:22:56,051 --> 00:22:58,983
[sighs] Thank you. That will be all.

283
00:23:04,328 --> 00:23:07,742
No song for the occasion? Hmm?

284
00:23:18,884 --> 00:23:24,326
People of Katolis,
King Harrow's death has wounded us deeply,

285
00:23:24,413 --> 00:23:30,350
but the loss of his sons, our princes,
is a greater injustice.

286
00:23:30,437 --> 00:23:32,918
By taking the heirs to the throne,

287
00:23:33,005 --> 00:23:36,731
our enemies sought to leave us
without a leader.

288
00:23:36,818 --> 00:23:41,760
It would disgrace Harrow's memory
to allow the kingdom he loved

289
00:23:41,847 --> 00:23:44,195
to be lost in darkness.

290
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:47,015
Though it is a heavy burden,

291
00:23:47,102 --> 00:23:51,786
I will humbly take up the battle
in Harrow's name.

292
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:56,749
I will become Lord Protector of the realm.

293
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:59,377
[indistinct chatter]

294
00:24:10,185 --> 00:24:11,680
[horn sounding]

295
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:13,641
[Gren] Stop!

296
00:24:15,148 --> 00:24:17,395
[horse whinnies]

297
00:24:17,716 --> 00:24:21,607
[Gren] Stop the coronation!
The princes are alive!

298
00:24:23,193 --> 00:24:25,825
