Air

5
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:13,413
Long ago,the four nations lived together in harmony

6
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:17,741
then everything changed when the firenation attacked

7
00:00:19,037 --> 00:00:22,687
Only the avatar mastered all four elements could stop them

8
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:25,767
but when the world needed him most he vanished

9
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:29,823
100 years passed, my brother and I discovered the new avatar

10
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,836
airbinder named Aang

11
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,336
And although his airbinding skill is great,

12
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:37,122
he has a lot to learn before he is ready to save anyone.

13
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:40,839
but I believe...
... Aang can save the world

27
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,770
Look, the inner wall.

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,100
I can't believe we finally made it to Ba Sing Se in one piece.

29
00:01:51,135 --> 00:01:52,305
Hey don't jinx it!

30
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,870
We could still be attacked by some giant, exploding Fire Nation spoon.

31
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:59,430
Or find out the city's been submerged in an ocean full of killer shrimp.

32
00:01:59,465 --> 00:02:01,630
You been hitting the cactus juice again?

33
00:02:01,665 --> 00:02:04,300
I'm just sayin', weird stuff happens to us.

34
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,330
Don't worry Aang, we'll find Appa.

35
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,865
It's such a big city.

36
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,450
He's a giant bison. Where could someone possibly hide him? Oh.

37
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,625
Back in the city. Great.

38
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,810
What's the problem? It's amazing!

39
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,655
Just a bunch of walls and rules.

40
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,510
You wait; you'll get sick of it in a couple of days.

41
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,420
I'm comin' for you buddy.

42
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,500
He's here. I can feel it.

43
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,325
Hello, my name is Joo Dee.

44
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,960
I have been given the great honor of showing the Avatar around Ba Sing Se.

45
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:20,155
And you must be Sokka, Katara, and Toph.

46
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,090
Welcome to our wonderful city. Shall we get started?

47
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:24,725
Yes!

48
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,070
We have information about the Fire Nation army that we need to deliver to the Earth King immediately.

49
00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:30,195
Great

50
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,655
let's begin our tour.

51
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,900
And then I'll show you to your new home here. I think you'll like it.

52
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,535
Maybe you missed what I said.

53
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,260
We need to talk to the King about the war, it's important.

54
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:46,690
You're in Ba Sing Se now. Everyone is safe here.

55
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,930
This is the lower ring.

56
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,990
What's that wall for?

57
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,455
Oh, Ba Sing Se has many walls.

58
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:03,050
There are the ones outside protecting us, and the one's inside that help maintain order.

59
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,760
This is where our newest arrivals live,

60
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,470
as well as our craftsman and artisans, people that work with their hands.

61
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:12,790
It's so quaint and lively.

62
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,835
You do want to watch your step though.

63
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,590
Why do they have all these poor people blocked off in one part of the city?

64
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,620
This is why I never came here before.

65
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,530
I always heard it was so different from the way the monks taught us to live.

66
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,320
I just want our new place to look nice ...

67
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:42,110
in case someone brings home a lady friend.

68
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,570
This city is a prison. I don't want to make a life here.

69
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:47,990
Life happens wherever you are,

70
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:49,715
whether you make it or not.

71
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,190
Now come on, I found us some new jobs,

72
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,420
and we start this afternoon.

73
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,970
Look at them, firebenders living right under everyone's nose.

74
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,415
Jet, you saw a man with a hot cup of tea.

75
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,675
It doesn't prove he's a firebender. And what if he is,

76
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,700
are we supposed to attack them? I thought we were starting over here,

77
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:13,970
...changing our ways.

78
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,345
We are,

79
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,030
when I get the evidence I need, I'll report them to the police and let them handle it.

80
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:20,483
Ok?

81
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,355
This is the middle ring of Ba Sing Se,

82
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,830
home to the financial district, shops and restaurants and the university.

83
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:32,635
Yeah, we met a Professor from Ba Sing Se University.

84
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,960
He took us to an ancient underground library where we discovered information about the war that is ...

85
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:38,650
absolutely crucial for the King to hear!

86
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:40,625
Isn't history fascinating?

87
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,735
Look, here's one of the oldest buildings in the middle ring, Town Hall.

88
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,865
Is that woman deaf?

89
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,950
She only seems to hear every other word I say.

90
00:05:49,985 --> 00:05:53,027
It's called "being handled". Get used to it.

91
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,850
Well, you certainly look like official tea servers.

92
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:06,140
How do you feel?

93
00:06:06,175 --> 00:06:07,240
Ridiculous.

94
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,400
Uh, Does this possibly come in a larger size?

95
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,930
I have extra string in the back. Have some tea while you wait.

96
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,480
Eeow! This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice!

97
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:27,790
Uncle, that's what all tea is.

98
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,110
How can a member of my own family say something so horrible?

99
00:06:33,145 --> 00:06:37,080
We'll have to make some major changes around here.

100
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,850
The Upper Ring is home to our most important citizens.

101
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:49,110
Your house is not too far from here.

102
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,750
What's inside that wall?

103
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,030
And who are the mean looking guys in robes?

104
00:07:00,065 --> 00:07:02,370
Inside is the Royal Palace.

105
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,731
Those men are agents of the Dai Li, the cultural authority of Ba Sing Se.

106
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:10,110
They are the guardians of all our traditions.

107
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,605
Can we see the King now?

108
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,030
Oh, no! One doesn't just pop in on the Earth King.

109
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,630
Here we are. Your new home.

110
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:30,440
More good news, your request for an audience with the Earth King is being processed,

111
00:07:30,475 --> 00:07:32,790
and should be put through in about a month.

112
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:34,880
Much more quickly than usual.

113
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,210
A month!

114
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,920
Six to eight weeks, actually.

115
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:50,090
Isn't it nice? I think you will really enjoy it here.

116
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,910
I think we'd enjoy it more if we weren't staying so long.

117
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:54,495
Can't we see the King any sooner?

118
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,580
The Earth King is very busy running the finest city in the world,

119
00:07:58,615 --> 00:08:01,045
but he will see you as soon as time permits.

120
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,860
If we are going to be here for a month, we should spend our time looking for Appa.

121
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:08,420
I'll be happy to escort you anywhere you would like to go.

122
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,290
We don't need a babysitter.

123
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,950
Oh, I won't get in the way. And to leave you alone would make me a bad host.

124
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:17,800
Where shall we start?

125
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,190
I'm sorry, but I haven't heard anything about a flying bison.

126
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:29,910
I didn't even know there were any.

127
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,350
If someone wanted to sell a stolen animal without anyone knowing, where would they go?

128
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,690
Where's the black market? Who runs it? Come on, you know!

129
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,630
That would be illegal.

130
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,070
You'll have to leave now. Your lemur is harassing my sparrowkeets.

131
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,480
I've never seen any sandbenders or nomads around here.

132
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,700
You should ask Professor Zei, he teaches the class on desert cultures.

133
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,990
Right. And which of your professors could we ask about the war with the fire nation?

134
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,670
I don't know. I'm not a political science student. I have to get to class. Ugh!

135
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,010
Well, I'm sorry no one has seen your bison.

136
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,280
Why don't you go get some rest? Someone will be over with dinner later.

137
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,940
Hey, come with me.

138
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:45,010
You're the Avatar. I heard you were in town. I'm Pao.

139
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:46,675
Nice to meet you, Pao.

140
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,500
So Pao, what's goin' on with this city? Why is everyone here so scared to talk about the war?

141
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,730
War? Scared? What do you mean?

142
00:09:54,765 --> 00:09:56,700
I can feel you shaking.

143
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:02,570
Look, I'm just a minor government official. I've waited 3 years to get this house.

144
00:10:02,605 --> 00:10:04,510
I don't want to get into trouble.

145
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,140
Get in trouble with who?

146
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:13,440
listen, you can't mention the war here, and whatever you do, stay away from the Dai Li.

147
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,005
Would you like a pot of tea?

148
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,780
We've been working in a tea shop all day.

149
00:10:24,815 --> 00:10:26,490
I'm sick of tea!

150
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,100
Sick of tea? That's like being sick of breathing!

151
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,140
Have you seen our spark rocks to heat up the water?

152
00:10:36,175 --> 00:10:37,480
They're not there.

153
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,910
You'll have to firebend, old man.

154
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,700
Where are you going?

155
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,600
I borrowed our neighbors, such kind people.

156
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,145
I've got it! I know how we're gonna see the Earth King!

157
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,550
How are we supposed to do that?
"One doesn't just pop in on the Earth King"

158
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,300
The King is having a party at the palace tonight for his pet bear.

159
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,280
You mean Platypus-Bear?

160
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:20,515
No, it just says "Bear".

161
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,070
Certainly you mean his pet Skunk-Bear.

162
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:24,380
Or his Armadillo-Bear.

163
00:11:24,415 --> 00:11:25,550
Gopher-Bear?

164
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,010
Just..."Bear"

165
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,745
This place is weird.

166
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,250
The palace will be packed. We can sneak in with the crowd.

167
00:11:34,285 --> 00:11:35,250
Won't work.

168
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,175
Why not?

169
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,265
Well, no offense to you simple country folk,

170
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,730
but a real society crowd would spot you from a mile away.

171
00:11:41,765 --> 00:11:43,490
You've got no manners.

172
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:49,560
Excuse me? I've got no manners? You're not exactly lady fancy fingers.

173
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,890
I learned proper society behavior and chose to leave it.

174
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:59,230
You never learned anything. And frankly, it's a little too late.

175
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,200
Ah-Ha, but you learned it. You could teach us.

176
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,770
Yeah, I'm mastering every element. How hard could manners be?

177
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,890
Good evening, Mr. Sokka Watertribe.

178
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:10,580
Ms. Katara Watertribe.

179
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,180
Lord Momo of the Momo Dynasty, your Momo-ness.

180
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,740
Avatar Aang, how you do go on?

181
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,910
Katara might be able to pull it off, but you two would be lucky to pass as busboys.

182
00:12:28,945 --> 00:12:30,950
But I feel so fancy.

183
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:35,950
-Earth!
-Fire!

184
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,720
Wow, you look beautiful.

185
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,095
Don't talk to the commoners, Katara. First rule of society.

186
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:57,140
We'll get in the party, and then find a way to let you in through the side gate.

187
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,000
Jet, we need to talk.

188
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:18,940
What? Oh great, it's you guys. Where have you been? I could use some help with surveillance here.

189
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,730
We've been talking, and we think you're becoming obsessed with this.

190
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,395
It's not healthy.

191
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,065
Oh, really? You both think this?

192
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,385
We came here to make a fresh start,

193
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,650
but you won't let this go. Even though there's no real proof!

194
00:13:33,685 --> 00:13:35,732
Well, maybe if you'd help me.

195
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:37,745
Jet, you've gotta stop this.

196
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,495
Maybe you've forgotten why we need to start over.

197
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,210
Maybe you've forgotten about how the Fire Nation left us all homeless?

198
00:13:43,245 --> 00:13:45,695
How they wiped out all the people we loved.

199
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,940
If you don't want to help me, I'll get the evidence on my own.

200
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,140
This is the best tea in the city!

201
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:01,920
The secret ingredient is love.

202
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,380
I think you're due for a raise.

203
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,710
I'm tired of waiting. These two men are firebenders!

204
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,360
I know they're firebenders! I saw the old man heating his tea!

205
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,420
He works in a tea shop.

206
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,685
He's a firebender, I'm telling you!

207
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,405
Drop your swords boy, nice and easy.

208
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:42,840
You'll have to defend yourself. Then everyone will know. Go ahead, show them what you can do.

209
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,520
You want a show? I'll give you a show.

210
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,090
Invitation please.

211
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,660
I think this will do.

212
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,870
No entry without an invitation.

213
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,615
Step out of line please.

214
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:18,910
Look, the Pangs and the Yum Soon Hans are waiting in there for us.

215
00:15:18,945 --> 00:15:21,520
I'm going to have to tell them who didn't let me in.

216
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:23,480
Step out of line please.

217
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:38,210
Sir? I'm sorry to bother you, but my cousin lost our invitations.

218
00:15:38,245 --> 00:15:39,845
She's blind.

219
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,665
Do you think you could help us?

220
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,660
Our family's inside and I'm sure they're very worried.

221
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,765
I am honored,

222
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,650
please come with me.

223
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,895
He's taking all the good stuff!

224
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,180
Quiet, you don't know what I had to do to get seats this near the bear!

225
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,935
It's beautiful, isn't it?

226
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:18,679
By the way, I'm Long Feng. I'm a cultural minister to the king.

227
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:22,420
I'm Kwa mai, and this is Dung.

228
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,910
Now where is your family? I'd love to meet them.

229
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:32,290
Um, I don't see 'em right now. But I'm sure we'll find them soon. Thanks for all your help.

230
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,740
Don't worry, as your escort it would be dishonorable to abandon you ladies without finding your families first.

231
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,430
We'll keep looking.

232
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,455
Where are they?

233
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,045
Look, I came up with a backup plan.

234
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,565
We dress Momo like a ghost, OK?

235
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,450
He flies by the guards creating a distraction, then we blast a hole in the wall...

236
00:16:58,485 --> 00:16:59,995
Or, we could go in with these guys.

237
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,855
Toph said we might pass as busboys.

238
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:07,290
OK, but remember that Momo ghost plan. I think it's a winner.

239
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,160
You must be getting tired of using those swords.

240
00:17:14,195 --> 00:17:16,640
Why don't you go ahead and firebend at me.

241
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:21,304
Please son, you're confused. You don't know what you're doing!

242
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:24,988
Bet you wish he'd help you out with a little fire blast right now.

243
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:29,124
You're the one who needs help.

244
00:17:38,238 --> 00:17:40,870
You see that? The Fire nation is trying to silence me.

245
00:17:41,556 --> 00:17:42,895
It'll never happen.

246
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,070
Where are Toph and Katara?

247
00:17:50,105 --> 00:17:53,355
Forget about them, just keep an eye out for the King.

248
00:17:54,435 --> 00:17:55,861
I don't know what he looks like.

249
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,107
You know, "royal", flowing robe, fancy jewelry.

250
00:18:01,606 --> 00:18:02,967
That could be anyone.

251
00:18:04,069 --> 00:18:05,743
Another crab puff please.

252
00:18:05,778 --> 00:18:06,702
You found us.

253
00:18:07,901 --> 00:18:10,405
I'd know your little footsteps anywhere Twinkletoes.

254
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,343
Thanks for letting us in.

255
00:18:12,437 --> 00:18:15,897
Sorry, but the guy who escorted us in, won't let us out of his sight.

256
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:17,153
What guy?

257
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,072
What are you doing here?

258
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:23,846
You have to leave immediately, or we'll all be in terrible trouble.

259
00:18:23,846 --> 00:18:26,063
Not until we see the King.

260
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:30,050
You don't understand. You must go.

261
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,520
Sorry! No, don't shout.

262
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:45,310
The Avatar. Ooh, I didn't known the Avatar would be here.

263
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,510
You keep their attention while I look for the King.

264
00:18:56,545 --> 00:18:58,054
Watch this everybody!

265
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,420
Drop your weapons!

266
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,235
Arrest them. They're Firebenders.

267
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:31,370
This poor boy is confused. We're just simple refugees.

268
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:36,470
This young man wrecked my tea shop, and assaulted my employees.

269
00:19:36,505 --> 00:19:38,930
It's true sir. We saw the whole thing.

270
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,670
This crazy kid attacked the finest tea maker in the city.

271
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,660
Oh ho ho. That's very sweet.

272
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,450
Come with us son.

273
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:56,030
You don't understand! They're Fire Nation! You have to believe me!

274
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,070
Aang, the Earth King.

275
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,700
Greetings your majesty.

276
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,220
Hey, let me go.

277
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:03,518
Avatar, it is a great honor to meet you. I am Long Feng, Grand Secretary of Ba Sing Se and head of the Dai Li.

278
00:21:03,518 --> 00:21:07,617
I'd like to talk to you. You're friends will be waiting for us in the library.

279
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,265
Why won't you let us talk to the King?

280
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,054
We have information that could defeat the Fire Nation!

281
00:21:17,054 --> 00:21:20,720
The Earth King has no time to get involved with political squabbles ...

282
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:23,500
and the day to day minutia of military activities.

283
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,325
This could be the most important thing he has ever heard.

284
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:32,630
What's most important to his royal majesty is maintaining the cultural heritage of Ba Sing Se.

285
00:21:32,665 --> 00:21:35,735
All his duties relate to issuing decrees on such matters.

286
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:41,280
It's my job to oversee the rest of the city's resources, including the military.

287
00:21:41,315 --> 00:21:43,570
So the King is just a figurehead.

288
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:45,195
He's your puppet!

289
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:50,515
Oh, no, no! His majesty is an icon, a god to his people.

290
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,300
He can't sully his hands with the hourly change of an endless war.

291
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,881
But we found out about a solar eclipse that will leave the Fire Nation defenseless.

292
00:21:57,881 --> 00:21:59,285
You could lead an invasion...

293
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:01,870
Enough, I don't want to hear your ridiculous plan!

294
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:04,675
It is the strict policy of Ba Sing Se...

295
00:22:04,675 --> 00:22:07,670
that the war not be mentioned within the walls.

296
00:22:07,705 --> 00:22:12,870
Constant news of an escalating war will throw the citizens of Ba Sing Se into a state of panic.

297
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,915
You have to believe me, they're firebenders!

298
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,230
They won't stop until they win the war.

299
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,330
Calm down, you're safe now.

300
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:30,460
Our economy would be ruined. Our peaceful way of life, our traditions would disappear.

301
00:22:30,495 --> 00:22:33,965
There's no war in Ba Sing Se.

302
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,720
What are you talking about? Where do you think all the refugees come from? You can't hide it.

303
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:44,910
In silencing talk of conflict, Ba Sing Se remains a peaceful, orderly utopia.

304
00:22:44,945 --> 00:22:47,270
The last one on Earth.

305
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,860
There is no war within the walls. Here we are safe.

306
00:22:54,895 --> 00:22:58,060
Here we are free.

307
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:03,070
You can't keep the truth from all these people. They have to know.

308
00:23:03,105 --> 00:23:06,375
I'll tell them. I'll make sure everyone knows!

309
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,315
Until now, you've been treated as our honored guest.

310
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,195
But from now on, you will be watched every moment by Dai Li agents.

311
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:17,270
If you mention the war to anyone, you will be expelled from the city.

312
00:23:17,305 --> 00:23:19,775

It would be quite a shame if you were not able to complete your quest.

314
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:27,180
Now Joo Dee will show you home.

00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,570
Come with me, please.

316
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:32,990
What happened to Joo Dee?

317
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,500
I'm Joo Dee. I'll be your host as long as you're in our wonderful city.
