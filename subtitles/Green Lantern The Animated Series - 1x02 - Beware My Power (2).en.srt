1
00:00:05,263 --> 00:00:06,715
<i>Previously on Green Lantern...</i>

2
00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:10,560
There are Lanterns dying out there!

3
00:00:10,616 --> 00:00:14,317
We need to get out there and stop
who ever is targeting them. Now!

4
00:00:18,348 --> 00:00:21,348
<b>1x02 - Beware My Power, part 2</b>

5
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:26,884
<i>Hal Jordan of Earth, soon to be
former Green Lantern of sector 2814.</i>

6
00:00:27,114 --> 00:00:29,458
<i>You are now charged with
treason, grand theft and...</i>

7
00:00:29,578 --> 00:00:32,671
Let's postpone my lynching until
I tell you a couple of things.

8
00:00:33,082 --> 00:00:34,766
You see these handsome devils?

9
00:00:34,886 --> 00:00:39,082
They're the Lantern killers you said didn't exist.
Call themselves Red Lanterns.

10
00:00:39,202 --> 00:00:40,141
Ring any bells?

11
00:00:40,403 --> 00:00:42,755
<i>Red Lanterns, are you sure?</i>

12
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:46,506
<i>He has concocted this ruse to save himself
from a deserved punishment.</i>

13
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:50,939
Respectfully, sir. I got an aching jaw
that says they ain't no ruse.

14
00:00:51,226 --> 00:00:53,696
Their Power Rings fire
some sort of red energy tha-

15
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,360
<i>They have rings?!
Powered by what?</i>

16
00:00:56,703 --> 00:00:59,582
Best guess... a huge desire to
mash us all into pulp.

17
00:01:02,669 --> 00:01:07,371
I say we high tail it back to Oa, cram the
interceptor with as many GLs as she'll hold...

18
00:01:07,491 --> 00:01:10,916
...ultra-warp back and kick their red butts
until they're black and blue!

19
00:01:11,178 --> 00:01:15,002
<i>Despite the colorful terminology,
a logical course of action.</i>

20
00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:19,299
<i>Sensors have picked up an unmanned
probe sweeping the area.</i>

21
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:22,719
<i>Markings match the insignia of the
recently encountered hostiles.</i>

22
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:26,712
Right. Red Lanterns.
Aya, plot intercept course. It's go time.

23
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:29,624
<i>Hal Jordan of Earth,
do not terminate this communication..!</i>

24
00:01:29,987 --> 00:01:32,166
Sorry, gotta take this,
don't be a stranger.

25
00:01:37,522 --> 00:01:40,554
This threat may turn out to be nothing
more than a few extremists.

26
00:01:40,816 --> 00:01:42,452
If the truth does come out...

27
00:01:42,572 --> 00:01:45,892
...many will wonder why it isn't recorded
in the book of Oa.

28
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:50,943
Because Sayd, the history is written,
or unwritten, by the victors.

29
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:56,094
Forget about snaring it, just blast it!

30
00:02:00,464 --> 00:02:02,553
<i>Warning! Shield degrading.</i>

31
00:02:08,717 --> 00:02:10,760
Hal, break off!
Stick to the plan.

32
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:13,030
We go for reinforcements, then come back!

33
00:02:13,136 --> 00:02:15,746
We can't let this thing give away our position!

34
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:17,657
What position?!
We're going home!

35
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,065
The Red Lanterns cought you with your pants
down back on that rock and you want payback!

36
00:02:25,902 --> 00:02:29,520
<i>Direct hit to port ampoules.
Shield's degrading to critical.</i>

37
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,943
<i>Please do not let that happen again.</i>

38
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,708
Get ready to fire when I clear that rock.

39
00:02:46,422 --> 00:02:47,684
Peekaboo.

40
00:02:52,412 --> 00:02:53,880
Happy?

41
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:55,860
That felt good!

42
00:02:56,235 --> 00:03:01,054
A probe tlike that means the Red Lanterns are
more than two killers with rings and a symbol.

43
00:03:01,243 --> 00:03:02,605
They're organized.

44
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,468
Yeah...
Looks like we can't hog all the fun.

45
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:07,766
Let's hit HQ and load up
the boys like we planned.

46
00:03:07,924 --> 00:03:09,471
Aya, take us home.

47
00:03:09,683 --> 00:03:11,174
<i>Arching ultra-warp drives.</i>

48
00:03:11,314 --> 00:03:15,561
<i>Ready in three... two... one...
Impel.</i>

49
00:03:22,972 --> 00:03:24,891
Are we there yet?

50
00:03:25,195 --> 00:03:26,535
Aya, what happened?

51
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,680
<i>Overload due to hairline crack
in the ultra-warp coil.</i>

52
00:03:29,855 --> 00:03:33,219
<i>Most likely caused by last
missile hit by enemy probe.</i>

53
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,366
For the record, she said most likely...
Not totally likely.

54
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:40,394
- What does that mean?
- It means we're gonna be a little late to Oa.

55
00:03:40,537 --> 00:03:44,496
That's okay, I like to make an entrance.
Aya, please estimate time for repairs.

56
00:03:44,603 --> 00:03:45,853
<i>Calculating.</i>

57
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,422
- Ultra-warp ready in nine point two...
- Nine minutes, no problem!

58
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:51,603
<i>Nine point two one months.</i>

59
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:54,848
Okay...

60
00:03:55,047 --> 00:03:58,157
Can we form a construct and replace
the defective part for the ride home?

61
00:03:58,287 --> 00:04:02,253
<i>The construct would have to be an exact
copy of the ultra-warp coil mechanism.</i>

62
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:07,273
<i>And it's 56 moving parts to within
a 0.8162 microns tolerance.</i>

63
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:10,718
Can either of you do that?

64
00:04:11,147 --> 00:04:14,096
- I make hammers.
- Look, maybe it's for the best...

65
00:04:14,263 --> 00:04:16,095
The Guardians won't deal
with the problem like we will.

66
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:18,274
We'll make those Red Lanterns pay.

67
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:23,415
Is he all right?

68
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:25,525
Just... a little light headed...

69
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:27,175
He's taken a beating.

70
00:04:27,282 --> 00:04:32,069
He needs a real doctor, he's not making
nine hours, never mind nine months!

71
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:35,079
I was kinda looking forward to seeing Oa.

72
00:04:36,582 --> 00:04:41,089
Aya, scan for the nearest inhabited world.
Preferably one with a hospital.

73
00:04:41,174 --> 00:04:44,470
Don't bother...
I know my own sector anywhere.

74
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:47,194
We're not far from my home colony.

75
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:50,873
Sounds like a good place to lay low
for a while and get you fixed up.

76
00:05:13,974 --> 00:05:18,755
You had three Green Lanterns
in your grasp, and let them escape?!

77
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:23,168
Perhaps you're not wholly committed
to our righteous crusade.

78
00:05:23,288 --> 00:05:29,561
I live to serve the mighty Atrocitus,
your will is the core of my very being.

79
00:05:29,823 --> 00:05:32,503
What good is that to me Zilius Zox...

80
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:37,235
... if you're not competent to kill
a mere three Green Lanterns?

81
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:42,907
It was this child's fault! He's been
promoted too quickly, and on false grounds!

82
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:47,387
He pitied them!
The destroyers of our system!

83
00:05:47,507 --> 00:05:49,748
What do you have to say for yourself Razer?

84
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,908
Zox lies. But these Lanterns were
different from those we eliminated before.

85
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,172
Tougher... Better trained...

86
00:05:57,813 --> 00:05:59,673
How could they know already?

87
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,964
- Who my lord?
- The Guardians of Oa!

88
00:06:03,084 --> 00:06:08,350
If they've sent reinforcements then
your failure may jeopardize my plans!

89
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:10,775
No!
They must be destroyed!

90
00:06:10,895 --> 00:06:14,546
They must die for Shard,
all for you and Shard, master!

91
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,601
That's right Zilius.
Shard is sacred ground.

92
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:21,431
A piece of the remains of
our world which

93
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:25,090
the Guardians attempted to
erase from the universe.

94
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:29,515
They did not succeed then,
and will not today!

95
00:06:31,393 --> 00:06:32,215
Look.

96
00:06:34,781 --> 00:06:38,921
It seems one of my hunter killer drones
found the Green Lantens.

97
00:06:42,812 --> 00:06:46,941
Your "hunter killer drone" isn't
much on the killer part, is it?

98
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:48,992
The done's attack was a feint.

99
00:06:49,112 --> 00:06:53,255
It's actual goal was to plant a tracker
which will lead us to them.

100
00:06:54,049 --> 00:06:58,469
And then we'll draw out these
Guardian lapdogs and destroy them.

101
00:06:58,928 --> 00:07:01,004
Wherever they may hide.

102
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,405
Don't be such a baby.

103
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:12,547
Very handy to have a doctor for a wife.

104
00:07:13,078 --> 00:07:16,136
Medicine is something I picked up
because of my husband's second job.

105
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,778
She's actually the colony's head geologist.

106
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:20,682
I was an engineer, that was how we met.

107
00:07:20,802 --> 00:07:24,698
Beata's the genius who dreamed up
using the volcanoes lava for thermal power.

108
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:27,551
So was that your secret identity,
engineer?

109
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:29,105
Secret what?

110
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:34,163
That's Hal's hang-up,
that thing on his face, it's a mask.

111
00:07:34,283 --> 00:07:36,531
He wears it in case
some earthling sneaks

112
00:07:36,532 --> 00:07:39,472
into the interceptor,
while in space mind you and goes:

113
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:44,033
Aha! The Green Lantern on my
planet is Hal Jordan! I'm telling everyone!

114
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:52,896
Haha... Talk to me when your planets invents
paparazzi and the 24-hour news cycle.

115
00:07:53,427 --> 00:07:54,247
<i>Daddy!</i>

116
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:57,661
Wait... Who is this giant?

117
00:07:58,069 --> 00:07:59,967
What have you done with
my daughter Amala?

118
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:02,260
I am Amala!

119
00:08:03,193 --> 00:08:06,617
Now, now... Time for hugs later.
Let daddy rest.

120
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,722
Bye daddy!

121
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:18,947
This is some place...
Kinda reminds me of where I grew up...

122
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:20,445
Bolovax Vik.

123
00:08:21,146 --> 00:08:24,445
I'm sorry.
Even here we heard about it's destruction.

124
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:30,410
Your planet was destroyed?
I-I never knew... how did...

125
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:33,618
Just concentrate on gettin' us out of
this mess you made hotshot.

126
00:08:33,738 --> 00:08:34,546
<i>Attention!</i>

127
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:37,215
<i>I have found a tracking device
on the interceptor's hull...</i>

128
00:08:37,477 --> 00:08:39,481
<i>... and require assistance removing it.</i>

129
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,191
Do you think they..?

130
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:50,647
Yeah.
Pretty sure they do.

131
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:06,094
<i>Whoa!
What is it?</i>

132
00:09:10,622 --> 00:09:15,042
<i>This colony know enjoys the protection
of the Red Lantern Corps.</i>

133
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,298
<i>You have been liberated from
the tyranny of the Guardians.</i>

134
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,967
<i>But their Green Lantern
lackeys are here...</i>

135
00:09:21,281 --> 00:09:25,670
<i>You have one solar hour to
bring these war criminals to us...</i>

136
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:28,830
<i>... or your planet will be vaporized.</i>

137
00:09:37,148 --> 00:09:38,651
Those murdering red...

138
00:09:38,771 --> 00:09:40,528
We have to turn ourselves over to them.

139
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,759
Shyir, no!

140
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:44,885
- We don't have a choice!
- These guys are murderers.

141
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:47,285
They're gonna blow up this rock
no matter what you do!

142
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:48,938
We do have a choice.

143
00:09:49,058 --> 00:09:52,791
We can fight them. And keep fighting,
until we can't fight anymore.

144
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:56,723
That thing is a fortress.
A frontal attack would be suicide.

145
00:09:56,843 --> 00:09:58,770
Hey, if you've got
another way, I'm all ears,

146
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:00,698
but we've got to take that thing out!

147
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:03,111
The Earth-Man is right, we must go!

148
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,860
Shyir, wait!

149
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,388
I have another way!

150
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:24,739
Time's up! Shall I initiate
the countdown to detonation?

151
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:27,418
No. Razer will do it.

152
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:33,832
Atrocitus, our cause is right and just...
But, to kill innocents...

153
00:10:34,197 --> 00:10:38,159
As I told you master, he's weak!
Weak...

154
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:42,465
The Guardians and their lapdogs
destroyed my homeworld.

155
00:10:42,801 --> 00:10:45,960
And Zilius's.
And countless others.

156
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:51,474
By making an example of these disloyal few,
we save millions later.

157
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:56,331
Show weakness now and
you doom our people forever.

158
00:10:56,825 --> 00:11:00,272
I am not weak.
I am not a coward.

159
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:04,487
For the greater good.
And vengence!

160
00:11:04,986 --> 00:11:07,323
<i>Countdown sequence initiated.</i>

161
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:11,077
<i>You have five minutes to get
to minimum safe orbital distance.</i>

162
00:11:13,654 --> 00:11:14,737
Knock, knock!

163
00:11:15,802 --> 00:11:17,055
Anybody home?!

164
00:11:17,998 --> 00:11:19,107
Zox, come!

165
00:11:22,546 --> 00:11:25,056
Razer, stay and guard the device.

166
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:27,375
If attacked, do your duty.

167
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,521
Soon your ring will be
all that's left of you Lantern!

168
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:42,127
Settle down, demented beach ball.

169
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:57,504
I am Atrocitus.
Lord and master of the Red Lantern Corps.

170
00:11:57,624 --> 00:12:01,961
I am the one who will destroy
the Guardians and all they stand for.

171
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:06,467
I am wrath!
I am hate!

172
00:12:06,952 --> 00:12:09,344
I am righteous vengeance!

173
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:19,938
According to Beata's map,
we're right under it.

174
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:23,274
Boy, I hope she is right about this.
I'm bakin' here!

175
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:24,940
She's always right.

176
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,412
This way!

177
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,826
That must be the controlpanel.
You think you can disarm it Rev?

178
00:12:39,803 --> 00:12:41,463
I'll need a few minute-...

179
00:12:55,763 --> 00:12:57,279
Die, die, die!

180
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:16,283
Hurry up, Rev!

181
00:13:19,455 --> 00:13:20,856
This guy's not playing around!

182
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:23,664
Keep him back,
for just a couple of minutes.

183
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:25,461
This is your fault!

184
00:13:25,726 --> 00:13:29,382
You Green Lanterns might
enjoy destroying worlds. But I do not!

185
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:35,590
I case you haven't been
keeping up on current events...

186
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,349
... you guys put this thing here,
and pressed the button!

187
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,518
You wanna help!?
Stop fighting us!

188
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,550
I won't listen to your lies.
I'll destroy you both!

189
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,465
And what, you gonna mass murder
them by blowing up the planet!?

190
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:55,359
You know what you're fighting againts, kid.
But what are you fighting for?!

191
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,089
Dumb kid...

192
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,592
Where are Shyir?
Lets have some good news!

193
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:15,542
<i>Detonation in thirty seconds.</i>

194
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:27,828
This is disappointing.

195
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:32,974
If you're the best the Guardians have,
my victory is assured!

196
00:14:40,135 --> 00:14:42,847
Master, the bomb is active.
We need to move away.

197
00:14:53,703 --> 00:14:54,556
<i>Three...</i>

198
00:14:54,849 --> 00:14:55,569
<i>Two...</i>

199
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:56,595
<i>One.</i>

200
00:14:58,685 --> 00:15:00,596
<i>Detonate. Detonate.</i>

201
00:15:02,163 --> 00:15:03,245
Time to go.

202
00:15:03,365 --> 00:15:07,254
I can keep the laser from igniting
the plutonium, for a little while anyway.

203
00:15:08,134 --> 00:15:10,185
I know what happened to Bolovax Vik.

204
00:15:10,465 --> 00:15:14,433
If you had a chance to save your world...
What would you do?

205
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,353
It's been an honor.

206
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:38,004
It's foolish to stay when there's
no hope, Green Lantern.

207
00:15:38,513 --> 00:15:42,717
Yeah... we're dumb that way.
But there's always hope.

208
00:15:43,395 --> 00:15:47,984
I know you're not all bad.
Maybe it's time you let others know too.

209
00:15:50,444 --> 00:15:54,546
Best get going, son.
I can handle this last part myself.

210
00:16:27,483 --> 00:16:29,913
It appears you were wrong about Razer.

211
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:32,832
Never have I been so happy to be wrong.

212
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:36,812
I'll have the choir scream his
praises at the Rage ceremony.

213
00:16:36,932 --> 00:16:40,140
Now that we've eliminated
the Lanterns from Oa...

214
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,975
soon this galaxy will be ours
for the taking.

215
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:47,849
And then the Guardians will pay
for what they've done!

216
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:06,713
Kilowog? Rev?

217
00:17:12,755 --> 00:17:14,692
They aren't here anymore.

218
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:26,545
Is that the best you can do?!
You think that will stop me?!

219
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:51,661
You won't will unless you can
do what is necessary.

220
00:17:51,923 --> 00:17:54,051
Can you do it?
Can you?!

221
00:17:59,189 --> 00:18:00,295
Finish it.

222
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,488
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

223
00:18:10,984 --> 00:18:13,012
But you're not getting of that easy.

224
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:15,777
You'll live with the consequences
of what you've done.

225
00:18:15,897 --> 00:18:17,753
No! You must kill me!

226
00:18:18,074 --> 00:18:20,772
I'm the one responsible for all
this death and destruction.

227
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:21,983
I deserve it!

228
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,903
Which is why you're going
to help make up for it.

229
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:32,572
Coward...
Are you too weak to take your vengance?

230
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,272
Don't... push it...

231
00:18:47,572 --> 00:18:50,184
- You ganna help me with this, hotshot?
- Kilowog!

232
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:54,618
I got most of the colonists up before
the big bang, but my ring is running low.

233
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:56,726
<i>I believe I can help.</i>

234
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,954
What's he doing inside that bubble?

235
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:15,662
Never mind him.
You are a sight for sore eyes. You too, Aya.

236
00:19:16,294 --> 00:19:18,103
<i>Thank you.</i>

237
00:19:18,104 --> 00:19:20,912
What about Rev.
Did he make it?

238
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:34,919
I hope everyone knows the sacrifice
Shyir made.

239
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,851
They do. The elders are going
to name our new planet after him.

240
00:19:43,826 --> 00:19:47,360
Your daddy was very brave, Amala.
He saved us all.

241
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:51,004
Is it okay if I still miss him?

242
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,666
Yeah. We all will.

243
00:19:59,217 --> 00:20:02,412
You know,
Shyir really did save them all.

244
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:07,531
He asked me what i'd do if I had
another chance of saving my own planet.

245
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:12,468
And thats when it hit me,
I'd save the people.

246
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:15,074
At least one of us got it right.

247
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:38,995
<i>Cooling system now functional.
Continuing repairs.</i>

248
00:20:39,578 --> 00:20:41,331
So, what's next?

249
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:43,935
Next, we find the Red Lanterns.

250
00:20:44,923 --> 00:20:47,138
Just how are we gonna stop who knows

251
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:51,213
how many super poweredful
Red Lanterns with just the two of us?

252
00:20:51,582 --> 00:20:53,583
That's a really good question, Kilowog.

253
00:20:53,913 --> 00:20:57,250
Here's another one, what should
we do with the one we captured?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
