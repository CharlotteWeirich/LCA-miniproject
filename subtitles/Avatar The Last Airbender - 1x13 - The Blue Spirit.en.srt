<i>Earth.</i>

00:00:04,996 --> 00:00:07,104
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:08,396
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:13,596
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:17,675
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:21,988
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,148
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:29,310
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:31,150
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:33,356
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:37,089
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,712
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:50,524
Book One: Water
Chapter Thirteen: The Blue Spirit

15
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,449
Absolutely not.
The Yu Yan archers stay here.

16
00:01:18,538 --> 00:01:21,714
Your request is denied Commander Zhao.

17
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:27,376
Colonel Shinu, please reconsider. Their precision is legendary.

18
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:34,313
The Yu Yan can pin a fly to a tree from a hundred yards away... without killing it.

19
00:01:34,373 --> 00:01:38,150
You're wasting their talents using them as mere security guards.

20
00:01:38,203 --> 00:01:43,881
I can do whatever I want with their talents. They're my archers and what I say goes.

21
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:45,760
But my search for the Avatar is...

22
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:48,499
...Is nothing but a vanity project!

23
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:53,288
We're fighting a real war here and I need every man I've got, Commander.

24
00:01:53,343 --> 00:01:53,892
But...

25
00:01:53,968 --> 00:02:00,067
That's final! I don't want to hear another word about it.

26
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:12,131
News from Fire Lord Ozai?

27
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:21,154
It appears I've been promoted to Admiral. My request is now an order.

28
00:02:39,932 --> 00:02:42,664
This should bring your fever down.

29
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:47,287
You know what I love about Appa the most? His sense of humor.

30
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:50,608
That's nice. I'll tell him.

31
00:02:52,362 --> 00:02:53,946
Classic Appa.

32
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:55,148
How's Sokka doing?

33
00:02:55,221 --> 00:03:01,550
Not so good. Being out in that storm really did a number on him.

34
00:03:02,412 --> 00:03:06,123
I couldn't find any ginger root for the tea, but I found a map.

35
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,877
There's an herbalist institute on the top of that mountain.

36
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,149
We could probably find a cure for Sokka there.

37
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,416
Aang, he's in no condition to travel. Sokka just needs more rest.

38
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:19,375
I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow.

39
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:23,100
Not you too!

40
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:28,439
Relax, it was just a little cough. I'm fine...

41
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,780
That's how Sokka started yesterday.

42
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,598
Now look at him... he thinks he's an earthbender!

43
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:40,779
Take that, you rock!

44
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:43,591
A few more hours and you'll be talking nonsense too.

45
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:46,456
I'm going to find some medicine.

46
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:59,702
Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot. Keep an eye on 'em guys.

47
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,327
You guys are killin' me!

48
00:04:13,902 --> 00:04:17,367
We haven't been able to pick up the Avatar's trail since the storm.

49
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:21,584
But, if we continue heading northeast...

50
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:23,131
What do they want?

51
00:04:23,184 --> 00:04:28,333
Perhaps a sporting game of Pai Sho!

52
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,482
The hunt for the Avatar has been given prime importance.

53
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:38,944
All information regarding the Avatar must be reported directly to Admiral Zhao.

54
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:43,923
Zhao has been promoted? Well, good for him!

55
00:04:43,989 --> 00:04:49,291
I've got nothing to report to Zhao. Now get off my ship and let us pass.

56
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:53,402
Admiral Zhao is not allowing ships in or out of this area.

57
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:56,000
Off my ship!

58
00:04:56,067 --> 00:05:02,387
Excellent! I take the pot. But, you're all improving.

59
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,460
I'm certain you will win if we play again.

60
00:05:11,272 --> 00:05:16,075
Says here that the Avatar can create tornados and run faster than the wind.

61
00:05:16,143 --> 00:05:17,217
Pretty amazing.

62
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:25,075
Ehh, that's just a bunch of Fire Lord propaganda. There's no way that's true.

63
00:05:37,312 --> 00:05:40,897
Katara... please... water...

64
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:50,691
Listen carefully, Momo. I need you to take this to the river and fill it with water.

65
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,674
Got it?

66
00:06:13,175 --> 00:06:17,255
Hello! I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I need some medicine for my friends.

67
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:18,751
They have fevers and they've been coughing and...

68
00:06:18,817 --> 00:06:24,134
Settle down, young man. Your friends are going to be fine.

69
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:29,423
I've been up here for over fourty years you know, used to be others,...

70
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:35,638
...but they all left years ago. Now it's just me and Miyuki.

71
00:06:35,723 --> 00:06:36,663
That's nice.

72
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:42,585
Wounded Earth Kingdom troops still come by now and again, brave boys,...

73
00:06:42,664 --> 00:06:48,541
...and thanks to my remedies they always leave in better shape they when they arrive.

74
00:06:48,622 --> 00:06:50,544
That's nice. Are you almost done?

75
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:55,219
Hold on, I just need to add one last ingredient.

76
00:06:55,281 --> 00:07:01,148
Oh, sandalwood... oh, er, uh, that won't do, banana leaf?

77
00:07:01,223 --> 00:07:09,386
Ah, nope, uh, ginger root, uh uh, oh where is that pesky little plant?

78
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:20,980
Is everything okay? It's been almost an hour and you haven't given the men an order.

79
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:22,666
I don't care what they do.

80
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:27,624
Don't give up hope yet. You can still find the Avatar before Zhao.

81
00:07:27,706 --> 00:07:28,730
How, Uncle?

82
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:33,221
With Zhao's resources it's just a matter of time before he captures the Avatar.

83
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:40,526
My honor, my throne, my country, I'm about to lose them all.

84
00:07:40,774 --> 00:07:46,798
Oh, here's what I was looking for! Plum blossom!

85
00:07:46,864 --> 00:07:48,417
Finally!

86
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:49,454
Thanks for all your help!

87
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:52,362
Hands off! What do you think you're doing?

88
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,292
Taking the cure to my friends!

89
00:07:55,353 --> 00:07:58,707
This isn't a cure, it's Miyuki's dinner.

90
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,282
Plum blossom is her favorite.

91
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,887
What about my friends?

92
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:06,476
Well, all they need is some frozen wood frogs.

93
00:08:06,568 --> 00:08:09,154
There's plenty of them down in the valley swamp.

94
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:11,607
What am I supposed to do with frozen frogs?

95
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:14,078
Why, suck on them of course!

96
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,406
Suck on them!?

97
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:19,725
The frog's skin excretes a substance that'll cure your friends,...

98
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:26,950
...but make sure you get plenty. Once those little critters thaw out, they're useless!

99
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:28,446
You're insane aren't you?

100
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:31,449
Thaaat's right.

101
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:37,309
Well, don't stand there all day. Go!

102
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:56,542
Uhh, I think you dropped this.

103
00:09:47,762 --> 00:09:50,429
A frog!

104
00:10:28,956 --> 00:10:34,710
So this is the great Avatar? Master of all the elements.

105
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:39,329
I don't know how you've managed to elude the Fire Nation for a hundred years,...

106
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,132
...but your little game of hide and seek is over.

107
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:47,007
I've never hidden from you. Untie me and I'll fight you right now!

108
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:54,134
Uhh, no. Tell me, how does it feel to be the only airbender left?

109
00:10:54,174 --> 00:10:57,511
Do you miss your people?

110
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,702
Oh, don't worry, you won't be killed like they were.

111
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,581
See, if you die you'll just be reborn...

112
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:08,300
...and the Fire Nation will have to being its search for the Avatar all over again.

113
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:14,874
So, I'll keep you alive... but just barely.

114
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,905
Blow all the wind you want! Your situation is futile.

115
00:11:22,978 --> 00:11:31,715
There is no escaping this fortress... and no one is coming to rescue you.

116
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:36,807
Water...

117
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:41,743
Momo should be back any minute.

118
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:51,717
Ugh! No, Momo, water. Wa-ter!

119
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:58,491
Aang, what in the world is taking you so long?

120
00:12:30,471 --> 00:12:33,097
All clear.

121
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:47,431
All clear. Go on in.

122
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:12,095
We are the sons and daughters of fire! The superior element!

123
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:16,567
Until today, only one thing stood in our path to victory.

124
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:25,690
The Avatar! I am here to tell you that he is now my prisoner!

125
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:32,622
This is the year Sozen's comet returns to grant us its power!

126
00:13:32,672 --> 00:13:37,674
This is the year the Fire Nation breaks through the walls of Ba Sing Se...

127
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:42,847
...and burns the city to the ground!

128
00:13:59,268 --> 00:14:03,861
What? No! Don't leave frogs! My friends are sick and they need you!

129
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,322
Please go back to being frozen!

130
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:26,353
Who are you? What's going on? Are you here to rescue me?

131
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:29,952
I'll take that as a "yes."

132
00:15:34,397 --> 00:15:39,334
My frogs! Come back! And stop thawing out!

133
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:45,141
Wait! My friends need to suck on those frogs!

134
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:57,200
How many times do I have to tell you, Momo, we need water. Wa-ter.

135
00:15:57,238 --> 00:16:01,578
Oh forget it. Aang, please, hurry.

136
00:16:01,647 --> 00:16:07,748
Who's this "Aang" kid you keep talking about, Your Highness?

137
00:16:32,113 --> 00:16:36,161
I want a full transcription of my speech sent to the Fire Lord,...

138
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:43,761
...along with glowing testimonials from all of the ranking officers present, and...

139
00:16:52,454 --> 00:16:58,440
Sir, should I hold off sending that speech to the Fire Lord?

140
00:17:04,304 --> 00:17:07,485
There, on the wall!

141
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,861
The Avatar has escaped! Close all the gates immediately!

142
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:21,242
Stay close to me!

143
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,240
Take this. Jump on my back!

144
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:57,916
Gimme the next one!

145
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:20,774
Hold your fire! The Avatar must be captured alive!

146
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,539
Open the gate.

147
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:28,340
Admiral, what are you doing?

148
00:19:28,372 --> 00:19:33,032
Let them out, now!

149
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:35,510
How could you let them go?

150
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:42,049
A situation like this requires... precision.

151
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:58,318
Do you have a clear shot?

152
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:06,406
Knock out the thief. I'll deliver him to the Fire Lord along with the Avatar.

153
00:20:19,246 --> 00:20:22,353
Quick! Recover the Avatar!

154
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:09,507
You know what the worst part about being born over a hundred years ago is?

155
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:12,230
I miss all the friends I used to hang out with.

156
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:16,012
Before the war started, I used to always my friend Kuzan.

00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:20,547
The two of us, we'd get in and out of so much trouble together.

158
00:21:20,617 --> 00:21:23,309
He was one of the best friends I ever had...

159
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,731
...and he was from the Fire Nation, just like you.

160
00:21:26,805 --> 00:21:32,765
If we knew each other back then, do you think we could have been friends too?

161
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:54,493
Where have you been, Prince Zuko?

162
00:21:54,572 --> 00:22:00,511
You missed music night! Lieutenant Jee sang a stirring love song.

163
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:05,804
I'm going to bed. No disturbances.

164
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:19,957
Suck on these. They'll make you feel better.

165
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:25,646

166
00:22:25,698 --> 00:22:29,881
No, I don't think I did.

167
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:49,614
This is tasty!
