00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:09,483  X1:273 X2:444 Y1:495 Y2:516
Future Shock

2
00:00:38,813 --> 00:00:40,644  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:490 Y2:516
Good thing I noticed that.

3
00:00:40,853 --> 00:00:42,730  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:061 Y2:087
Planet Express stockholders.

4
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:48,644  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:061 Y2:121
I present our chief executive officer,
Professor Hubert Farnsworth.

5
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:52,322  X1:277 X2:439 Y1:061 Y2:121
- There he is!
- Take it off!

6
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:56,926  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:061 Y2:126
- Where am I?
- Move forward! Walk into the light!

7
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:01,604  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:492 Y2:516
Oh, God! I'm dead! Well, no matter.

8
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:03,724  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:490 Y2:516
Thank you all for coming.

9
00:01:03,893 --> 00:01:08,011  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:061 Y2:127
I don't recognize any of you,
nor can I recall why I am here.

10
00:01:08,253 --> 00:01:09,925  X1:215 X2:499 Y1:061 Y2:082
Without further ado...

11
00:01:10,093 --> 00:01:16,089  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:061 Y2:126
...a film highlighting Planet
Express, Inc.'s latest fiscal year.

12
00:01:16,373 --> 00:01:19,012  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:061 Y2:087
<i>Planet Express is on the move!</i>

13
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:22,808  X1:111 X2:603 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>For this hip, young delivery company,</i>
<i>tomorrow is today...</i>

14
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:27,285  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:061 Y2:121
<i>... and today is yesterday!</i>
<i>You heard me.</i>

15
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:34,612  X1:151 X2:561 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>It was a year of soaring profits</i>
<i>and significant one-time losses.</i>

16
00:01:36,253 --> 00:01:39,882  X1:089 X2:626 Y1:061 Y2:126
Watching myself work makes me hungry.
Help me find food.

17
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,330  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:061 Y2:127
I'll not only find it,
I'll help you do more to it.

18
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:51,652  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:451 Y2:516
A Bot-Mitzvah!
Shalom, hunger. Shalom, free food.

19
00:01:51,813 --> 00:01:54,008  X1:279 X2:437 Y1:495 Y2:516
No shellfish!

20
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:57,842  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:456 Y2:516
- That is so unfair.
- Tell me about it.

21
00:02:07,773 --> 00:02:10,606  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:455 Y2:516
So you guys don't believe
in Robot-Jesus?

22
00:02:10,853 --> 00:02:15,483  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:456 Y2:516
He was built and was well-programmed,
but he wasn't our messiah.

23
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:19,286  X1:104 X2:607 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>And so, our company flames onwards.</i>

24
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:23,412  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:456 Y2:516
<i>Planet Express: limitless potential,</i>
<i>boundless horizons!</i>

25
00:02:23,573 --> 00:02:28,203  X1:180 X2:542 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>The unstoppable juggernaut</i>
<i>of the corporate universe!</i>

26
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:33,447  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's been a terrible year. The company
is on the verge of bankruptcy.

27
00:02:33,613 --> 00:02:37,401  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:451 Y2:516
- But the movie...
- A substantial loss for the company.

28
00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:41,288  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:451 Y2:516
The blue pie slice represents
the money we earned.

29
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:45,731  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:455 Y2:516
The green slice represents
an $8 bank error in our favor.

30
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:49,482  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:456 Y2:516
What about our thousands
of shares of stock?

31
00:02:49,693 --> 00:02:51,331  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Worthless.
- I'll kill you!

32
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:56,482  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:456 Y2:516
I own one share of Planet kajiggers,
so I'm entitled to some answers.

33
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:59,969  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:451 Y2:516
Question: Why does no one
visit me in my home?

34
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:03,688  X1:193 X2:521 Y1:451 Y2:516
Your apartment smells
like Polygrip and cat pee!

35
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:07,284  X1:213 X2:501 Y1:490 Y2:516
This is perfect for me!

36
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:14,409  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:451 Y2:516
Do you have to have been
cryogenically frozen to get the free...?

37
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:18,401  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:450 Y2:516
You didn't let me finish!
I was going to say "free food"!

38
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:25,286  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:453 Y2:516
- My name's Joe and I'm a defrostee.
- Hello, Joe!

39
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:28,291  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:456 Y2:516
When I was frozen,
carrots ruled the earth.

40
00:03:28,493 --> 00:03:32,850  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:516
But now they don't.
It takes some getting used to.

41
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,730  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:456 Y2:516
In the 1 980s,
I was the toast of Wall Street.

42
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:40,050  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:456 Y2:516
I had whiskey with Boesky,
cookies with Milken.

43
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:43,768  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:456 Y2:516
But then, I was diagnosed
with terminal bone-itis.

44
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:47,727  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:455 Y2:516
Bone-itis? That's a funny name
for a horrible disease.

45
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:51,130  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:451 Y2:516
There was no cure.
One drug company was close...

46
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:57,323  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:456 Y2:516
...but I arranged a hostile takeover
and sold its assets. Made 1 00 mil.

47
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:04,653  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:490 Y2:516
I froze myself until a cure was found.

48
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:11,002  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:451 Y2:516
And now here I am, ready to sleaze
my way back to the top, '80s style!

49
00:04:11,213 --> 00:04:15,206  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:451 Y2:516
As a caveman frozen in a glacier,
I face many challenges.

50
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:20,407  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:451 Y2:516
The hardest thing was seeing my wife
on display in the British Museum.

51
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:25,402  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm from your time.
Remember that song, "Safety Dance"?

52
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:26,841  X1:303 X2:412 Y1:495 Y2:516
Sure do.

53
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,364  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:494 Y2:516
That dance wasn't that safe.

54
00:04:35,573 --> 00:04:40,169  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:455 Y2:516
I tell you, two go-go '80s Reaganauts
like us could rule this world!

55
00:04:40,373 --> 00:04:43,126  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Right.
- lf only someone would give us a shot.

56
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:48,447  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:450 Y2:516
They're scared of us. But if you want
a job, I could beg my company.

57
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:51,845  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:495 Y2:516
Awesome. Awesome to the max!

58
00:04:52,213 --> 00:04:56,729  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:451 Y2:516
And finally, the post office meter
is for business mail only.

59
00:04:56,933 --> 00:05:00,289  X1:194 X2:520 Y1:455 Y2:516
Come on! I've got a lot
of ransom notes to send!

60
00:05:00,493 --> 00:05:02,848  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:490 Y2:516
Enough talk! Time for action!

61
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,408  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:490 Y2:516
I move that everyone comes over...

62
00:05:05,613 --> 00:05:07,569  X1:217 X2:498 Y1:456 Y2:516
...to snuggle my cat!
- Second.

63
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:11,083  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:456 Y2:516
- I move your cat stinks and is ugly!
- Second.

64
00:05:11,293 --> 00:05:15,969  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:451 Y2:516
I move that we vote on a new CEO
and oust this old creep!

65
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:20,132  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:456 Y2:516
- And my cat smells good and is pretty.
- Second.

66
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,689  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Very well. I nominate the Professor!
- Second!

67
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:27,403  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I'm your man!
- I vote my shares for the Professor.

68
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:29,211  X1:260 X2:456 Y1:456 Y2:516
- The Professor!
- Me!

69
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,051  X1:227 X2:488 Y1:490 Y2:516
I nominate that guy.

70
00:05:33,253 --> 00:05:38,327  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:456 Y2:516
Because he knows about business
and stuff and has a tie.

71
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:41,532  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:451 Y2:516
Shares still count
if they were washed, right?

72
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:47,408  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:451 Y2:516
If I know anything
about which number is bigger...

73
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:51,811  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:451 Y2:516
Hold on! Scruffy votes his 40,000
shares for the stranger.

74
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:56,086  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:456 Y2:516
You have four times as much stock
as the rest of us?

75
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,723  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:490 Y2:516
Scruffy believes in this company.

76
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:06,170  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:453 Y2:516
It's a tie. In the event of a tie, the
Professor, as current CEO, remains...

77
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:11,401  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:451 Y2:516
I demand the floor! I may only have
one share, but I get to vote too!

78
00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:16,448  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:516
And I'm voting against the cat-hater!
Isn't that right, kitty?

79
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:19,969  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hey! You ate my change!

80
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:26,241  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's settled. The new chief executive
officer of Planet Express is...

81
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,603  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:489 Y2:516
..."That Guy"!

82
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:40,446  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:451 Y2:516
Please welcome our new
chief executive officer, That Guy!

83
00:06:44,373 --> 00:06:48,605  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:451 Y2:516
There are two kinds of people:
sheep and sharks.

84
00:06:48,813 --> 00:06:52,044  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:450 Y2:516
Anyone who's a sheep is fired.
Who's a sheep?

85
00:06:52,293 --> 00:06:55,330  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:451 Y2:516
Excuse me,
which one do people like to hug?

86
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:59,492  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:455 Y2:516
Gutsy question. You're a shark.
Sharks don't look back...

87
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:03,169  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:450 Y2:516
...because they don't have necks.
Necks are for sheep.

88
00:07:04,373 --> 00:07:07,285  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:455 Y2:516
I'm proud to shepherd this herd
of sharks...

89
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:11,811  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:451 Y2:516
...and I am gonna lead you to the top
in this industry of...

90
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:15,801  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Package delivery.
- Package delivery?! Oh, God!

91
00:07:16,013 --> 00:07:22,122  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:451 Y2:516
Fantastic! The first order of business,
blame everything on the guy before me.

92
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,848  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Professor?
- I'll ruin you like I did this company!

93
00:07:26,053 --> 00:07:31,207  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:451 Y2:516
Terrific. Question number one:
What was your overall business plan?

94
00:07:31,613 --> 00:07:36,482  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
Business plan? Yes.
I keep it here, right next to my heart.

95
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:43,165  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:451 Y2:516
This is no business plan,
it's an escape plan.

96
00:07:43,373 --> 00:07:46,410  X1:244 X2:470 Y1:490 Y2:516
So long, suckers!

97
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:54,849  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:450 Y2:516
Fry, as a fellow '80s dollar jockey,
I'm making you my new vice chairman.

98
00:07:55,053 --> 00:07:57,009  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:489 Y2:516
I'm rolling up the corporate ramp!

99
00:07:57,213 --> 00:07:59,443  X1:266 X2:450 Y1:455 Y2:516
- It's the end!
- We're ruined!

100
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:05,011  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:451 Y2:516
What fevered dream is this that bids
to tear this company in twain?

101
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,567  X1:199 X2:515 Y1:490 Y2:516
Thank you. Come again.

102
00:08:09,773 --> 00:08:13,209  X1:112 X2:602 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's what I call a hostile makeover.
Hair gel?

103
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:16,211  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:490 Y2:516
No, thanks. I make my own.

104
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:32,804  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:516
We'll shoot straight to the top
and stay there, like Cindy Lauper!

105
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:37,370  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:451 Y2:516
I ask you, who is the number one
delivery service on earth?

106
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:42,283  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Is it Planet Express, master?
- Is this guy a shark or what?

107
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:45,684  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:451 Y2:516
Seriously, we stink.
Here's the big enchirito.

108
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:50,367  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:489 Y2:516
Mom's Friendly Delivery Company.

109
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:55,408  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:455 Y2:516
We can't compete! Her company is big
and evil. We're small and neutral.

110
00:08:55,613 --> 00:09:00,892  X1:096 X2:618 Y1:450 Y2:516
Switzerland is small and neutral. We're
Germany, ambitious and misunderstood.

111
00:09:01,093 --> 00:09:05,928  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:451 Y2:516
Everyone wants to be like Germany.
Do we have the strength of will?

112
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:10,411  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
I say we do! Will we let ourselves
get beaten by an old lady?

113
00:09:10,613 --> 00:09:12,205  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:490 Y2:516
Yes, my liege.

114
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:18,090  X1:122 X2:592 Y1:451 Y2:516
No! I speak for the entire board
when I issue this challenge to Mom!

115
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:21,012  X1:251 X2:465 Y1:490 Y2:516
Look at my butt!

116
00:09:23,573 --> 00:09:27,885  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:454 Y2:516
You call that a pressed ham?
Walt, hit the retaliate button!

117
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:32,849  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Let's see...
- Any button! They all retaliate!

118
00:09:54,773 --> 00:09:57,003  X1:156 X2:558 Y1:493 Y2:516
Yeah! Hit him, hit him, hit him!

119
00:09:57,213 --> 00:10:00,683  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:451 Y2:516
This is the high life!
Watching apes kill each other.

120
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:05,085  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:451 Y2:516
In my day, we had coke parties,
but the principle's the same.

121
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:09,852  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:451 Y2:516
Get your stinking trike off me,
you damn, dirty ape!

122
00:10:10,053 --> 00:10:12,283  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:489 Y2:516
Now that you're my protégé...

123
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:16,845  X1:122 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:516
...it's time I cut you in on the secret
to success. Any guesses?

124
00:10:17,093 --> 00:10:18,845  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Work really hard?
- No.

125
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:22,722  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Oh, thank God!
- It's all about appearances.

126
00:10:22,973 --> 00:10:25,851  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's time to update
our company's image...

127
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:30,883  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:451 Y2:516
...and give it the sleek,
dazzling veneer of the 1 980s!

128
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:42,646  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:455 Y2:516
This company's on the fast track
to the It List. Kudos!

129
00:10:42,853 --> 00:10:46,562  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:450 Y2:516
We haven't made one delivery
since you two took over.

130
00:10:46,773 --> 00:10:49,890  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:456 Y2:516
Delivery has nothing to do
with our business.

131
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:52,886  X1:206 X2:508 Y1:451 Y2:516
Image, people!
Scope out this new ad!

132
00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:59,043  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>We are all one. One mind.</i>
<i>One purpose. One act.</i>

133
00:10:59,253 --> 00:11:01,721  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Our enemy shall be eaten</i>
<i>by scorpions.</i>

134
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:06,001  X1:189 X2:524 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>And we shall bow down</i>
<i>and worship to ourselves.</i>

135
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:09,410  X1:253 X2:468 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>We shall prevail!</i>

136
00:11:11,013 --> 00:11:13,129  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>Hey, we were watching that!</i>

137
00:11:16,013 --> 00:11:18,481  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:451 Y2:516
Terrible!
People won't know what we do.

138
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:23,721  X1:100 X2:615 Y1:450 Y2:516
I don't know what we do. Just kidding.
What are we, a bus or something?

139
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,811  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Did you approve that awful ad, Fry?
- I did...

140
00:11:27,013 --> 00:11:30,244  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:450 Y2:516
...and I'll tell you why.
It grows the brand.

141
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:31,647  X1:298 X2:418 Y1:493 Y2:516
Oh, Lord.

142
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:37,209  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:516
This company's circling the drain!
I'd sell my stock for a sandwich.

143
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:38,402  X1:325 X2:390 Y1:495 Y2:516
Sold!

144
00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:44,205  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:490 Y2:516
A complete sandwich!

145
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:50,249  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:451 Y2:516
You got fleeced. I would have settled
for a hard roll with ketchup inside.

146
00:11:53,573 --> 00:11:56,133  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:490 Y2:516
What is this moose drip?

147
00:11:57,493 --> 00:12:02,692  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:061 Y2:127
"The New Delivery Kings"? I'm sick
of hearing about those turtle squirts!

148
00:12:02,893 --> 00:12:07,489  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:516
- But they're kings, Mommy.
- Jam a bastard in it, you crap!

149
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:15,685  X1:104 X2:610 Y1:451 Y2:516
Our private dining room. This is where
we serve our most successful chumps.

150
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:17,332  X1:237 X2:478 Y1:489 Y2:516
Tonight, that's us.

151
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:19,649  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:450 Y2:516
- What's overpriced?
- Everything.

152
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:23,010  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Bring me that.
- Me too. And a glass of water.

153
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:27,889  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:455 Y2:516
Okay, let's work on your execu-speak.
I'm worried about "blank."

154
00:12:28,093 --> 00:12:30,766  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:450 Y2:516
Don't worry.
Let me worry about "blank."

155
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:34,283  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:456 Y2:516
Good. I also would have accepted:
"Blank? Blank!

156
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:37,411  X1:234 X2:480 Y1:450 Y2:516
You're not looking
at the big picture!"

157
00:12:38,613 --> 00:12:40,649  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:490 Y2:516
What a pleasant surprise.

158
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:44,289  X1:199 X2:515 Y1:456 Y2:516
Shut up, booger-blaster!
It's time we all talk.

159
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:49,607  X1:132 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'll handle this, Fry. You get back
to the farm, shift some paradigms.

160
00:12:49,813 --> 00:12:53,931  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm on it. But if you need me,
you know where I'll be.

161
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:02,730  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:451 Y2:516
Call me a booger-blaster!
I'll blast a booger...

162
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:08,724  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:516
- We're worried about Planet Express.
- Don't. Let me worry about "blank."

163
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:13,609  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:450 Y2:516
That Guy is a con man, and you've
been hypnotized by his bologna!

164
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:17,004  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:516
- You've changed, Fry.
- What? I haven't changed.

165
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,602  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Suz, have I changed?
<i>- No, Mr. Fry.</i>

166
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:21,405  X1:274 X2:441 Y1:493 Y2:516
Thanks, doll.

167
00:13:21,613 --> 00:13:26,607  X1:111 X2:603 Y1:450 Y2:516
I don't care. That Guy's turning
this place into some kind of business.

168
00:13:26,813 --> 00:13:29,407  X1:219 X2:495 Y1:450 Y2:516
This isn't a business!
I thought of it...

169
00:13:29,653 --> 00:13:33,282  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:451 Y2:516
...as a source of cheap labor.
Like a family.

170
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:37,651  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:516
Right. We're not a traditional family
like the Murphys...

171
00:13:37,893 --> 00:13:43,570  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:450 Y2:516
...or the lesbian coven, but we're
a family. That Guy understands that.

172
00:13:43,773 --> 00:13:47,368  X1:182 X2:530 Y1:456 Y2:516
<i>Everyone's fired,</i>
<i>and we're out of business.</i>

173
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:52,442  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>I'm selling Planet Express to Mom.</i>
<i>She'll gut the company, eliminate us.</i>

174
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:55,412  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Don 't let the door hit you</i>
<i>on the way out.</i>

175
00:13:55,653 --> 00:13:58,292  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>I don 't want ass prints</i>
<i>on my new door!</i>

176
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:11,372  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:456 Y2:516
Ms. Johnson, please bring in
some more chair fuel.

177
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:21,202  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:451 Y2:516
I had no idea the company would be
sold! I was just an innocent suck-up!

178
00:14:21,813 --> 00:14:25,647  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:456 Y2:516
Leave us alone
and let us clear out our lockers.

179
00:14:28,653 --> 00:14:34,011  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's so sad!
Where will I go? What will I do?

180
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:38,001  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:453 Y2:516
You have Mrs. Darlinghaven's cotillion
at 7, ma'am.

181
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:39,931  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:494 Y2:516
That'll be fun.

182
00:14:44,613 --> 00:14:48,288  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:450 Y2:516
Ms. Johnson, you've never lied to me.
Am I a good person?

183
00:14:48,493 --> 00:14:51,530  X1:158 X2:554 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>I don 't know.</i>
<i>I'm a program in the intercom.</i>

184
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:55,009  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:453 Y2:516
I've got to redeem myself!
Somehow, sometime...

185
00:14:55,213 --> 00:14:58,603  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:456 Y2:516
...for some reason,
I'll block this takeover!

186
00:14:58,813 --> 00:15:01,327  X1:121 X2:592 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>Mr. Fry, your 2:00 magician is here.</i>

187
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:07,005  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:451 Y2:516
I have more important things to do
today than laugh and clap my hands.

188
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:08,487  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:495 Y2:516
Reschedule.

189
00:15:33,973 --> 00:15:37,363  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Sell 1 00 soylent beans!
- Buy 3000 corn bellies!

190
00:15:37,573 --> 00:15:40,883  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Two hundred cans of Whoop-Ass!
- Three bags of trash!

191
00:15:41,093 --> 00:15:45,086  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:451 Y2:516
Attention. The takeover of PlanEx
by Mom's Delivery Company...

192
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,131  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:490 Y2:516
...will take place in 1 0 minutes.

193
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:51,683  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:490 Y2:516
I am Jorell, master of scheduling!

194
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:03,766  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:455 Y2:516
Okay. We've got the hot tub hot, the
wine coolers cool. It's Hammer time!

195
00:16:05,813 --> 00:16:08,008  X1:293 X2:421 Y1:495 Y2:516
You suck!

196
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:12,811  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:451 Y2:516
By regulation, both companies
must approve the takeover.

197
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,925  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:451 Y2:516
Planet Express shareholders,
please vote.

198
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:20,604  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:451 Y2:516
Great Bonda of Uganda!
We can vote against it!

199
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,203  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:455 Y2:516
I'll vote it down like a raise
for school teachers!

200
00:16:35,853 --> 00:16:40,768  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:451 Y2:516
The shares I bought from Dr. Zoidberg
gave me majority control.

201
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:43,407  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:490 Y2:516
Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?

202
00:16:43,653 --> 00:16:47,202  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:451 Y2:516
The shares were worthless!
He asked for toilet paper!

203
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:52,362  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:456 Y2:516
And now if MomCorp shareholders
will cast their ballots.

204
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:06,727  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:490 Y2:516
The ballot was confusing!

205
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:09,891  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:451 Y2:516
- How about a hand re-count?
- Okay.

206
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:13,005  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:451 Y2:516
The takeover of Planet Express
is approved!

207
00:17:14,573 --> 00:17:16,848  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:451 Y2:516
- This stinks!
- Madame is outraged!

208
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:21,092  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:456 Y2:516
Security! I want that bunch
of rowdies out of here!

209
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,801  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:495 Y2:516
Wait a minute! Hold on!

210
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:32,127  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:451 Y2:516
MomCorp will purchase all shares
of Planet Express...

211
00:17:32,373 --> 00:17:34,967  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:456 Y2:516
...at the current market price,
which is...

212
00:17:35,293 --> 00:17:37,011  X1:229 X2:491 Y1:495 Y2:516
<i>One hundred seven!</i>

213
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:45,403  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:451 Y2:516
- And also it hurt my feelings!
- What are you solids griping about?

214
00:17:45,613 --> 00:17:48,446  X1:123 X2:591 Y1:490 Y2:516
Your shares are worth $ 1 07 apiece.

215
00:17:48,653 --> 00:17:54,205  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm a millionaire! Suddenly I have an
opinion about the capital gains tax!

216
00:17:54,413 --> 00:17:59,407  X1:242 X2:474 Y1:455 Y2:516
- I'm even richer!
- I have no shares!

217
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:04,891  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:451 Y2:516
Wait! My sandwich! Has it also
appreciated in value? Please!

218
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:12,329  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:450 Y2:516
- You didn't refrigerate it, spineless!
- You had to drag spines into this!

219
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:18,323  X1:177 X2:535 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>As vice chairman,</i>
<i>I'd like to say a few words.</i>

220
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:22,048  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:456 Y2:516
<i>A time comes for every man</i>
<i>that deserts his friends...</i>

221
00:18:22,293 --> 00:18:26,002  X1:135 X2:579 Y1:453 Y2:516
<i>... when he goes back how it was.</i>
<i>For me, that time is now.</i>

222
00:18:26,213 --> 00:18:29,569  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:451 Y2:516
So I ask you, as a friend,
stop this deal.

223
00:18:29,773 --> 00:18:32,526  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm an '80s guy.
Friendship means for $2...

224
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:38,962  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:451 Y2:516
...I beat you till you got detached
retinas. The deal will go ahead as...

225
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:47,690  X1:291 X2:424 Y1:490 Y2:516
My bones!

226
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:50,003  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:490 Y2:516
Oh, my God! His bone-itis!

227
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:53,888  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:516
I was so busy being an '80s guy,
I forgot to cure it!

228
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:01,092  X1:234 X2:481 Y1:490 Y2:516
My only regret is...

229
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,891  X1:260 X2:456 Y1:495 Y2:516
...that I have...

230
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:04,612  X1:285 X2:432 Y1:495 Y2:516
...bone-itis!

231
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:08,808  X1:289 X2:426 Y1:494 Y2:516
He's dead!

232
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:13,445  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:456 Y2:516
Feed him to the jackals!
Go on with the sale!

233
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:18,687  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:516
I don't think so! As vice chairman,
I gain voting control of his shares.

234
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:22,363  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:455 Y2:516
- Don't be a fool!
- I'll be whatever I want to do!

235
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:25,406  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:456 Y2:516
That Guy was the greatest
businessman ever.

236
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:29,003  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:451 Y2:516
Before his death,
he taught me everything he knew.

237
00:19:29,213 --> 00:19:31,647  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:490 Y2:516
But some things I had to learn myself.

238
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:35,243  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:451 Y2:516
I learned money is fine,
but what counts is people.

239
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:38,087  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:489 Y2:516
You can't put a price on that.

240
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:42,406  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:450 Y2:516
So I'm giving control of the company
to a man of experience...

241
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:45,810  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:495 Y2:516
...Professor Hubert Farnsworth!

242
00:19:46,213 --> 00:19:49,808  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:494 Y2:516
What? I'm awake! I'm awake!

243
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,167  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:490 Y2:516
Stop doing the right thing, jerk!

244
00:19:55,373 --> 00:20:00,811  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Let Mom buy it! We want to be rich!
- Two out of three doesn't cut it.

245
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:04,005  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:450 Y2:516
You'd rather be rich
than work together?

246
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:05,532  X1:290 X2:426 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hell, yeah!

247
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:10,210  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:451 Y2:516
This company was the only place
I ever really felt at home.

248
00:20:10,413 --> 00:20:14,042  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:451 Y2:516
If being millionaires is more
important than friendship...

249
00:20:14,253 --> 00:20:18,212  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:450 Y2:516
...then I'll sell Planet Express,
for you.

250
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:22,811  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:450 Y2:516
Millionaires nothing! The stock's
only worth three kajiggers!

251
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,492  X1:297 X2:419 Y1:495 Y2:516
Come on!

252
00:20:24,693 --> 00:20:27,810  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:455 Y2:516
It's worth less now
than when it was worthless!

253
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:32,803  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:455 Y2:516
It is? We're poor no matter
what I do! The deal is off!

254
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:39,328  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:451 Y2:516
Once again, the conservative
sandwich-heavy portfolio...

255
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:42,804  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:490 Y2:516
...pays off for the hungry investor!

256
00:20:44,013 --> 00:20:47,005  X1:261 X2:455 Y1:492 Y2:516
Oh, I'm ruined!

257
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,563  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:490 Y2:516
Why? Why?

258
00:20:49,773 --> 00:20:54,130  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:450 Y2:516
So we're not millionaires.
But we still get to work together.

259
00:20:54,373 --> 00:20:56,807  X1:222 X2:493 Y1:490 Y2:516
Shut your fat mouth!

260
00:20:57,013 --> 00:20:59,368  X1:209 X2:505 Y1:490 Y2:516
See you guys Monday!
