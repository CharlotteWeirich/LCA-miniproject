2
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,360
Where's the professor?

3
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,770
Eh, probably dead.

4
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:30,906
Already dissolving
in a bathtub, if we're lucky.

5
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:34,184
I was out on the widow's walk
keeping a hopeless vigil

6
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:37,162
for the return
of my first delivery crew.

7
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:40,332
It's been 50 years
since they disappeared.

8
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,902
Huh, I knew you had other crews,

9
00:00:42,027 --> 00:00:44,419
but you never told us
you had a first crew.

10
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:47,711
I remember it
like it was interesting.

11
00:00:47,836 --> 00:00:50,258
<i>I had just built my new</i>

12
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:52,302
<i>shipping and receiving emporium,</i>

13
00:00:52,468 --> 00:00:55,220
<i>and I scoured the hardware
store parking lot</i>

14
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:58,141
<i>to assemble
the finest crew imaginable.</i>

15
00:00:58,307 --> 00:01:02,160
<i>There was Candy, the raunchy
by-the-books navigator;</i>

16
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:05,524
<i>Lifter, the devastatingly
handsome forklift;</i>

17
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,565
<i>and Captain Lando Tucker,</i>

18
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,196
<i>a dedicated young man
with no characteristics.</i>

19
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,541
We'll deliver that
package or die trying.

20
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,944
Hey, it's all my favorite patients.

21
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:19,281
And also Captain Tucker.
Pow!

22
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:21,885
Whoa!

23
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,754
You totally got me, Dr. John.

24
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:25,046
You're hilarious.

25
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:26,759
Zoidberg was popular?

26
00:01:26,884 --> 00:01:28,427
Zoidberg had hair?

27
00:01:28,552 --> 00:01:30,596
I never said he had hair!

28
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,966
If you chose to imagine him
that way, that's your business.

29
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:34,534
Anyway,

30
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:37,806
<i>the time came for our first delivery.</i>

31
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:42,185
Lando, don't forget
about me and Junior.

32
00:01:42,351 --> 00:01:43,409
I won't, honey.

33
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:44,771
Or die trying.

34
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:46,578
Well, crew, this is it.

35
00:01:46,703 --> 00:01:50,527
That cookie bouquet
isn't going to deliver itself.

36
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,320
<i>Ten...</i>

37
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:54,622
nine and so on.

38
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,592
Three...

39
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,035
two, one...

40
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,285
Go, you big metal bird.

41
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,085
Get up there.

42
00:02:17,608 --> 00:02:18,886
Incredible!

43
00:02:19,011 --> 00:02:20,878
Zoidberg had friends?

44
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,517
It was a different time.

45
00:02:22,683 --> 00:02:24,358
<i>Everything was going smoothly</i>

46
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:27,194
<i>until right after that part
I was just telling you about.</i>

47
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,264
<i>Suddenly, Amanda's aunt called to say</i>

48
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:33,487
<i>her niece hadn't received
her cookie bouquet.</i>

49
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,209
<i>I watched the skies for weeks,</i>

50
00:02:43,334 --> 00:02:47,667
<i>with only occasional breaks
to tend to my grief diarrhea.</i>

51
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,420
<i>Just when all hope was lost...</i>

52
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:53,813
The ship's escape pod!

53
00:02:57,418 --> 00:02:58,786
What happened up there, Johnny?

54
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,788
Oh, don't make me remember.

55
00:03:01,138 --> 00:03:02,499
So horrible it was.

56
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:06,661
I thought you said
he didn't have hair.

57
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,207
Yes, but something he saw
on that mission

58
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:12,410
traumatized him so severely,
he grew hair,

59
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:14,446
just so it could turn white.

60
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:18,583
Sadly, my brave crew
was gone forever.

61
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:24,322
Oh, that poor incompetent crew.

62
00:03:24,447 --> 00:03:25,557
What do you think
happened, Professor?

63
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:29,795
They were lost
in the Bermuda Tetrahedron.

64
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:32,783
That's ridiculous.

65
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:34,924
The Bermuda Tetrahedron
is just a myth.

66
00:03:35,297 --> 00:03:38,738
I'm glad you're so brave in
the face of the unknown, Leela,

67
00:03:38,863 --> 00:03:40,407
because, for your next mission,

68
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:42,666
you'll be flying directly through

69
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,644
the Bermuda Tetrahedron!

70
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:47,814
Or we could fly around it.

71
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:49,249
Of course you could.

72
00:03:49,374 --> 00:03:51,273
You'd be stupid not to.

73
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,620
Supposing we're not stupid.

74
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:54,812
What kind of stupid mission is this?

75
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,726
You'll be picking up a monument
commemorating my lost crew,

76
00:03:58,851 --> 00:04:02,363
to be unveiled Tuesday
at their memorial ceremony.

77
00:04:02,488 --> 00:04:04,911
All the grieving families
will be there,

78
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:06,997
plus a Popsicle cart.

79
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,636
You can count on us, Professor.

80
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:10,638
We'll get that
monument here in time.

81
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:12,174
Hooray!

82
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:13,408
Or die trying.

83
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:14,834
What?

84
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:29,426
Here you go.

85
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:32,229
In memory of the first Planet
Express ship and its crew.

86
00:04:32,354 --> 00:04:33,521
Hang on.

87
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,366
It shouldn't have an apostrophe.

88
00:04:35,491 --> 00:04:37,668
This means "and it is crew."

89
00:04:37,793 --> 00:04:39,327
What the hell's wrong with you?

90
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,871
It's a minor error, lady.

91
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:42,505
I mean, we're space aliens.

92
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,407
It's a miracle
we can even speak English.

93
00:04:44,532 --> 00:04:46,867
The miracle is that
I'm not kicking your ass.

94
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:49,913
I insist you re-carve
the entire statue correctly.

95
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:51,972
Okay, okay.

96
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:55,376
Hey, Charlie, hack off
another block of ivory!

97
00:05:03,412 --> 00:05:05,594
Well, the statue's perfect now.

98
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:06,765
Too bad we won't make it back in time

99
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,683
for the memorial service.

100
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:09,568
We'll make it.

101
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:11,436
Or die trying.

102
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,706
We're cutting through

103
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:14,707
the Bermuda Tetrahedron!

104
00:05:14,832 --> 00:05:15,965
Whoo!

105
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,835
Wait, the <i>Bermuda</i> Tetrahedron?

106
00:05:26,408 --> 00:05:29,679
I think I'm remembering
that thing I forgot.

107
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:33,782
Uh-oh, the dials are terrified.

108
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,784
Brace yourselves.

109
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,786
It's Tickle Me Elmo's Fire.

110
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:42,758
Ow! Oh!

111
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,436
Ow-ow-ow!

112
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:45,637
There. See?

113
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,839
It was no big thing.

114
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,099
What was that big thing?

115
00:05:56,373 --> 00:05:58,041
<i>It's a spaceship graveyard.</i>

116
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,219
Why did we have to
come here at night?

117
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:02,889
Look at all these famous lost ships.

118
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:04,290
There's the Garmin!

119
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:05,491
And the TomTom!

120
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,367
Over there!

121
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,828
It's the original
Planet Express ship!

122
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:11,254
What caused all that damage?

123
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,498
Could it have been flavor-blasted?

124
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,667
We'd better investigate.

125
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,435
Looks like an ion storm, though.

126
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,993
Everyone, suit up!

127
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:25,644
Whatever happened here, that
first crew left in a hurry.

128
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:28,480
The table is still set for
a McDonald's value dinner.

129
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:30,382
I remember, I remember!

130
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:32,618
This is what traumatized me.

131
00:06:32,743 --> 00:06:35,512
Such a meal to go to waste!

132
00:06:39,385 --> 00:06:42,630
And with that...
I have closure.

133
00:06:42,755 --> 00:06:45,780
Hey, Zoidberg, you're cockatieling.

134
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:48,091
Oh, no. Something's happening.

135
00:06:48,216 --> 00:06:49,242
What's happening?

136
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:57,061
Oh, right.

137
00:06:57,186 --> 00:06:59,794
And there was
a giant killer space whale.

138
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,987
Holy crap, it's a giant space fish!

139
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:11,056
Actually, the space whale
isn't a space fish.

140
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,424
It's a space mammal.

141
00:07:12,549 --> 00:07:13,993
Wow, interesting.

142
00:07:14,118 --> 00:07:15,769
I'm both impressed and being eaten.

143
00:07:17,254 --> 00:07:18,521
Spacewalk, people!

144
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:20,624
Spacewalk for your lives!

145
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,172
Man, look at him go.

146
00:07:25,297 --> 00:07:27,363
Like a millionaire
on a cocktail wiener.

147
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:50,063
I did it. I outran him.

148
00:07:50,188 --> 00:07:51,721
Relax, friends.

149
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:56,337
Panic, jerks!

150
00:07:57,663 --> 00:07:59,373
That's no ordinary space whale!

151
00:07:59,498 --> 00:08:01,609
It's a four-dimensional space whale!

152
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:03,044
Of course!

153
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:05,213
And it only breaches
into our 3-D universe

154
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:07,583
to hunt and fill it's lungs
with vacuum.

155
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:09,318
Whatever its beef is,

156
00:08:09,443 --> 00:08:12,450
our one mission now is
to get that monument to Earth.

157
00:08:15,577 --> 00:08:17,956
our one mission now is

158
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:20,125
to avenge the loss of that monument.

159
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,269
Smeesh!

160
00:08:28,394 --> 00:08:30,004
He gonked off the engines.

161
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:31,177
That won't stop me.

162
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:32,846
Raise the solar sails!

163
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,181
I'm going after that Mobius Dick!

164
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,018
You've been hitting
the Red Stripe, woman!

165
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:41,115
Comport yourself, Mr. Conrad!

166
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,750
When we're at space,
the captain's word is law.

167
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,285
I could marry you and Bender

168
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,054
against your will, if I wanted to.

169
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:49,589
You wouldn't dare!

170
00:08:49,714 --> 00:08:51,197
I've been married to worse.

171
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:53,427
Leela, I'm not doctor, but I'm afraid

172
00:08:53,552 --> 00:08:55,702
you be exhibiting symptoms of illin'.

173
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,033
You're risking all our lives
for your own personal obsession.

174
00:08:59,158 --> 00:09:01,369
There's nothing personal about this.

175
00:09:01,494 --> 00:09:03,835
That thing screwed up my delivery!

176
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,275
This time, it's business.

177
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:08,381
♪ ♪

178
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,144
Maybe if I move
the compass like this,

179
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:44,870
it will somehow kill the whale.

180
00:09:46,874 --> 00:09:48,651
Leela, we need to talk.

181
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:52,675
You've gone from crazy like
a fox to crazy like Fox News.

182
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:54,424
Fear not the space behemoth.

183
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:57,561
In my dreams,
I've peered beyond its eyes

184
00:09:57,686 --> 00:10:00,266
and into the cackling hell
within us all.

185
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:02,894
Okay, that's a good point.

186
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,667
Fry's right!
Let's kill the captain

187
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:06,202
and order some strippers!

188
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:07,404
Yeah, what he said.

189
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:09,067
It's a mutiny led by Fry!

190
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,819
That's enough insubordination,
Mr. Fry!

191
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:13,196
String him up!

192
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:27,758
Things look bad enough without
having to look closer at them.

193
00:10:32,754 --> 00:10:34,464
Look, off in the distance!

194
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:36,232
It's exhaling!

195
00:10:36,357 --> 00:10:38,054
Use boaty talk!

196
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,140
Thar she blows!

197
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,374
All right, which of you space dogs

198
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:47,843
has the guts and know-how
to harpoon that whale?

199
00:10:47,968 --> 00:10:50,936
I spent a semester in
Africa harpooning giraffes.

200
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,083
And giraffes are basically
just land space whales.

201
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,452
Ms. Wong, you have the 'poon.

202
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:13,506
Oh, God, I'm having
a Serengeti flashback.

203
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,931
Die, you dirty giraffe!

204
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,812
Well, I got it.

205
00:11:21,937 --> 00:11:23,246
Now what, Captain?

206
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:24,934
You know, I'm not sure.

207
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,353
I guess I thought whales died
when you harpooned them.

208
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,618
<i>Don't worry.</i>

209
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,241
I'll drop the anchor.

210
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:41,784
Oh!
Aw! Ouch!

211

She's diving

212
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:47,305
We have to cut the rope.

213
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,706
Negative, Sailor Moon.

214
00:11:48,831 --> 00:11:50,865
We're going for a sleigh ride.

215
00:11:57,373 --> 00:11:59,617
I can see sideways in time.

216
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,587
Hey, I see CGI.

217
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:08,357
Poop.

218
00:12:08,482 --> 00:12:09,896
Poop.

219
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:10,626
Ah, yeah.

We need to cut the line.

235
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,268
Enough of your mad obsession
with Bender, Fry.

236
00:12:50,393 --> 00:12:53,314
We've got to murder
that whale or die trying.

237
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,805
This has gone too far.

238
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,109
Bender's one of Planet Express's
most expensive appliances.

239
00:12:58,234 --> 00:12:59,400
And he's in trouble.

240
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,112
That's it. I warned you.

241
00:13:01,237 --> 00:13:04,907
Fry, Zoidberg, I now pronounce
you man and...

242
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,810
Aw, so close.

243
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,435
Unsit me, Mr. Conrad.

244
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,271
We can't let the whale win.

245
00:13:24,396 --> 00:13:25,830
Hi-- yah!

246
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,641
You're all too weak.

247
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,811
I can see that now.

248
00:13:29,936 --> 00:13:32,146
So I'll have to be my own crew.

249
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:33,380
Understood?

250
00:13:33,505 --> 00:13:34,581
You've gone mad, Captain.

251
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:35,682
That's enough out of me.

252
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:37,174
Now come on,

253
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:38,809
I got to find that whale.

254
00:13:41,312 --> 00:13:42,946
I found him.

255
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:49,527
With my Oxo Good Grips Cheese Knife,

256
00:13:49,652 --> 00:13:50,886
I stab at thee.

257
00:13:54,891 --> 00:13:57,459
You do know I'm stabbing
at thee, right?

258
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:28,701
Hello.

259
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,078
Think, Zoidberg.

260
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:33,206
You must remember something.

261
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,841
No, nothing.

262
00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:36,944
For all I know, our friends
could have been eaten

263
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:38,345
by some kind of crazy space whale.

264
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,421
Damn that Bermuda Tetrahedron.

265
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:43,917
It's taken my latest crew
just as it took my first one.

266
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:45,619
Not to mention

267
00:14:45,744 --> 00:14:47,720
those single socks
from the dryer, am I right?

268
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:49,756
Shut up, Zoidberg.

269
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:51,991
Oh, Zoidberg, the grieving relatives

270
00:14:52,116 --> 00:14:54,644
will be gathered here tomorrow
in need of comfort.

271
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,296
And with no stone monument,
they may well demand

272
00:14:57,421 --> 00:14:59,665
that I refund their admission fees.

273
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,105
Where are we?

274
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,108
In the belly of the beast.

275
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:12,787
Like that Bible guy who got swallowed
by the whale-- Pinocchio.

276
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,115
This is all Obsessy Bessy's fault.

277
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,783
Right on, sister.

278
00:15:16,908 --> 00:15:18,952
We should be back
at Planet Express right now,

279
00:15:19,077 --> 00:15:20,754
hiding from work in the ceiling.

280
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,256
But no!

281
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,924
For the last time, I'm not obsessed.

282
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,994
I just want this whale
to die, die, die!

283
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:34,100
Uh-oh. What's that
loud digesting sound?

284
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,523
Holy crap!
Four dimensional bowels!

285
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,998
Einstein was right.

286
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:53,318
Why?! Why?!

287
00:15:53,443 --> 00:15:55,386
Also what and how?!

288
00:15:55,511 --> 00:15:58,322
The great fish has chosen
you for a higher purpose.

289
00:15:58,447 --> 00:15:59,959
It's a great mammal.

290
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,725
See? It's got whiskers.

291
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,351
And I saw it lactating earlier.

292
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:06,162
Wait, who said that?

293
00:16:06,287 --> 00:16:08,832
I was once Lando Tucker--

294
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:11,325
captain of the first
Planet Express ship.

295
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:12,702
Ew!

296
00:16:12,827 --> 00:16:14,037
I'm Turanga Leela--

297
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:15,972
captain of the current
Planet Express ship.

298
00:16:16,097 --> 00:16:17,364
What's going on?

299
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:18,942
It's very simple.

300
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:21,144
Well, actually it's very complicated.

301
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:23,065
Luckily, I'm here to explain it.

302
00:16:23,231 --> 00:16:27,107
You see, this space whale
feeds on obsession.

303
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:28,952
Wow. Are you gross looking.

304
00:16:29,077 --> 00:16:30,406
Go on.

305
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,055
- The great space serpent...
- Mammal.

306
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,156
...figured out long ago

307
00:16:33,281 --> 00:16:36,016
that no one's more obsessed
than space captains.

308
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:38,328
Oh! Oh!

309
00:16:38,453 --> 00:16:39,729
What are these things?!

310
00:16:39,854 --> 00:16:41,125
Get away!

311
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,966
The whale's nearly sucked me dry.

312
00:16:43,091 --> 00:16:45,796
It'll need a new source
of obsession once I'm gone.

313
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:48,371
How many times do I have
to tell other people--

314
00:16:48,496 --> 00:16:50,509
I'm not obsessed.

315
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:52,710
The whale is obsession, Leela.

316
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:54,388
And you are the whale!

317
00:16:54,554 --> 00:16:56,314
I am not the whale!

318
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:59,084
All I wanted was to complete
my delivery.

319
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:00,686
Is that too much to ask?

320
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,387
One Chicken Pickin' delivery?

321
00:17:02,512 --> 00:17:04,357
This whale's gonna pay.

322
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,293
It can't escape what
it already is-- me!

323
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:09,219
I am the whale!

324
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,239
See?

325
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,214
50 years, Junior.

326
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,918
50 years of crippling sorrow.

327
00:17:33,043 --> 00:17:35,021
Popsicles here. Can't mourn
the dead without a Popsicle.

328
00:17:35,146 --> 00:17:37,790
You think a Popsicle
gonna bring my daughter back?

329
00:17:37,915 --> 00:17:39,308
No, sir.

330
00:17:39,474 --> 00:17:42,329
Aha! You just talked
yourself out of a sale.

331
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:45,799
Poor Amy.

332
00:17:45,924 --> 00:17:48,859
My days of joy and luck are over.

333
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,861
Guess I got to quit that club.

334
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:53,307
I can't believe our Leela's gone.

335
00:17:53,432 --> 00:17:56,993
You always think you're going to disappear
in space before your children.

336
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,503
Welcome, everyone.

337
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:02,123
What a pleasure to see
so many miserable faces.

338
00:18:03,176 --> 00:18:04,887
Mmm! Lemony!

339
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:09,159
I had intended to unveil a
beautiful stone memorial today.

340
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:11,061
But due to the recent tragedy,

341
00:18:11,186 --> 00:18:14,969
I humbly ask you to join me
in a simple prayer.

342
00:18:17,345 --> 00:18:18,336
No refunds!

343
00:18:18,461 --> 00:18:20,016
Shut up and bow your heads!

344
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,264
O, mighty Isis...

345
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,243
Oh, no.
My deal is doing the thing.

346
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:33,717
Good Lord, it's some kind
of interdimensional space whale.

347
00:18:33,842 --> 00:18:36,386
I just remembered, that's the guy.

348
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:40,036
Oy, now with the horror hair.

349
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:05,008
Popsicles. Fill your gaping
mouth with a Popsicle.

350
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,289
Leela, you're alive.

351
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,151
Is that how you and
your friends are dressing now?

352
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,026
Hello, everyone.

353
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,860
I suppose you're wondering

354
00:19:14,985 --> 00:19:17,520
why my flesh has melded with
that of a giant space whale.

355
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:20,156
I'll admit to a polite interest.

356
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,367
At first I was consumed
by a dark obsession

357
00:19:22,492 --> 00:19:23,869
to kill the whale.

358
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:26,082
Then I was consumed by the whale.

359
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,876
That sounds clever,
but it doesn't explain much.

360
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,934
Shut up, Zoidberg.
Okay.

361
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,947
You see, beneath my obsession
lay an even deeper obsession.

362
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:38,250
An obsession so strong,
it allowed me to overpower

363
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,013
the beast's will and pilot it
through space and time.

364
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:44,924
An obsession with completing
my delivery...

365
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:46,416
...delivery, delivery,

366
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,319
delivery, delivery, delivery...

367
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,830
Get your...

368
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:54,968
Poor Lando.

369
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,304
This is just how
I want to remember him.

370
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,331
Too bad, 'cause he's still alive.

371
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:03,500
Lando?

372
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,011
Told you I'd be back.

373
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:06,246
You've grown, Junior.

374
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,165
I'm 61.

375
00:20:08,331 --> 00:20:10,107
I don't know him.
What else you got?

376
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,431
They haven't aged a day.

377
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,434
The whale must have
some kind of Mobius colon

378
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,062
that endlessly recycles
time and space.

379
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,498
Yep. That stands up to scrutiny.

380
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,534
I should have listened to my crew.

381
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,470
That space whale wasn't a monster.

382
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,083
It was the obsession of me
and others like me

383
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,991
that made it into a monster.

384
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,034
Mainly you.

385
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,613
On the other hand,
the stupid fish did eat us.

386
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:49,358
You guys want to do this?

387
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:51,126
Oh, you know it!

388
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,918
So, Johnny,

389
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:54,863
are we going to pick up
where we left off?

390
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:57,423
Eh.

391
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,753
