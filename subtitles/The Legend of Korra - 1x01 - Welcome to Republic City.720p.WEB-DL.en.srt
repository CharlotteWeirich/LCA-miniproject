1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,980
Earth

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,420
Fire

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,100
Air

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,070
Water

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,230
When I was a boy,
my father, Avatar Aang

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,580
told me the story of
how he and his friends

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,810
heroically ended the 100 year war.

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,090
Avatar Aang and Firelord Zuko

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,400
transformed the
Fire Nation colonies

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,370
into the
United Republic of Nations

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,310
a society where benders and
non-benders from all over the world

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,700
would live and thrive together
in peace and harmony

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,150
They named the capital of this
great land Republic City

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,220
Avatar Aang accomplished many
remarkable things in his life

15
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,200
but, sadly, his time in
this world came to an end

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,480
and like the
cycle of the seasons

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,790
the cycle of the
Avatar began anew

18
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,750
The White Lotus has
honored my family by coming

19
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,140
Thank you.

20
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,170
Welcome.

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,380
We have investigated many claims

22
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,310
both here and in the
Northern Tribe

23
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,340
all of them turned out to be false.

24
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,540
Then you should be happy to know,
your search has come to an end.

25
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,980
What makes you so sure
your daughter is...

26
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,990
the one?

27
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,060
Korra! please come in here

28
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,340
I'm the Avatar!
You gotta deal with it!

29
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,660
She's strong.

30
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,730
But she lacks restraint.

31
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,460
Hey! Why all the doom
and gloom, people?

32
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,160
We should be celebrating!

33
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,350
Three elements down, one to go!

34
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,300
You are getting ahead of
yourself as usual, Korrra.

35
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,040
We haven't decided if you
passed your fire bending test yet.

36
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,200
Ever since you were a little girl you
excelled at the physical side of bending

37
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,490
but completely ignored
the spiritual side.

38
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,240
The Avatar must master both.

39
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,880
I haven't ignored it, it just
doesn't come as easy to me.

40
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,640
But that's why I should start
training with Tenzin immediately

41
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,420
he's "Mister Spiritual".

44
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,490
If anyone can teach her
what she needs to learn,

45
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,080
it's Tenzin.

46
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,670
Very well, Korra.

47
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,570
It's time for you to begin
your airbending training

48
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,870
Yes! Finally!

49
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,620
I mean... ahem!

50
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,530
Thank you all for
believing in me.

51
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,370
Naga! You should have seen it.

52
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,690
I kicked some firebending butt,
and I passed!

53
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,330
Tenzin will be
here in a few days.

54
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,470
Just taking Naga out for a stroll.

55
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,620
Don't worry, we're not going far.

56
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,940
Naga, go!

57
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,310
Are we there yet? Are we
there yet? Are we there yet?

58
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,810
It looks like we're there,
I know cause it's very familiar.

59
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,320
Are we here yet?
Are we there yet?

60
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,350
- Ooooh please tell me we're here!
- Yes, Ikki.

61
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,840
As I've been telling you
for the last 15 minutes

62
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,820
we are, FINALLY, here.

63
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,560
Hello, Mother.

64
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,060
I can't tell you how
happy I am to see you.

65
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,210
Please, help me.

66
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,540
Unhand me, strange woman!

67
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,120
That's your grandmother, Milo.

68
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,790
It's so good to see all of you.

69
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,020
Gran Gran, I've been reading
all about your old adventures.

70
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,730
and I've been dying to ask you

71
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,630
What happened to Zuko's mom?

72
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,320
Well, Jinora,
it's an incredible tale.

73
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,120
Gran Gran, you look old.
How old are you?

74
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,580
And why is it so cold in the South Pole?
Can we make a campfire and and all huddle around it

75
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,800
and tell scary stories
and make snowmen?

76
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,480
And then can you make the snowmen
move with Waterbending and chase us?

77
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,930
Wouldn't that be fun? Huh?
Wouldn't it?

78
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,080
Pema, let me help you.

79
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,600
Careful now. Careful.

80
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,370
Stop doting on me.

81
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,330
I'm not helpless

82
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,300
I'm just pregnant!

83
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,990
The baby is strong.

84
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,620
I see another airbender
in your future.

85
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,990
All I want is one child like me!

86
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:14,010
A nice non-bender who doesn't blast
wind at my face every five seconds.

87
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,850
Mommy, look!

88
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,580
I'm a snowbender!

89
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,800
Were Tenzin and his
siblings this crazy

90
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,920
when they were kids?

91
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,840
Kaya and Bumi certainly were

92
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,330
but Tenzin has always been...

93
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,300
rather serious.

94
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,550
Mother... please.

95
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,700
Korra?

96
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,150
Look at you,
so big and strong.

97
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,240
You've grown into
quite the young Avatar.

98
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,040
Master Tenzin,
I'm so glad you're here.

99
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,410
I can't wait to get started.

100
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,730
Yes.. well...

101
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,850
You're going to have to
tell her sooner or later.

102
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,910
Tell me what?

103
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,310
You're not staying, are you?

104
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,070
I'm afraid not.

105
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,970
We're only visiting
for the night.

106
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,780
Then, I have to
return to Republic City.

107
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,620
But... you're suposed to move here!

108
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,800
You're suposed to teach me!

109
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,610
I'm sorry, Korra.

110
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,190
Your airbending training
is going to have to wait.

111
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,970
So, how long until you're
ready to teach me airbending?

112
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,210
A week? A month?

113
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,310
It could be much longer.

114
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,670
I don't understand.

115
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,340
Why are you making me wait?

116
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,550
I have a responsibility to
Republic City.

117
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,170
I'm one of it's leaders,

118
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,860
and the situation there
is very unstable right now.

119
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,150
But you also have a
responsibility to teach me.

120
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,420
Believe me! I'd be happy
to find another airbending master.

121
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,970
But you are the only one.

122
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,790
We're stuck with each other.

123
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,500
I wish there were another way

124
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,090
Wait! there is!

125
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,900
If you can't stay here, then
I'll go back to Republic City with you!

126
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,270
It's perfect!

127
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,900
Absolutely not.

128
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,710
The city is far too dangerous!

129
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,830
Avatar Aang tasked us
with keeping you safe

130
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,640
while you master
the four elements!

131
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,360
I get that, but

132
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,460
I don't think keeping me locked up
in this compound like a prisoner

133
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,270
is what he had in mind.

134
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,410
I know this is difficult to accept

135
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,010
but it's not the right time
for you to come to the city.

136
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,160
Whatever!

137
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,850
Goodbye, Gran Gran!

138
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,250
Hoogie, yip yip.

139
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,880
Nice night for an escape, isn't it?

140
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,040
I have to leave.

141
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,600
I have to find my
own path as the Avatar.

142
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,790
I know you do.

143
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,030
Aang's time has passed.

144
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,840
My brother and many of
my friends are gone.

145
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,910
It's time for you
and your generation

146
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,580
to take over the responsibility
of keeping peace

147
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,560
and balance in the world

148
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,220
and I think you're going
to be a great Avatar.

149
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,180
Thank you.

150
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,760
Goodbye, Korra.

151
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,960
Mom, Dad...

152
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,270
I'll miss you.

153
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,910
We love you so much.

154
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,150
Naga! we're here!

155
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,330
Thanks for the ride!

156
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:39,980
Wow!

157
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,080
Look at this place!

158
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,960
I've never seen so
many Satomobiles!

159
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,070
Airtemple Island

160
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,000
That's were Tenzin is.

161
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,740
Ready for a little swim, girl?

162
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,150
Okay, okay!

163
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,380
Food first, then Airtemple.

164
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,630
Watch it, Naga! Look out!

165
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,380
Excuse us!

166
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,380
Coming through!

167
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,030
Heads up!

168
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,060
Sorry!

169
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,300
Naga, wait.

170
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,280
We'll take one of
everything, please.

171
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,870
That'll be 20 Yuans.

172
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,400
Err... I don't
have any money.

173
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,990
Then what good are you to me!

174
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,120
Don't worry, girl.
The city is huge!

175
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,680
I bet we can find a place

176
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,820
to rustle up something to eat.

177
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,230
Uh... say!

178
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,940
Think I can get one of them
tasty smelling fishies?

179
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,240
Oh! err... Yeah, sure!

180
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,710
You... live in that bush?

181
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,620
Yes! Presently that is
what I do call "home"

182
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,790
Took me a while to
procure a bush that beauty.

183
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,240
This park is quite popular
with all the vagabonds.

184
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,980
So there are a lot
of you out here?

185
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,010
I thought everyone in
this city was living it up?

186
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,870
You got a lot to
learn newcomer.

187
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,670
Welcome to Republic City.

188
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,160
Hey you!

189
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,660
Stop! You can't fish here!

190
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,600
You best skedaddle!

191
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,090
Are you tired of living
under the tyranny of benders?

192
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,730
Then join the Equalists!

193
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,480
For too long the bending elite
of this city have forced

194
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,400
nonbenders to live as
lower class citizens!

195
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Join Amon!

196
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,810
And together we will tear down

197
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,620
the bending establishment!

198
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,610
What are you talking about?

199
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,590
Bending is the coolest
thing in the world!

200
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,990
Oh yeah?

201
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,080
Let me guess

202
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,860
you're a bender.

203
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,860
Yeah, I am.

204
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,680
Then I bet you'd love to just knock me off
this platform with some Waterbending huh?

205
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,650
I'm seriously thinking about it.

206
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,300
This is what's wrong with the City!

207
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,130
Benders like this girl only use
their powers to oppress us!

208
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,460
What?!

209
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,070
I'm not oppressing anyone!

210
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,420
You...

211
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,870
You're oppressing yourselves!

212
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,260
That didn't even make sense!

213
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,590
Excuse me, I think I'm lost.

214
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,460
How do I get to
Air Temple Island from here?

215
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,960
Just head down this street

216
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,420
You should get moving young lady.

217
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,730
It isn't safe!

218
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,760
Mr. Chung,

219
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,460
please tell met
that you have my money

220
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,490
or else I can't guarantee that
I can protect your fine establishment.

221
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,800
I'm sorry! Business has been slow!

222
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,040
Please! Take one of my phonographs.

223
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,930
My friend here is not a music lover.

224
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,170
Give me the money or else

225
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,610
Or else what, hoodlum?

226
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,740
Since you're obviously
fresh off the boat,

227
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,020
let me explain a couple things.

228
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,080
You're in
Triple Threat Triad territory

229
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,570
and we're about to
put you in the hospital.

230
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,940
You're the only ones who
are gonna need a hospital.

231
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,860
And for your sake I
hope there's one near by.

232
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,600
Who do you think you are?

233
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,520
Why don't you come and find out?

234
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,530
- What just happened?
- Did she just Earthbend?

235
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,680
Can she Firebend too?

236
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,050
Could she be...?

237
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,420
Got an idea about who I am now?

238
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,430
Chumps

239
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,750
Come on!

240
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,870
You're not getting away!

241
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,090
Police! Freeze where you are!

242
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,900
Cool, Metalbenders...

243
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,970
I caught the bad guys
for you officers.

244
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,460
Arrest them!

245
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,940
You're under arrest too.

246
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,230
What do you mean I'm under arrest?

247
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,370
Those are the bad guys over there!
They were smashing up a shop.

248
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,220
From the looks of it, you
smashed up a lot more than that.

249
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,970
Wait! You can't arrest me!

250
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,970
Let me explain!

251
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,020
You can explain
yourself all you like

252
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,150
down at headquarters.

253
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,750
Let's see...

254
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,200
Multiple counts of destruction
of private and city property

255
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,740
not to mention resisting arrest.

256
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,760
You're in a whole mess
of trouble young lady.

257
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,400
But they were some thugs
threatening a helpless shopkeeper and I

258
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,390
Can it! You should have called the
police and stayed out of the way.

259
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,560
But I couldn't just
sit by and do nothing.

260
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,600
It's my duty to help people.

261
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,910
See, I'm the Avatar.

262
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,030
Oh, I am well aware
of who you are.

263
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,400
And your Avatar title
might impress some people

264
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,760
but not me.

265
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,000
All right, fine.

266
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,280
Then I want to talk
to whoever's in charge.

267
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,750
You're talking to her.

268
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,490
I'm Chief Bei Fong.

269
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,430
Wait...Bei Fong

270
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,260
Lin Bei Fong?

271
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,430
You're Toph's daughter!

272
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,460
- What of it?
- Well then why are you treating me like a criminal?

273
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,760
Avatar Aang and your
mother were friends,

274
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,700
they saved the world together.

275
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,930
That's ancient history.

276
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,300
And it's got diddlysquat to do
with the mess you're in right now.

277
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,170
You can't just waltz in here and dole out
vigilante justice like you own the place.

278
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:02,900
Chief, Councilman Tenzin is here. You can't just waltz in
here and dole out vigilante justice like you own the place.

279
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,500
Chief, Councilman Tenzin is here.

280
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,780
Let him in.

281
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,490
Tenzin...sorry,

282
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,600
I got a little side tracked
on my way to see you...

283
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,240
Lin you are looking
radiant as usual.

284
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,900
Cut the garbage, Tenzin.

285
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,950
Why is the Avatar in Republic City?

286
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,440
I thought you were supposed to be
moving down to the South Pole to train her.

287
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,900
My relocation has been delayed.

288
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,740
The Avatar, on the other hand, will be
heading back to the South Pole immediately

289
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,170
where she will stay put.

290
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:43,480
- But-
- If you would be so kind as to
drop the charges against Korra

291
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,330
I will take full
responsibility for today's events

292
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,480
and cover all the damages.

293
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,490
Fine, get her out of my city.

294
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,480
Always a pleasure Lin.

295
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,830
Let's go Korra.

296
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,540
Tenzin please

297
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,010
don't send me back home.

298
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,860
You blatantly disobeyed my wishes
and the Order of the White Lotus.

299
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,180
Katara agreed with
me that I should come.

300
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,710
She said my destiny
is in Republic City.

301
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,580
Don't bring my mother into this!

302
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,930
Look, I can't wait any
longer to finish my training.

303
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,820
Being cooped up and hidden away from the world
isn't helping me become a better Avatar.

304
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,590
I saw a lot of the city today

305
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,540
and it's totally out of whack.

306
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,960
I understand now
why you need to stay,

307
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,980
Republic City does need you

308
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,670
but it needs me too.

309
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,360
You...

310
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,790
Is this your
polar bear-dog, miss?

311
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,510
Korra!

312
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,850
Are you coming to live
with us on the island?

313
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,900
No, I'm sorry Ikki.

314
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,030
I have to go home now.

315
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,980
Wait.

316
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,370
I have done my best to
guide Republic City

317
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,310
towards the dream
my father had for it.

318
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,050
But you're right, it has fallen
out of balance since he passed.

319
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,670
I thought I should put off your training
in order to uphold his legacy.

320
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:49,460
But you are his legacy.

321
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,960
You may stay and train
Airbending here with me.

322
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,860
Republic City needs
it's Avatar once again.

323
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,690
Yes! Thank you! You're the best!

324
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,540
Hello...

325
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,570
I'm Korra,

326
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,920
your new Avatar.

327
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,380
Does this mean you've
moved to Republic City?

328
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,000
Were you trying to send a message
to the Triads yesterday?

329
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,490
Will you be fighting crime or the
anti-bending revolution or both?

330
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,990
Will you be working with
Chief Bei Fong and the police?

331
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,850
Uhh...yes I am
definitely here to stay

332
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:39,100
but honestly... I don't
exactly have a plan yet...

333
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,370
See I'm still in training but...

334
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,530
Look,

335
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,530
all I know is Avatar Aang
meant for this city

336
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,780
to be the center of peace
and balance in the world

337
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,210
and

338
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,100
I believe we can make
his dream a reality.

339
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,820
I look forward to serving you!

340
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,840
I'm so happy to be here!

341
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,670
Than you Republic City!

342
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,060
All right that's all
the questions the Av-

343
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,070
Amon, how do you
want to handle this?

344
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,290
So, the Avatar has arrived early.

345
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,240
It looks like we'll have
to accelerate our plans.

346
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,230
"And in the final round the Buzzard Wasps
won with a decisive knockout."

347
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,310
What do you say we
go to the arena tonight?

348
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,850
Catch a few Pro-Bending matches?

349
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:43,960
That sport is a mockery of the
noble tradition of bending.

350
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,850
Come on Tenzin!

351
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:48,320
I dreamed about seeing a
Pro-Bending match since I was a kid

352
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,420
and now I'm just a ferry ride
away from the arena.

353
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,610
Korra, you're not here
to watch that drivel.

354
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,630
You're here to finish
your Avatar training,

355
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:58,020
so for the time being I want
you to remain on the island.

356
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,020
Is that why you're keeping the
White Lotus sentries around

357
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,250
to watch my every move?

358
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,840
Yes. In order to
learn Airbending

359
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,420
I believe you require a
calm, quiet environment

360
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,370
free from any distractions.

361
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,670
Alright.

362
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,940
You're the master.

363
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,780
So

364
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:23,260
my mother informed me you've
never been able to Airbend before.

365
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,790
Yeah but I don't know why.

366
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,860
The other elements
came SO easily to me

367
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,450
but every single time
I've tried Airbending

368
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,210
nothing.

369
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,940
That's perfectly all right.
We just need to be patient.

370
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,590
Often the element that's the most
difficult for the Avatar to master

371
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,890
is the one most opposite
to the Avatar's personality.

372
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,960
For Aang it was Earthbending.

373
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,250
Yeah well, I'm about as opposite
an Airbender as you can get.

374
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,600
Let's begin your first lesson.

375
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,060
Korra's gonna Airbend!
Korra's gonna Airbend!

376
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,960
What is that contraption.

377
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,740
A time-honored tool

378
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,630
that teaches the most
fundamental aspect of Airbending.

379
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,170
Jinora would you like
to explain this exercise.

380
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,630
The goal is to weave your
way through the gates

381
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,610
and make it to the other side
without touching them.

382
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,740
Seems easy enough.

383
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,680
Jinora forgot to say you have to make
it through while the gates are spinning.

384
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,080
The key is to be like the leaf.

385
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,580
Flow

386
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,160
with the movement of the gates.

387
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,450
Jinora will demonstrate.

388
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,130
Airbending is all
about spiral movements.

389
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,660
When you meet resistance

390
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,950
you must be able to switch
direction at a moment's notice.

391
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,730
Let's do this.

392
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,250
Don't force your way through!

393
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,120
Dance! Dance like the wind!

394
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,920
Be the leaf!

395
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,700
Airbend!

396
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,130
What is wrong with me?

397
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,960
Airbend!

398
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,350
Maybe I'm just not cut out
to be an Airbender, huh, Naga?

399
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,600
Ladies and gentlemen!
I'm coming to you live

400
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,810
from Republic City's
Pro-Bending arena

401
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,820
where tonight the
best in the world

402
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,750
continue their quest for a spot in
the upcoming championship tournament.

403
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,900
Grab your snacks
and grab your kids

404
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,840
because this next match
is gonna be a doozy!

405
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,150
This Mako's got moxy!

406
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,200
He fires to quick shots.

407
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,510
Yomo is hammered
back to zone 3.

408
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,740
Clock is winding down,
can Yomo hold on?

409
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,450
He's teetering on the
edge of the ring now.

410
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,700
The Fire Ferrets—

411
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,950
Korra come down here, please.

412
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,660
You shut it off at the best part!

413
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,620
I thought I made myself clear,

414
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,920
I don't want you listening to
this distracting nonsense

415
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,500
But it's their radio.

416
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,590
And technically you said I couldn't watch a match.
You didn't say anything about listening to one.

417
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,500
You...-

418
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,370
you know what I meant.

419
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,810
Anyway shouldn't you-

420
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:39,810
shouldn't you be in bed by now!

421
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,580
I think I'm doing it wrong.

422
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,060
There's nothing to do.

423
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,550
Let your mind and
your spirit be free

424
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,790
for Air is the
element of freedom.

425
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,220
Is something funny?

426
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,490
Yeah, you're telling me to embrace freedom
but you won't even let me listen to the radio.

427
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,890
And forget about leaving this island.

428
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:21,030
Please Korra. Look at Meelo.

429
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,780
He's able to meditate peacefully.

430
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,680
Actually, I think he's asleep.

431
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,430
What?

432
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:31,390
Well, at least he has
the relaxing part down.

433
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,460
Whatever,

434
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,680
none of this Airbending stuff
makes any sense to me.

435
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,180
I know you're frustrated

436
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,500
but these teachings
will sink in over time

437
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,880
then one day

438
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,650
they'll just click.

439
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,780
Yeah it's not sinking in yet.

440
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,660
I'm gonna go get a
glass of leechee juice.

441
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,670
Korra!

442
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,160
The meditation's not over yet!

443
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,700
Daddy can I have
some leechee juice too?

444
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,900
No.

445
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,760
Hey!

446
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,450
What are you doing in my gym?

447
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,470
I was just looking for a
bathroom and I got lost.

448
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,410
Oh the old "I had to pee excuse".

449
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,640
You know, I'm sick and tired of
you kids sneaking in without paying.

450
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm taking you to security.

451
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,900
- No wait...!
- There you are!

452
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,980
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

453
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,100
It's alright Toza, she's with me.

454
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,230
Yeah, I'm with him.

455
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,230
So you see, we're together.

456
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,170
Well not "together together",

457
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:30,210
more like friends.
- Right friends, no, no I didn't mean to imply...

458
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,210
Oh you implied it.

459
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,910
I don't care what you are!

460
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:33,980
I've got work to do.

461
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,990
Right this way miss.

462
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,870
Why thank you sir.

463
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,950
Seriously thanks.

464
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,650
What do you think?

465
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,780
Best seats in the house, huh?

466
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,330
Whoa...

467
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,310
Unbelievable!

468
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:54,710
this place is even more amazing
than I imagined.

469
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,490
Name's Bolin, by the way.

470
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,780
Korra

471
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,700
- Pssst, Bolin!
- Yeah?

472
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,160
I told you, you have to stop bringing your
crazy fangirls in here before the matches.

473
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,790
Get her out of here.

474
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,100
Ah come on Mako!

475
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,170
I kinda promised her,
she could stay

476
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,160
but man I got a good feeling.
There's something special about her

477
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,360
I know it. Come here, I want
you to meet my brother

478
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,930
Mako

479
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:20,930
Mako?

480
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,220
Wow I heard you
play on the radio.

481
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,280
Come on Bolin we're up.

482
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,010
Or I could meet him later.

483
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,410
Yeah. Sorry about that.

484
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:31,290
My brother gets real
focused before a match.

485
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,470
Well I gotta go.

486
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,950
Wish me luck.

487
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,470
Not that I'll need it.

488
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,490
Good luck!

489
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,000
Knock 'em out!

490
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,140
Introducing the Fire Ferrets!

491
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,560
Ahhhh!! I love you Bolin.

492
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,190
The rookie Ferrets
came out of nowhere

493
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,750
and have made it further
than anyone expected this season.

494
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,750
But tonight they face
their toughest test yet folks.

495
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,950
And they're off.

496
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,630
The two teams waste no time

497
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,950
trying to blast each
other out of zone 1.

498
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,300
Hasook is the first to feel
the heat of the Tigerdilloes,

499
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,460
he tries to return the favor
but they're too fast for him.

500
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,590
While Mako showcases his trademark
cool under fire style.

501
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,710
And the Tigerdilloes score
with a walloping one-two combo.

502
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:31,740
Can their teammate...

503
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,290
Guess not.

504
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,580
Mako's over the line.

505
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,010
The Tigerdilloes get the green line
and advance into Ferret territory.

506
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,400
Come on, Ferrets!

507
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,800
Look's like Hasook's
in trouble.

508
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,090
He's in zone 3 teetering
over the drink.

509
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,680
And Hasook takes a dip.

510
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,410
He'll be back for round two.

511
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,440
Assuming the fabulous bending brothers
can hold their ground until he next round.

512
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:07,790
Round 1 goes to the
Golden Temple Tigerdilloes!

513
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,410
Come on, Hasook
get your act together!

514
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:18,910
The Fire Ferrets are knocked into zone 2
and the Tigerdilloes advance.

515
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,250
The Fire Ferrets sinch the round
in the closing seconds.

516
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:44,280
That's one a piece. Still anyone's match
as we go into the third and final round.

517
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,520
Hasook stumbles

518
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,380
and now he tumbles right
into his teammate.

519
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,210
He and Bolin better untangle quick
if they don't want to—

520
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,750
Oh too late!

521
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:56,760
Oh no!

522
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,830
It's all up to Mako now,

523
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,750
he's bobbing and weaving,

524
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,390
but he's not hitting back!

525
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:06,670
If he's knocked out the
Ferrets' fabulous season is over.

526
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,950
He is dancing on the
edge of the ring

527
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,870
withstanding the
three on one barrage.

528
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:15,340
It seems his plan is to let the
Tigerdilloes punch themselves out.

529
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,080
And his plan is working.

530
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,540
Han is in the pool!

531
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,900
They've got nothing left in the tank
and Mako's on the offensive!

532
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,840
It's two on one,

533
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,510
scratch that it's one on one.

534
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,140
And it's an Earth and Fire slugfest!

535
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:34,500
There's so much smoke and dust
I can't even see where the Fire Ferret is.

536
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,850
It's a knock out!

537
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:42,350
What a win they had a hat trick folks!

538
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:47,160
Mako pulls off the upset of the season
winning the match for the Fire Ferrets!

539
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:56,900
Yes!

540
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,190
One more win and we're in
the championship tournament!

541
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,160
So, what'd ya think Korra?

542
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,230
Bolin's got some moves, huh?

543
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,710
What did I think?

544
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,370
That was amazing!

545
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,560
You did more harm
than good out there.

546
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,080
You almost cost us the match.

547
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,570
We won didn't we?

548
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,450
- Barely
- Get off my case pal.

549
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,440
Useless.

550
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,500
You guys were
incredible out there.

551
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,980
Especially you Mr. Hatrick.

552
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,530
Oh you're still here...

553
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,980
Oh you're still a jerk...

554
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:30,890
anyway,

555
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,920
I've been immersed in
bending my entire life

556
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,820
but I never learned
to move like that.

557
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,920
It's like there's a
whole new style here.

558
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,830
Think you could
show me a few tricks?

559
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,040
Absolutely!

560
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,150
Right now?

561
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,870
Come on Bolin.

562
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,070
Just ignore him.

563
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,300
Yeah I could show you the basics.

564
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:50,670
I'm just not sure how my Earthbending
would translate to your Waterbending

565
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,800
but we'll figure it out.

566
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,850
Won't be a problem,
I'm actually an Earthbender.

567
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:57,840
I'm sorry! No, no
I didn't mean to assume—

568
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,110
I was just figuring,
with your Water Tribe get up

569
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:04,180
that you are a Water Tribe gal.

570
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,720
No you're right.
I'm a Waterbender

571
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,000
and a Firebender.

572
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,500
Hmm... uhhmm.
I'm very confused right now.

573
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,990
You're the Avatar

574
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,510
and I'm an idiot.

575
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,030
Both are true.

576
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,830
No... way...

577
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,910
The Avatar!

578
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,730
Alright. Let's see what you got.

579
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,370
That was great!

580
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,520
Good power!

581
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,800
But in a real match you'd
be a sitting turtleduck.

582
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,630
Not so upright and flatfooted.

583
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,180
Stay light on your toes
up until the moment

584
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,370
when you need to dig in and strike.

585
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,360
Then—

586
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:48,100
Okay, let me try it again.

587
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,180
Wow! Nice adjustment.

588
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,920
You're a natural at this!

589
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,280
- Not bad.
- What's it take

590
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,030
to impress this guy?

591
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:02,110
What? I said not bad.

592
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,420
You know what, it's getting late.

593
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,160
I think I'm gonna turn in.
You kids have fun.

594
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,620
Nice to meet you, Avatar Korra.

595
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,460
Yeah, real pleasure.

596
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,720
See you upstairs bro.

597
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,790
Upstairs? You guys live here?

598
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,470
Yeah, in the attic.

599
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,720
It's nothing fancy

600
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,010
but we have great views.

601
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,020
But back to bending.

602
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,070
Why don't you throw
that combination one more time.

603
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,070
Patience Korra!

604
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:55,190
That was a 2000-year-old
historical treasure...

605
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,000
what...

606
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,460
what is wrong with you?!

607
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,860
There's nothing wrong with me!

608
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,180
I've been practicing
just like you taught me!

609
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,200
But it isn't sinking in okay!

610
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,290
It hasn't clicked
like you said it would!

611
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,650
Korra this isn't
something you can force.

612
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,480
If you would only listen to me...

613
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,800
I have been!
But you know what I think?

614
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,900
Maybe the problem isn't me,

615
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,110
maybe the reason I haven't
learned Airbending yet

616
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,310
is because you're
a terrible teacher.

617
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,810
Yeah you're a terrible teacher, Daddy!

618
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,480
Okay!

619
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,570
Everyone here?

620
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:39,670
Wait...

621
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,100
where's Korra?

622
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,620
Honestly Pema, I am at my
wit's end with that girl.

623
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,490
I don't know how to
get through to her.

624
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:50,150
Dear, the best thing
you can do right now

625
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,100
is to give Korra some space.

626
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,390
You must promise me that your
teenage years won't be like this.

627
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,870
I will make no such promises.

628
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,030
I didn't miss your match did I?

629
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,830
You guys look like
you lost already.

630
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:12,640
- We might as well have.
- Hasook's a no good no show.

631
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,890
You got two minutes
to come out ready to play

632
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,550
or you're disqualified.

633
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,990
Well there goes our shot
at the tournament

634
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,920
and the winnings.

635
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,680
Couldn't you ask one of
those guys to fill in?

636
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,710
Nah, the rules say you can
only compete on one team.

637
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,390
Well then... how about me?

638
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:31,110
I'm a topnotch Waterbender

639
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,550
if I do say so myself.

640
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,490
But you're the Avatar...

641
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,860
isn't that cheating?

642
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,740
It isn't cheating if
I only do Waterbending.

643
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,560
No way.
I'd rather forfeit

644
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,070
than look like a
fool out there.

645
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,430
Wow

646
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,960
thanks for the
vote of confidence...

647
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,430
Time's up
you in or out?

648
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,230
- We're in.
- We are?

649
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,310
- Yes!
- Hey, I didn't agree to this!

650
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,820
You can thank me later.

651
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,610
This girl is crazy...

652
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,180
Looks like the Fire Ferrets

653
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:56,450
have ferreted out a last
minute replacement Waterbender.

654
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,090
Let's see if she's another
diamond in the rough

655
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,790
like the brothers
from the school of hard knocks.

656
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,430
Don't do anything too fancy
or aggressive.

657
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,090
In fact, don't do anything.

658
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:07,180
Just try not to get knocked
off the ring.

659
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,810
You got it captain.

660
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,520
Players

661
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,720
are you ready?

662
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,590
Whoo! Man overboard!

663
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,710
Fire Ferret Waterbender penalty,

664
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,510
move back one zone.

665
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,370
What? Why?

666
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,920
You're only allowed to knock
players off the back of the ring,

667
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,460
not over the sides.

668
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,740
Oh...whoops.

669
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,930
And we're back in action

670
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:40,930
after that hiccup. But I'm not so sure this
replacement player knows what she's doing.

671
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,700
Foul! Over the line!

672
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,360
Move back to zone three.

673
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,800
Ugh! I'll show you over the line.

674
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,990
The Platypus Bears take round 1.

675
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,740
The Platypus Bears know a
green player when they see one

676
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,170
and they are focusing the brunt
of their bending on this poor girl.

677
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,720
What a minute,

678
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,790
did that Waterbender
just Earthbend?

679
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,280
Foul!

680
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,800
I think.

681
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,970
Did I see that right?

682
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,690
Hold on folks we're just waiting
for the Referee's official call

683
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:23,480
but I think this replacement
player could be...

684
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,320
Pardon me everyone, has
anyone seen Korra this evening?

685
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,790
She's not in her room.

686
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,300
You've gotta be kidding me!

687
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,440
She's the Avatar, folks

688
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,350
playing in a Pro-Bending match!

689
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:34,000
Can you believe that?

690
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,410
I'll get her myself!

691
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,730
The Avatar will be
permitted to continue

692
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:43,130
so long as she solely bends water.

693
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:50,320
This girl may be the Avatar
but she's no Pro-Bender

694
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,360
and the Platypus Bears are intent
on exploiting that weakness.

695
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,210
They're giving her their best

696
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:57,610
and her best ain't
good enough to stop it.

697
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,160
Aaaaaannd...-

698
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,170
she's in the drink.

699
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,870
Oh hey Tenzin...

700
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:12,700
I thought you didn't like
coming to these matches.

701
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,850
Once again you have
flagrantly disobeyed my orders.

702
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,610
You were to stay on the island.

703
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:19,610
Let's go.

704
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,150
No!

705
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:22,180
I'm kind of in the
middle of something.

706
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,260
I have tried my very best
to get through to you

707
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,110
by being gentle and patient

708
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,140
But clearly the only thing
you respond to is force.

709
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,100
So I am ordering you to come
back to the temple. Right now!

710
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:36,560
Why? So I can sit around and meditate
about how bad I am at Airbending?

711
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,120
You know I'm beginning to think there's
a reason I haven't been able to learn it,

712
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,280
because maybe I don't
even need it!

713
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,460
What!?

714
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,210
That is a ludicrous suggestion!

715
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:48,580
The Avatar needs to learn
Airbending, it is not optional!

716
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,120
No, THIS is what I need to learn!

717
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,820
Modern styles of fighting!

718
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,490
Being Avatar isn't all
about fighting, Korra!

719
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,390
When will you learn that?

720
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,080
I have a match to go finish.

721
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,570
The Platypus Bears win round 2!

722
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:03,720
Round 3!
The Platypus Bears win round 2!

723
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,180
Round 3!

724
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:14,870
The Platypus Bears come out of the gate
and quickly go after the Ferret brothers.

725
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:19,910
They're corralled in the corner, wedged in the edge
of zone 1 unable to come to the Avatar's rescue

726
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:21,760
and boy does she need it.

727
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:31,330
Looks like the Avatar's Pro-Bending
debut is gonna be cut short

728
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:35,240
as she's pushed back to zone 3
and the water is calling her name.

729
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,500
It's only a matter of time before—

730
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,220
Hold the phone, stop the presses!
She's still in the game folks!

731
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,300
And she's moving like an
entirely different player!

732
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:47,370
All of a sudden the Platypus Bear
strikes are only striking air.

733
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,600
How about that...

734
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,940
The Platypus Bears
have no juice left

735
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,320
but Mako and Bolin are
still fresh and juicy.

736
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:22,740
Knockout!

737
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,390
The Fire Ferrets come from
way behind and steal the win!

738
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:30,460
What an upset folks!
The rookies, Avatar in tow,

739
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,750
have nabbed a place in
the championship tournament!

740
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,160
I cannot believe it!

741
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,980
Korra, what can I say?

742
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,740
You really came alive
in that last round.

743
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,750
The way you dodged
their attacks...

744
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,170
you are a natural.

745
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:49,200
Thanks

746
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,750
but I can't take
all the credit,

747
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,660
someone else taught
me those moves.

748
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:02,500
I'm really sorry

749
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,700
about everything I said.

750
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,860
I was really frustrated
with myself and

751
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,620
I took it out on you.

752
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,870
I think I owe you
an apology too.

753
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:13,210
I was trying to teach
you about patience

754
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,910
but I lost mine.

755
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,560
No hard feelings?

756
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,560
Of course not.

757
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:20,250
By the way, you were really
good out there tonight.

758
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,530
You moved, just like an Airbender.

759
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,950
Wait?! You stayed and watched?

760
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:28,990
I did. Pro-Bending turned out to be
the perfect teaching tool for you.

761
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:35,360
I'll see you tomorrow for
Airbending practice bright and early!

762
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,770
And by the way I kinda
permanently joined the Fire Ferrets

763
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:40,460
and we're playing in the tournament
in a couple of weeks!
