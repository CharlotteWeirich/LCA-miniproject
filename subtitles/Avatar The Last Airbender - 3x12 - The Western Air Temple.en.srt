1
00:00:01,377 --> 00:00:03,169
Water

2
00:00:03,773 --> 00:00:05,169
Earth

3
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:06,969
Fire

4
00:00:08,293 --> 00:00:09,377
Air

5
00:00:10,388 --> 00:00:13,855
Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony

6
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:17,383
then everything changed when the fire nation attacked

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:22,742
Only the avatar mastered all four elements could stop them

8
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:26,354
but when the world needed him most he vanished

9
00:00:26,976 --> 00:00:30,065
100 years passed, my brother and I discovered the new avatar

10
00:00:30,275 --> 00:00:32,086
an airbender named Aang

11
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:35,510
And although his airbending skill is great,

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,199
he has a lot to learn before he is ready to save anyone.

13
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:41,432
but I believe...
...Aang can save the world

14
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:49,545
Previously on
Avatar...

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,448
You and Sokka have to go with Aang somewhere safe

16
00:00:52,543 --> 00:00:54,651
it's the only way to keep hope alive.

17
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:58,482
I'm going to join the Avatar,
and I'm going to help him defeat you.

18
00:00:58,896 --> 00:01:03,116
Since you're a full blown traitor now
and you want me gone, why wait?

19
00:01:03,222 --> 00:01:04,724
Because I know my own destiny.

20
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,239
Taking you down is the Avatar's destiny.

21
00:01:07,648 --> 00:01:10,265
I know just the place for us to go where we'll be safe for a while.

22
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,282
The Western Air Temple.

23
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,724
Book Three: Fire
Chapter Twelve: The Western Air Temple

24
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,619
This is humiliating.

25
00:01:39,035 --> 00:01:40,743
Do you mean getting thoroughly spanked by the Fire Nation,

26
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:43,543
or having to walk all the way to the Western Air Temple?

27
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:45,355
Both.

28
00:01:45,763 --> 00:01:49,378
Sorry guys, but Appa gets tired carrying all these people.

29
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:53,732
I wonder how the rest of the troops are.

30
00:01:53,838 --> 00:01:55,646
They're probably on their way to a prisson.

31
00:01:55,854 --> 00:01:58,871
Seems like my dad just got out,
now he's going back in.

32
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:01,689
I miss Pipsqueak.

33
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:04,324
I miss not having blisters on my feet.

34
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:09,554
Hey! We're here! I can feel it.

35
00:02:11,073 --> 00:02:13,801
Uhh... I think your feet need their eyes checked...

36
00:02:15,313 --> 00:02:18,015
No, she's right. We're here.

37
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:24,052
Wow! It's amazing!

38
00:03:00,518 --> 00:03:02,837
What a stunning view!

39
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:06,542
The only view I'm interested in seeing
is the Avatar in chains.

40
00:03:07,882 --> 00:03:12,607
You know the Avatar hasn't been seen
for a hundred years.

41
00:03:13,137 --> 00:03:17,058
The chances of finding him here are very slim.

42
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,062
First we'll check each of the Air Temples.

43
00:03:19,062 --> 00:03:20,164
Then we'll scour the world,

44
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:23,219
searching even the most remote
locations until we find him.

45
00:03:23,277 --> 00:03:24,586
Prince Zuko,

46
00:03:25,094 --> 00:03:28,206
it's only been a week since your banishment.

47
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:32,390
You should take some time to heal and rest.

48
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:36,829
What else would I expect to hear from
the laziest man in the Fire Nation.

49
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,770
The only way to regain my honor is
to find the Avatar...

50
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:44,194
so I will.

51
00:04:06,806 --> 00:04:09,006
It's so different from the Nothern Air Temple.

52
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:11,413
I wonder if there are any secret rooms.

53
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,599
Let's go check it out.

54
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:21,844
You guys go. I think we need to talk
about some things.

55
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:24,760
I'll race you Duke.

56
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:27,525
I told you, is The Duke!

57
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:29,048
Why can't I go?

58
00:04:29,048 --> 00:04:31,385
We need to decide what we're gunna do now,

59
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:34,185
and since you're the Avatar
maybe you should be a part of this.

60
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:37,770
Fair enough.

61
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:39,894
So, what's the new plan?

62
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:41,489
Well, if you ask me,

63
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:44,628
the new plan... is the old plan.

64
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:49,157
You just need to master all four elements and confront the Fire Lord before the commet comes.

65
00:04:49,157 --> 00:04:50,960
Oh, yeah. That's great.

66
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,496
No problem. I'll just do that.

67
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:56,385
Aang, no one said it's gunna be easy.

68
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:58,708
Well, it's not even going to be possible.

69
00:04:58,786 --> 00:05:01,524
Where am I supposed to get
a firebending teacher?

70
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:03,839
We could look for Jeong Jeong.

71
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:08,636
Yeah, right. Like we'll ever run into Jeong Jeong again.

72
00:05:08,835 --> 00:05:09,639
Who's...

73
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:13,255
Oh... never mind. If it's important I'll find out.

74
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,292
Oh well, guess we can't come up with anybody.

75
00:05:16,294 --> 00:05:18,311
Why don't we just take a nice tour
around the temple?

76
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:23,971
What's up with him?

77
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:28,411
There's got to be someone who can teach him firebending.

78
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,104
Hello,

79
00:05:33,104 --> 00:05:34,100
Zuko here.

80
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,209
But I guess you probably already know me,

81
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,123
sort of... uh.

82
00:05:38,144 --> 00:05:42,363
So, the thing is, I have a lot of
fire-bending experience

83
00:05:42,364 --> 00:05:44,200
and I'm considered to be pretty good at it.

84
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,446
Well you've seem me...

85
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,092
you know, when I was attacking you...

86
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:50,701
Uh, yeah, I guess I should apologize for that.

87
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:52,814
B...but anyway... I'm good now.

88
00:05:53,122 --> 00:05:54,426
I mean I thought I was good before

89
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,952
but now I realize I was bad...

90
00:05:57,359 --> 00:06:02,886
But anyway...
I think it's time I joined your
group and taught the Avatar firebending.

91
00:06:08,611 --> 00:06:11,116
Well, what's your answer!

92
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:15,223
Yeah, that's what I'd say too.

93
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:19,764
How am I supposed to convince these people I'm on their side!?

94
00:06:20,275 --> 00:06:21,469
What would uncle do?

95
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:28,426
Zuko, you have to look within yourself to save yourself from your other self.

96
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:34,053
Only then will your true self reveal itself.

97
00:06:37,378 --> 00:06:39,881
Even when I'm talking for him I can't figure out what he means.

98
00:06:40,097 --> 00:06:41,401
What would Azula do?

99
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:49,644
Listen Avatar, I can join your group or I
can do something unspeakably horrible
to you and your friends.

100
00:06:49,654 --> 00:06:51,544
Your choice.

101
00:06:52,363 --> 00:06:54,780
I guess I'm not that good at impersonations.

102
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:11,070
Aang, can we talk about you learning firebending now?

103
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:17,000
What? The wind is too loud in my ears.
Check out this loop.

104
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:25,039
Aang, I think we should be making some plans about our future.

105
00:07:25,543 --> 00:07:29,548
Okay. We can do that while I show you
the giant Pai Sho table.

106
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,561
Oh, your gunna love the all-day echo chamber.

107
00:07:32,774 --> 00:07:34,479
I think that'll have to wait.

108
00:07:41,103 --> 00:07:43,613
Hello, Zuko here.

109
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:54,903
Hey, I heard you guys flying around down there so... I just thought I'd wait for you here.

110
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:07,692
I know you must be surprised to see me here.

111
00:08:07,895 --> 00:08:10,704
Not really, since you followed us all over the world.

112
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:15,146
Right... Well, uh, anyway...

113
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,572
What I wanted to tell you...about is that I've changed.

114
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:21,095
And I, uh, I'm good now.

115
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:23,828
And, well I think I should join your group.

116
00:08:24,043 --> 00:08:27,251
Oh, and I can teach firebending, to you.

117
00:08:29,763 --> 00:08:30,971
See, I, uh...

118
00:08:31,164 --> 00:08:32,683
You wanna what now?

119
00:08:32,782 --> 00:08:35,803
You can't possibly think that any of us would trust you, can you!?

120
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:37,811
I mean how stupid do you think we are?

121
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:41,030
Yeah, all you've ever done is try to hunt
us down and capture Aang.

122
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,223
I've done some good things.

123
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:47,290
I mean, I could have stolen your bison in Ba Sing Se, but I set him free.

124
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:48,617
That's something.

125
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:53,041
Appa does seem to like him.

126
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:58,173
He probably just covered himself in
honey or something so that Appa would
lick him. I'm not buying it.

127
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,185
I could understand why you wouldn't
trust me, and I know I've made some
mistakes in the past...

128
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:04,812
Like when you attacked our village.

129
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:08,725
Or when you stole my mother's necklace and used it to track us down and capture us.

130
00:09:09,024 --> 00:09:12,240
Look, I admit I've done some awful things.

131
00:09:12,641 --> 00:09:16,843
I was wrong to try to capture you, and
I'm sorry that I attacked the Water Tribe.

132
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:19,236
And I never should have sent that Fire Nation assassin after you.

133
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:21,014
I'm gunna try to stop...

134
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:23,314
Wait! You sent Combustion Man after us!

135
00:09:23,619 --> 00:09:25,523
Well, that's not his name, but...

136
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,734
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to insult your friend.

137
00:09:29,037 --> 00:09:30,343
He's not my friend.

138
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:34,274
That guy locked me and Katara in jail and tried to blow us all up!

139
00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:37,701
Why aren't you saying anything?

140
00:09:38,506 --> 00:09:41,017
You once said you thought we could be friends.

141
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:44,241
You know I have good in me.

142
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:52,177
There's no way we can trust you after everything you've done.

143
00:09:52,182 --> 00:09:54,192
We'll never let you join us.

144
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:57,048
You need to get out of here, now!

145
00:10:00,388 --> 00:10:03,303
I'm trying to explain that I'm not that person anymore.

146
00:10:03,596 --> 00:10:05,512
Either you leave, or we attack.

147
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:11,435
If you won't accept me as a friend, then maybe you'll take me as a prisoner.

148
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:12,990
No, we won't!

149
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,928
Get out of here and don't come back.

150
00:10:17,224 --> 00:10:21,770
And if we ever see you again...
well, we'd better not see you again.

151
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,670
Ugh. I can't believe how stupid I am.

152
00:10:40,764 --> 00:10:44,381
I mean, what was I thinking, telling them
I sent an assassin after them.

153
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:49,136
Why didn't I just say Azula did that?
They would have believed that. Stupid.

154
00:10:56,547 --> 00:10:58,568
Why would he try to fool us like that?

155
00:10:58,577 --> 00:11:01,200
Obviously he wants to lead us into some kind of trap.

156
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,623
This is just like when we were in prison together in Ba Sing Se.

157
00:11:04,814 --> 00:11:09,445
He starts talking about his mother and making it seem like he's an actual human being with feelings.

158
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:14,773
He wants you to trust him and feel sorry for him so you let your guard down. Then he strikes.

159
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:19,285
The thing is, it worked. I did feel sorry for him.

160
00:11:19,704 --> 00:11:22,490
I felt like he was really confused and hurt.

161
00:11:22,922 --> 00:11:28,005
But, obviously when the time came he made his choice, and we paid the price.

162
00:11:28,477 --> 00:11:30,312
We can't trust him.

163
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,234
I kind of have a confession to make. Remember when you two were sick and I got captured by Zhao?

164
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,845
And you made us suck on frozen frogs. How could I forget?

165
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,051
I had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month.

166
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,468
Sokka, I looked at it and told you there was nothing there.

167
00:11:46,966 --> 00:11:50,080
I could feel it. It's my throat-hole flap.

168
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:54,403
Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up it was Zuko who came in and got me out.

169
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,712
He risked his life to save me.

170
00:11:57,001 --> 00:12:00,721
No way. I'm sure he only did it so he
could capture you himself.

171
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:04,080
Yeah, face it Aang. You're nothing but a big prize to him.

172
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,280
You're probably right.

173
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,370
And what was all that crazy stuff about setting Appa free? What a liar.

174
00:12:09,572 --> 00:12:11,387
Actually, he wasn't lying.

175
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:17,210
Oh, hurray. In a lifetime of evil at least he didn't add animal cruelty to the list.

176
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:23,434
I'm just saying... that considering his messed up family and how he was raised, he could have turned out a lot worse.

177
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:27,678
You're right Toph. Let's go find him and give him a medal.

178
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,877
The not as much of a jerk as you could have been award.

179
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,709
All I know is that while he was talking to us he was sincere.

180
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:38,708
Maybe you're all just letting your hurt feelings keep you from thinking clearly.

181
00:12:38,874 --> 00:12:42,416
Easy for you to say! You weren't there when he had us attacked by pirates...

182
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:44,680
Or when he burned down Kyoshi Island...

183
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,939
Or when he tried to capture me
at the fire temple.

184
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,661
Why would you even try to defend him!?

185
00:12:49,738 --> 00:12:53,686
Because, Katara, you're all ignoring one crucial fact.

186
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,687
Aang needs a firebending teacher.

187
00:12:56,687 --> 00:12:59,813
We can't think of a single person in the world to do the job,

188
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:03,981
now one shows up on a silver platter and you won't even think about it!

189
00:13:06,522 --> 00:13:08,647
I'm not having Zuko as my teacher.

190
00:13:09,842 --> 00:13:11,654
You're darn right you're not buddy.

191
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,684
Well, I guess that's settled.

192
00:13:14,065 --> 00:13:17,987
Urrg! I'm beginning to wonder who's
really the blind one around here.

193
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,069
Who's there? Stay back!

194
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,033
It's me.

195
00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:37,077
You burned my feet!

196
00:13:37,457 --> 00:13:39,199
I'm sorry! It was a mistake!

197
00:13:40,364 --> 00:13:41,711
Get away from me!

198
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,231
Let me help you. I'm sorry.

199
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,148
Get off me! Get off me!

200
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:59,054
I didn't know it was you. Come back!

201
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:05,786
Gaww! Why am I so bad at being good!?

202
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,445
Has anyone seen Toph?

203
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,153
I haven't seen her since she stormed off yesterday.

204
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:23,656
Maybe she's just exploring the air temple.

205
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:26,373
There are some pretty fun spots to practice earthbending.

206
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,967
I think we should go look for her.

207
00:14:29,017 --> 00:14:30,980
Aah, let her have fun with her rocks.

208
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:33,300
I'm in no rush to have her yelling at us again.

209
00:14:33,303 --> 00:14:34,618
We can go check for her.

210
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:38,232
Yeah, I want to ride that tunnel down at the hall of statues again.

211
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:40,348
It'll work a lot better now that I fixed my breaks.

212
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,878
Toph, what happened?

213
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:54,591
My feet got burned.

214
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:56,704
Oh, no! What happened?

215
00:14:56,859 --> 00:15:00,430
I just told you, my feet got burned.

216
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,131
I meant how.

217
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,634
Well, I kind of went to see Zuko last night.

218
00:15:04,794 --> 00:15:06,034
You what!

219
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:06,871
Zuko!

220
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,539
Aah!

221
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,533
I just thought he could be helpful to us, and,

222
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:13,493
if I talked to him maybe we could work something out.

223
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,120
So he attacked you.

224
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,678
Well, he did and he didn't.

225
00:15:17,678 --> 00:15:19,520
It was sort of an accident.

226
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,369
But he did firebend at you.

227
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:23,193
Yes.

228
00:15:23,912 --> 00:15:28,356
See, you trusted Zuko and you got burned. Literally.

229
00:15:28,424 --> 00:15:32,504
It's gunna take a while for your feet to
get better. I wish I could've worked
on them sooner.

230
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:33,724
Yeah, me too.

231
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:38,164
Zuko's clearly too dangerous to be left alone. We're gunna have to go after him.

232
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:40,840
I hate to go looking for a fight, but you're right.

233
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,881
After what he did to Toph, I don't think
we have a choice.

234
00:15:44,262 --> 00:15:46,891
He's crafty but we'll find a way to capture him.

235
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:48,808
Maybe just invite him back here.

236
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:51,414
He's already offered himself up as a prisoner once.

237
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:55,733
Yeah... Get him to come back, and say he'll be our prisoner,

238
00:15:55,733 --> 00:16:00,263
then we'll jump him and really make him our prisoner. He'll never suspect it.

239
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,965
You are a master of surprise Sokka.

240
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:07,910
Aah, that's the stuff.

241
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:10,501
Now I know how the rest of you guys feel.

242
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:12,888
Not being able to see with your feet stinks.

243
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:48,921
Stop! I don't want you hunting the Avatar anymore.

244
00:16:50,235 --> 00:16:53,449
The mission is off. I'm ordering you to stop.

245
00:16:58,053 --> 00:17:00,589
If you keep attacking, I won't pay you.

246
00:17:02,686 --> 00:17:05,096
Aah. Alright, I'll pay you double to stop.

247
00:18:08,842 --> 00:18:11,714
He's going to blast this whole place right off the cliff side.

248
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,668
I can't step out to waterbend at him without getting blown up.

249
00:18:19,668 --> 00:18:22,155
And I can't get a good enough angle on
him from down here.

250
00:18:23,695 --> 00:18:25,707
I know how to get an angle on him.

251
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:44,295
Alright buddy, don't fail me now.

252
00:18:55,445 --> 00:18:57,530
Yeah, boomerang!

253
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:05,865
Aww, boomerang.

254
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:51,878
I can't believe I'm saying this, but... thanks Zuko.

255
00:19:51,998 --> 00:19:54,711
Hey, what about me? I did the boomerang thing.

256
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:58,411
Listen. I know I didn't explain myself very well yesterday.

257
00:19:58,414 --> 00:20:01,934
I've been through a lot in the past few years, and it's been hard.

258
00:20:02,428 --> 00:20:06,545
But I'm realizing that I had to go through all those things to learn the truth.

259
00:20:07,257 --> 00:20:10,953
I thought I had lost my honor, and that somehow my father could return it to me.

260
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,872
But I know now that no one can give you your honor.

261
00:20:15,142 --> 00:20:18,483
It's something you earn for yourself by choosing to do what's right.

262
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,502
All I want now is to play my part in
ending this war.

263
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:26,418
And I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world.

264
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:31,337
I'm sorry for what I did to you. It was an accident.

265
00:20:31,436 --> 00:20:33,442
Fire can be dangerous and wild.

266
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,061
So as a firebender, I need to be more careful and control my bending,

267
00:20:38,061 --> 00:20:40,564
so I don't hurt people unintentionally.

268
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:45,832
I think you are supposed to be my firebending teacher.

269
00:20:46,107 --> 00:20:53,684
When I first tried to learn firebending, I burned Katara, and after that I never wanted to firebend again.

270
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:59,211
But now I know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love.

271
00:21:00,782 --> 00:21:02,936
I'd like you to teach me.

272
00:21:05,314 --> 00:21:09,964
Thank you. I'm so happy you've accepted me into your group.

273
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:14,520
Not so fast. I still have to ask my friends
if it's okay with them.

274
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,781
Toph, you're the one that Zuko burned. What do you think?

275
00:21:20,303 --> 00:21:25,126
Go ahead and let him join. It'll give me plenty of time to get back at him for burning my feet.

276
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:27,136
Sokka?

277
00:21:29,543 --> 00:21:32,277
Hey, all I want is to defeat the Fire Lord.

278
00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:35,151
If you think this is the way to do it, then I'm all for it.

279
00:21:37,652 --> 00:21:38,452
Katara?

280
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:48,645
I'll go along with whatever you think is right.

281
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:52,008
I won't let you down, I promise.

282
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:06,365
So, here you go. Home sweet home.

283
00:22:06,503 --> 00:22:08,366
I guess, you know, for now.

284
00:22:08,716 --> 00:22:11,379
Unpack. Lunch, soon.

285
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:13,890
Uhh. Welcome aboard.

286
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:18,949
Yeah.

287
00:22:18,949 --> 00:22:22,336
Okay. This is really, really weird.

288
00:22:31,097 --> 00:22:35,971
If I have to, I will spend every day of the rest of my life hunting the Avatar.

289
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:38,075
I know it's my destiny to capture him.

290
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:42,891
You know, prince Zuko, destiny is a funny thing.

291
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:46,198
You never know how things are going to work out.

292
00:22:46,346 --> 00:22:51,245
But if you keep an open mind and an open heart

293
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:54,873
I promise you will find your own destiny someday.

294
00:23:03,136 --> 00:23:06,883
You might have everyone else here
buying your "transformation",

295
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:11,017
but you and I both know you've struggled with doing the right thing in the past.

296
00:23:11,778 --> 00:23:14,245
So let me tell you something right now.

297
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:17,608
You make one step backward, one slip up,

298
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:20,132
give me one reason to think you might hurt Aang...

299
00:23:20,143 --> 00:23:22,994
and you won't have to worry about your destiny anymore.

300
00:23:23,065 --> 00:23:28,493
Because I will make sure your destiny ends, right then and there. Permanently.
