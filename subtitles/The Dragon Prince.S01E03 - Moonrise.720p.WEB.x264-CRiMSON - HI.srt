[Ezran] <i>Previously on</i>
" The Dragon Prince"...

00:00:20,198 --> 00:00:24,719
Every one of these men and women
would gladly trade their life

6
00:00:24,806 --> 00:00:26,639
to save yours.

7
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:28,098
Would you, Viren?

[scoffs]

00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:35,536
I'm here for the king, and I'm also here
for his son, Prince Ezran.

10
00:00:35,777 --> 00:00:37,872
Wait! You need to see something.

11
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:39,944
It can't be.

12
00:00:40,031 --> 00:00:42,237
[Callum] The egg. It wasn't destroyed.

13
00:00:42,324 --> 00:00:45,700
[Viren] Moonshadow elves are dangerous,
elite fighters.

14
00:00:45,787 --> 00:00:48,578
Under a full moon,
they become nearly invisible.

15
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:50,745
And they can penetrate any defense.

16
00:00:50,832 --> 00:00:54,125
Nothing in the five kingdoms
can stop them.

17
00:00:54,212 --> 00:00:57,962
When it is done, I will send a shadowhawk
with a blood ribbon message

18
00:00:58,049 --> 00:00:59,504
to the Queen of the Dragons.

19
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:02,230
We strike when the moon is highest.

But I don't understand.
The switching spell will save his life.

00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:29,320
Why would he say no?

31
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:31,531
King Harrow is a principled man.

32
00:03:31,618 --> 00:03:33,214
You mean "stubborn."

33
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:34,799
Watch your tongue.

34
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:37,038
But, yes, he is hardheaded.

Usually about the right things,
but about this... [sighs]

36

I don't know.

You look so... happy in this portrait.

I was.

00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:54,360
We posed for this a few days
after King Harrow's coronation.

40
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:58,281
He insisted I stand next to him
for the painting...

41
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:02,910
because he knew I would
stand by him through anything.

42
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,121
And you have.

43
00:04:05,653 --> 00:04:07,582
So far, yes.

44
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:15,715
I have to stand by him through this, too.

45
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,052
I need to be the man
he once believed I was.

46
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:21,929
What does that mean, Dad?

47
00:04:22,016 --> 00:04:26,434
It means there's one more thing
I can do to convince him.

48
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:27,879
What are you doing?

49
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:30,855
If I told you, you would try to stop me.

50
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:35,860
So, shouldn't I just try to stop you then,
even without knowing?

51
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,322
Goodbye, Claudia.

52

This changes everything.

55
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:37,455
So, this is it?
The egg of the Dragon Prince?

56
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:40,453
I can't believe it. If the egg lives...

57
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,385
Maybe it could stop the war.

58
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:51,852
He's okay in there. I can feel it.

59
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,585
But how?
[stammers] Why wasn't it destroyed?

60
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:57,761
[Claudia] Because my father saved it.

I can protect you from the elf.

64
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,227
Your father didn't save it. He stole it.

65
00:06:06,314 --> 00:06:07,605
That's a lie!

66
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:09,982
Then, Claudia, why is it here?

67
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:16,155
My father took it to protect us, Callum,
so the elves and dragons couldn't use it.

68
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,990
What are you talking about?
How can we use it?

69
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:20,660
Don't play dumb!

70
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,452
You know it's a powerful weapon.

71
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:25,636
It's not a weapon. It's an egg!

72
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,042
Ezran, don't be afraid.

73
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:31,684
Walk towards me,
and if she moves even an inch...

74
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:35,479
[energy crackling]

75
00:06:37,722 --> 00:06:40,428
Just bring that thing here.

76
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:42,306
It's not a thing!

77
00:06:42,393 --> 00:06:46,115
It has a mother,
and it needs to go back to her.

78
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:49,270
You're right. It wants its mother.

79
00:06:49,357 --> 00:06:51,203
Ezran, be careful.

80
00:06:58,868 --> 00:07:00,078
Follow me.

00:07:02,997 --> 00:07:05,342
Don't worry, I won't hit Ez.

The right thing. I hope.

Keep running.

96
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:06,180
[Ezran] Wait, not that way.

97
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:08,447
- Why not?
- [thuds]

98

but I don't know if I can do it.

You never mentioned you were a mage.

Who, me? No, I'm...
I'm not really anything.

115
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,288
You just did magic.

116
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,055
Yeah, that's what a mage is.

117
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,099
You're a mage.

118

Oh. Really?

119
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,687
Wow! I'm a mage!

120
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:23,257
[yelling] I'm a mage!

122
00:09:26,848 --> 00:09:28,389
Sorry. Sorry.

[whispers] I'm a mage!

124
00:09:46,577 --> 00:09:48,616
So, what's in the basket?

125
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:50,507
A bigger moth?

126
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,678
It's something that will protect the king
when all your swords have failed.

127
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:57,890
Uh, you...
You know they can hear you, right?

128
00:09:58,047 --> 00:09:59,557
He knows, sir.

129
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:02,755
I am prepared to do anything
to protect the king.

130
00:10:02,842 --> 00:10:03,966
Anything.

131

Listen, I need you to give me the egg.

I have to get it to the roof, right away.

What? Why?

136
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,362
Just trust me.

137
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:26,405
Right, right. That makes sense.

138
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:27,633
Since we go way back.

139
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,290
Like that one time, ten minutes ago,

140
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:31,653
when you chased me through the castle
trying to stab me?

141
00:10:31,753 --> 00:10:33,371
[laughs] Good times.

142
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,295
You might not realize it,
but I'm trying to help you.

143
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:38,583
Any moment now, others will be arriving.

144
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,349
Others like me.

145
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,007
Assassins.

146
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,424
I need to show them the egg to stop them.

147
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:48,065
Just give it to me.

148
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,821
- [croaks]
- I'll take you to the roof.

149
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:12,074
I've given thought to what you said.

150
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:13,589
Oh, have you?

151
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:20,626
Then why have you returned
with that abomination?

152
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,087
Yes, I've brought the soulfang.

153
00:11:23,174 --> 00:11:25,811
I have a proposal. Let me explain.

154
00:11:26,427 --> 00:11:27,427
Go on.

155
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:30,010
[sighs]

156
00:11:30,097 --> 00:11:32,109
You are my king...

157
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:34,445
but you are also my friend.

158
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,848
Your friend?

159
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:37,212
Yes.

160
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:41,479
Right now, I do not
come to you as my king.

161
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:44,830
I think of you... as my brother.

162
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:47,153
I see the problem now.

163
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,654
It's that you believe you are special,

164
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:53,742
better than everyone else,
above the laws of this kingdom.

165
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:55,993
That's not what I was trying to say.
Please, listen.

166
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,205
Assassins are coming to murder me tonight,

167
00:11:58,292 --> 00:12:00,491
and you're wasting
what precious time I have left.

168
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:02,529
- No, Harrow, I...
- Stop.

169
00:12:02,616 --> 00:12:04,377
How about, "No, Your Highness."

170
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:08,966
In fact, let's try, "Yes, Your Highness"
for a change.

171
00:12:09,053 --> 00:12:11,968
Oh, are you sure you wouldn't prefer
"Your Royal Highness"?

172
00:12:12,055 --> 00:12:14,930
"Your Esteemed Inimitable Majesty,"
perhaps?

173
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:17,932
I have tolerated your arrogance
for too long,

174
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:19,642
maybe even encouraged it.

175
00:12:19,729 --> 00:12:24,940
But if today is my last day as king,
you will know your place.

176
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:27,692
And where exactly is that place?

177
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,000
Right here.

178
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:33,670
On... your... knees.

179
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,680
You are a servant
of the kingdom of Katolis.

180
00:12:44,714 --> 00:12:46,725
You are a servant.

181
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,759
[squawks]

182
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,017
You're here.

183
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:01,740
I know you are.

184
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,492
[Runaan] Rayla.

185
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:08,692
You defied me.

186
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:11,458
Runaan, you need to call off the mission.

187
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,279
You've lost your mind.

188
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:14,692
Please, listen to me.

189
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:16,073
I've found something.

190
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,423
The egg of the Dragon Prince.

191
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:19,745
That's impossible.

192
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,289
The egg wasn't destroyed, it was stolen.

193
00:13:22,376 --> 00:13:24,588
Their High Mage
was going to use it for dark magic,

194
00:13:24,675 --> 00:13:27,543
but the human princes found it,
and they're only trying to help...

195
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,256
No. Humans are liars.

196
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:32,049
This is a trick and a trap.

197
00:13:32,136 --> 00:13:33,424
You're a fool, Rayla.

198
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:35,148
She's not a fool.

199
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:38,026
What she's telling you is true.

200
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:41,057
You've made a terrible mistake.

201
00:13:41,144 --> 00:13:43,282
Ez, show him.

202
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:49,984
[stammers] It's beautiful.

203
00:13:50,071 --> 00:13:53,570
How can we take vengeance
for an act that never happened?

204
00:13:53,657 --> 00:13:54,987
You have to call it off.

205
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:57,448
Rayla, you know it doesn't work that way.

206
00:13:57,535 --> 00:13:59,159
We bound ourselves.

207
00:13:59,246 --> 00:14:01,077
There's only one way to release.

208
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:02,621
Runaan, please.

209
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,456
There has to be another way.

210
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,916
This is a miracle, a chance for peace.

211
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:10,378
The humans struck down
the King of the Dragons.

212
00:14:10,465 --> 00:14:12,630
Justice will not be denied.

213
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:14,396
Now, give me the egg.

214
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,760
Callum, Ezran, go.

215
00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:18,942
- But...
- Just keep it safe.

216
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:32,706
Don't do this.

217
00:14:33,781 --> 00:14:35,528
I will kill you.

218
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:36,861
Probably.

219
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:41,506
[swords clanging]

220
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:47,221
[sighs] Let's see,
a spell to break the chain.

221
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:49,003
[winces]

222
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:57,178
[gasps]

223
00:14:58,305 --> 00:15:01,262
Well, fun as it would be
to turn the chains into snakes,

224
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:03,487
I guess I'll just use the key.

225
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:07,523
[panting]

226
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:12,813
You need to stay here, hidden.

227
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:13,984
[croaks]

228
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:16,277
- Keep the egg safe.
- [croaks]

229
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:18,168
I'll go talk to the king.

230
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,700
Callum, why don't you just call him "Dad"?

231
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,590
Because he's the king.

232
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,080
And I'm his stepson.

233
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:28,330
I think he would want you to.

234
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:30,013
If you wanted to.

235
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:32,724
I don't know about that.

236
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:34,725
Be right back.

237
00:15:41,265 --> 00:15:44,264
Whoa, slow down there, step-prince.

238
00:15:44,351 --> 00:15:45,723
The king's pretty busy right now.

239
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,017
Trying not to, you know, die and stuff.

240
00:15:48,104 --> 00:15:49,783
You're not stopping me.

241
00:15:50,357 --> 00:15:52,744
You should not be here.

242
00:15:57,948 --> 00:16:00,043
- [grunting]
- [swords clanging]

243
00:16:07,082 --> 00:16:08,579
You're better than this.

244
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:09,790
No, not really.

245
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:11,540
You've had about 20 years more training.

246
00:16:11,627 --> 00:16:13,585
Not your fighting skills.

247
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,310
- I mean your character.
- [grunts]

248
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:34,189
You saw the egg.

249
00:16:34,276 --> 00:16:36,830
There's no need for vengeance tonight.

250
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:41,784
[panting]

251
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,619
You're just trying to stall me.

252
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:50,532
Interesting theory.

253
00:16:50,619 --> 00:16:52,137
Care to discuss?

254
00:16:52,253 --> 00:16:54,681
Your justice will come later.

255
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,309
[Rayla] No, wait!

256
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,506
[Callum] I know what you did.

257
00:17:00,593 --> 00:17:02,795
You stole the egg of the Dragon Prince.

258
00:17:02,882 --> 00:17:05,088
We found it, and we're keeping it safe.

259
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:06,219
"We"?

260
00:17:06,306 --> 00:17:09,488
The king will have you in shackles
when he finds out about this.

261
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:13,283
What makes you so sure
he doesn't already know?

262
00:17:13,691 --> 00:17:14,980
Grab him.

263
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,397
But he's the Prince.

264
00:17:16,484 --> 00:17:17,538
Do it!

265
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:20,655
[yelps]

266
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:23,906
Now, tell me.

267
00:17:23,993 --> 00:17:25,699
Where is the egg?

268
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:28,075
I'll call out. I'll scream.

269
00:17:28,162 --> 00:17:29,423
Go ahead.

270
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:33,711
[chanting]

271
00:17:47,224 --> 00:17:48,224
[wheezes]

[thuds]

273
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:36,143
This one's not so good at hiding.

274
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,399
[croaks]

275
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,744
I told him that.

276
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:41,942
Uh, where's your brother?

277
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:44,583
He went up to the tower to see our dad.

278
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:49,212
Oh, no. That's the last place
he should be right now.

279
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:53,787
You impudent little mongrel.

280
00:18:53,874 --> 00:18:57,291
You were spoiled and given everything...

281
00:18:57,378 --> 00:19:00,709
and that has left you weak and helpless.

282
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:07,049
Tonight, your world is changing,
and there is nothing you or anyone can...

283
00:19:07,136 --> 00:19:08,565
[wind howling]

284
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:19,743
They're here.

285

[exclaims]

286
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,211
Defend the doors!

[coughs]

290
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:58,989
King Harrow!

291
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,067
Dad!

292
00:20:13,495 --> 00:20:15,006
[Ezran] Callum!

293
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,136
Callum, where are you?

294
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,670
Callum!

295
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,516

[grunts]

298
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:52,197
Callum. Did you talk with Dad?

299
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,170
[swords clanging in distance]

300
00:20:58,165 --> 00:21:01,553
Say the word and I'll go back
into that tower with you.

301
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:08,560
No. It's up to us now.

302
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:10,923
We have to return this egg.

303
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:15,066
We have to keep it safe
and carry it to Xadia.

304
00:21:15,153 --> 00:21:17,068
And find its mother.

305
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:19,057
We could change things.

306
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,766
We could make a difference.

307
00:21:20,853 --> 00:21:22,267
Just the three of us.

308
00:21:22,354 --> 00:21:23,404
[croaks]

00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,412
[stammers] The four of us.

310
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,353
[Ezran] Callum, do you think
Dad will be okay?

311
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:54,800
He has the finest guards
in the kingdom defending him.

312
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:56,000
Yeah.

313
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,860
Yeah, of course.

314
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,317

[screeching]

317
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:03,091
Finish this.

318
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:04,411
My pleasure.

319
00:23:04,498 --> 00:23:09,431
No. We can find
more practical uses for this one.

320
00:23:09,671 --> 00:23:11,266
Tie him up.

321
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,961
[Callum] What's going on?

322
00:23:41,203 --> 00:23:43,047
Something's wrong.

323
00:23:43,134 --> 00:23:44,631
No, it's...

324
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:46,843
We should stop and rest soon.

325
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,637
It's a long journey to Xadia.
