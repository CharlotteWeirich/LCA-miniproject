1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Water,

2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,447
Earth,

3
00:00:04,448 --> 00:00:06,197
Fire,

4
00:00:06,198 --> 00:00:08,602
Air

5
00:00:08,603 --> 00:00:13,111
Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.

6
00:00:13,134 --> 00:00:17,264
Then, everything changed
when the fire nation attacked.

7
00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:22,160
Only the avatar, master of all
four elements, could stop them.

8
00:00:22,203 --> 00:00:24,982
But when the world
needed him most, he vanished.

9
00:00:25,017 --> 00:00:29,649
100 years passed, and my brother and i
discovered the new avatar,

10
00:00:29,684 --> 00:00:31,176
an airbender named Aang

11
00:00:31,211 --> 00:00:33,628
And although his
airbending skills are great

12
00:00:33,663 --> 00:00:36,537
He has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.

13
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:40,374
But i believe Aang
can save the world.

14
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:46,011
by om4gus.blogspot.com

15
00:01:06,565 --> 00:01:09,663
Zukko, don't worry. We can take azulla.

16
00:01:09,698 --> 00:01:12,666
I'm not worry about her. I am worry about Aang.

17
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:15,578
What if he doesn't have a guts to take up my father?

18
00:01:15,613 --> 00:01:17,949
What if he loses?

19
00:01:17,984 --> 00:01:21,045
Aang won't loses. He is gonna come back.

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,541
He has to.

21
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:44,876
What am I holding?

22
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:48,388
A cherry pip, princess...

23
00:01:48,423 --> 00:01:50,653
Correct. And what day it this?

24
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:53,011
It is the day of your coronation...

25
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:58,094
Yes it is. So please, tell me why in the most important day of my life,

26
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:00,499
you decide to leave a pip in my cherry?

27
00:02:00,534 --> 00:02:04,656
It was't a decision. I was just a small mistake.

28
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:09,139
Small? Do you realize what could happen if I hadn't sense a pip in time?

29
00:02:09,174 --> 00:02:12,329
I suppose, you could be cough?

30
00:02:12,364 --> 00:02:15,844
Yes. And do you understand the deserveability of your crime?

31
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,010
I understand princess. Please, forgive me.

32
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:24,741
Oh, very well. Because it is a special day, I will show mercy.

33
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,808
You are banished! Leave this palace immediately!

34
00:02:31,114 --> 00:02:34,717
What do you all looking at? I have two feet you need to be scrubbing

35
00:02:34,752 --> 00:02:36,895
And make sure you did it between the toes.

36
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:41,000
I don't want had my first day as a Fire Lord my bare foot feet first hiky.

37
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:49,563
It's weird to say. But the comet actually looks beautiful.

38
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:52,981
Too bad the Fire Lord would use it to destroyed the world.

39
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,301
We're too late! The fleet army would taking off!

40
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:23,474
And we would taking off too

41
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,229
Where is the closest of the airship?

42
00:03:25,694 --> 00:03:27,033
It's right.. urgh

43
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,146
Ugh!

44
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:08,383
You send first princess. Is everything alright?

45
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:10,835
Actually, everything is not alright.

46
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,868
Do you know how long you could get here?

47
00:04:12,903 --> 00:04:14,903
eeeew, few minutes I guess?

48
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:16,567
Five to be precise.

49
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:21,662
And which time who assasin could snuck in, down away with me and bind on his merry away

50
00:04:21,697 --> 00:04:23,081
My apologize princess

51
00:04:23,116 --> 00:04:27,982
Is this how you plan to treat your new Fire Lord? retardiness on disloyalty?

52
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,383
The daili would never betray you!

53
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:34,499
And I'm sure this is what just you told Long Feng before turned again him and joined me

54
00:04:34,534 --> 00:04:36,995
You are all banished!

55
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,457
But..,
Good Bye!

56
00:04:42,758 --> 00:04:47,549
Please attend the next through on your wayout

57
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:00,359
Hush!

58
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,086
That's how its done!

59
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:48,085
Good work Toph. It's time to take control of this ship. Take the wheel

60
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,040
That's a good idea. Let the blind girl steal the giant airship!

61
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:53,795
I was talking to sukki.

62
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,338
That a big allow more set

63
00:05:56,373 --> 00:05:58,510
What we gonna do to rescue the crew?

64
00:05:58,545 --> 00:06:01,525
Take as close as to the water. I've got an idea

65
00:06:05,422 --> 00:06:09,272
Attention crew. This is your captain speaking.

66
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:15,396
Everyone please report to the bin bay immediately! For hard days and smith creek!

67
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:18,669
We have a special birthday to celebrate

68
00:06:27,857 --> 00:06:32,385
Hey, I'm Kwen lee. I work up in communication.

69
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,435
Oh hey. I work down in the enginering.

70
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,687
It's far a long minutes before. Big auction you know?

71
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:43,524
Yup. so, Do you know whose birthday it is?

72
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:49,114
I can't believe captain remember my birthday. He really does care!

73
00:06:57,174 --> 00:06:59,486
Happy Birthday!

74
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:07,124
Fire Lord Ozai, Here we come!

75
00:07:20,932 --> 00:07:25,508
Azulla, we heard what happen. Why had you bannished all of your servant.

76
00:07:25,543 --> 00:07:29,438
Or your daili agent. And the imperial's fire benders

77
00:07:29,473 --> 00:07:34,290
None of them could be trusted. Sooner or later they all would be betrayed me.

78
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:36,926
Just like Mai and Ty Lee did.

79
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:40,449
Azulla. We're concern for you and your well being.

80
00:07:40,484 --> 00:07:44,656
My father ask me to come here and talk to me, didn't he?

81
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:48,491
He just can handled responsibility of being Fire Lord

82
00:07:48,526 --> 00:07:51,863
And I will be the greatest leader in the fire nation history

83
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:55,928
I'm sure you will. But considering everything does happen today,

84
00:07:55,963 --> 00:07:59,223
perhaps we must be postpone your coronation

85
00:07:59,294 --> 00:08:03,001
What? Which of you who just say that?

86
00:08:03,036 --> 00:08:09,561
What ashame, there's only one way to resolve this. You two must duel each other.

87
00:08:09,596 --> 00:08:12,195
I order you to fight in Agni Kai!

88
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,340
But, we are not fire benders...

89
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:20,375
Alright, fine. Lou, you banish. Lee, you can stay

90
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,889
But, I'm Lee. So who is banished?

91
00:08:37,304 --> 00:08:41,695
Ba sing sei. The order of the white lord is here.

92
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,100
Here does set you free.

93
00:08:44,135 --> 00:08:50,334
Only ones every hundred year kind of fire bender experienced this kind of power.

94
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:26,761
Alright hair. It's time to face your doom.

95
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:34,210
What ashame. You always had such a beautiful hair

96
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:36,707
What do you do doing here?

97
00:10:36,742 --> 00:10:39,988
I didn't wanna miss my own daughter's coronation

98
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:43,826
Don't pretend to act proud. I know what you really think of me

99
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:45,107
'She is some kind of monsters'

100
00:10:45,142 --> 00:10:50,478
I think you confuse. All your life you wear fear to control people.

101
00:10:50,513 --> 00:10:53,392
Like your friends, Mai and Ty Lee.

102
00:10:53,427 --> 00:10:56,305
Who betrays that I have. Trusting was fools.

103
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,694
Fears is the only reliable way. Even you fear me

104
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:05,500
No, I love you Azulla. I do

105
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,493
Urgh.

106
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,304
We are not gonna catch up to him in time

107
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:37,829
No

108
00:12:10,073 --> 00:12:12,797
Momo, time for you to go

109
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,179
What just happen?

110
00:13:14,214 --> 00:13:17,137
It's Aang. He is back!

111
00:13:29,587 --> 00:13:34,022
After generations Fire Lord failed to find you,

112
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:42,249
now the universe delivers you to me as an act of rouvedens

113
00:13:42,284 --> 00:13:44,790
Please listem to me. We don't have to fight.

114
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:48,305
You have the power to end it here and stop what you are doing

115
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:56,300
You alright. I do have the power. I have all the power in the world!

116
00:14:16,843 --> 00:14:19,393
Go away. Aviatic slice.

117
00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:21,197
Should we helping him?

118
00:14:21,232 --> 00:14:23,394
The Fire Lord - Aang's fight.

119
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,105
We need to be stayed focus on stoping that fleet from burning down the earth kingdom.

120
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,609
And how did we do that captain boomerang?

121
00:14:29,644 --> 00:14:32,055
I can't see the outside of this heaving of metals.

122
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,833
Airship slice!

123
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:14,083
Woaw! That's a lot of fire, isn't?

124
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:39,239
It's gonna a lot of fire. we gonna take the top of this thing fast

125
00:15:41,246 --> 00:15:43,426
Then what?

126
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:47,417
Watch yours each other back. And when you get that far, I'll let you know.

127
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:20,864
Sukkiiii!

128
00:16:22,393 --> 00:16:26,417
I'm OK. Just finish the mission.

129
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,681
No

130
00:16:27,716 --> 00:16:29,345
Sokka. I think we got it.

131
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:48,357
By degree of phoenix King Ozai. I now crown you Fire Lord..

132
00:16:48,392 --> 00:16:51,323
What are you waiting for? Do it!

133
00:16:56,085 --> 00:16:59,596
Sorry. But you will not become Fire Lord today.

134
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:02,694
I'm

135
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:05,699
Hahaha. You're hillarious

136
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,967
And you are going down

137
00:17:08,002 --> 00:17:13,834
Wait. You want to be Fire Lord. Fine. Let settle this.

138
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:19,701
Just you and me, brother. The showdown that always mean to be. Agni Kai!

139
00:17:19,736 --> 00:17:22,614
You are on your own.

140
00:17:24,285 --> 00:17:26,788
What are you doing? she is playing you.

141
00:17:26,823 --> 00:17:29,539
She know she can't take us both. So she trying to separate us

142
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:32,734
I know. But I can take it this time.

143
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:36,295
But even you with meditate uncle can't seatle this with Azulla.

144
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,943
There's something over bother her. I can explain about she is sleeping.

145
00:17:39,978 --> 00:17:43,089
And this way no one of us will get hurt

146
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,400
I'm sorry it has to end this way, brother.

147
00:17:58,435 --> 00:17:59,742
No, you're not.

148
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,604
Urgh!

149
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:34,623
No Lighting today? What's matter? Affraid I will be directed?

150
00:21:34,658 --> 00:21:37,530
Oh, I'll show you lightning!

151
00:21:59,397 --> 00:22:02,226
No!

152
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:17,057
Zukko!

153
00:22:34,808 --> 00:22:38,921
Hahaha, You're weak. Just like the rest of your people!

154
00:22:38,956 --> 00:22:43,034
They didn't deserve to live in my world! In my world

155
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:48,022
Prepare you join them! Prepare to Die!

156
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:18,554
