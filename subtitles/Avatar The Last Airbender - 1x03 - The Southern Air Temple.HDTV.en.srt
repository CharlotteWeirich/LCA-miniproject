1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,000
Water

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Earth

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Fire

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Air

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Long ago, the four nations...

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
...lived together in harmony.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Then, everthing changed when the Fire Nation attacked.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But when the world needed him most...

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
...he vanished!

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
A hundred years passed, and my brother and I...

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
...discovered the new Avatar,...

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
...an airbender named Aang.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And although his airbending skills are great...

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
...he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But I believe Aang can save the world.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Book One: Water
Chapter Three: The Southern Air Temple

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Wait 'til you see it, Katara.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Air Temple is one of the most beautiful places in the world.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Aang, I know you're excited, but...

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
...it's been a hundred years since you've been home.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's why I'm so excited!

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's just that a lot can change in all that time.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I know, but I need to see it for myself.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Wake up, Sokka!

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Air Temple here we come!

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Sleep now... temple later...

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Sokka! Wake up! 
There's a prickle snake in your sleeping bag!

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Aaahhh! Get it off! Get it off! Aaahhh! 

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Great! You're awake. Let's go.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Uncle, I want the repairs made as quickly as possible.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't want to stay too long and risk losing his trail.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You mean the Avatar?

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't mention his name on these docks!

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Once word gets out that he's alive every 
firebender will be out looking for him...

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
...and I don't want anyone getting in the way.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Getting in the way of what...

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Prínce Zuko?

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Capitain Zhao.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's Commander now...

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
...And General Iroh...

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
...great hero of our nation.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Retired General.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The Fire Lord's brother and son are welcome guests any time.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What brings you to my harbor?

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Our ship is being repaired. 

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's quite a bit of damage.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes... you wouldn't believe what happened.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Uncle! Tell Commander Zhao what happened.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes, I will do that.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It was incredible...

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What... did we crash or something?

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Uh, yes! Right into an Earth Kingdom ship.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Really? You must regale me with all the thrilling details.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Join me for a drink?

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Sorry, but we have to go.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Prince Zuko, show Commander Zhao your respect.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We would be honored to join you.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Do you have any ginseng tea?

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
...It's my favorite.

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Hey, stomach, be quiet, all right?

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm trying to find us some food. 

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Hey! Who ate all my blubbered seal jerky?

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Oh, that was food?

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I used it to start the campfire last night.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Sorry.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You WHAT???

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Awww, no wonder the flames smelled so good.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The Batola mountain range! We're almost there!

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Aang? Before we get to the temple...

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I want to talk to you about the airbenders.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What about'em?

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Well, I just want you to be prepared for what you might see.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The Fire Nation is ruthless.

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
They killed my mother...

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
...and they could have done the same to your people.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Just because no one has seen an airbender...

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
...doesn't mean the Fire Nation killed them all.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
They probably escaped.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I know it's hard to accept.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You don't understand, Katara.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison...

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
...and I doubt the Fire Nation has any flying bison.

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Right, Appa?

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
There it is... the Southern Air Temple.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Aang, it's amazing!

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We're home, buddy. We're home.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And by year's end, the Earth Kingdom capital 
will be under our rule. 

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The Fire Lord will finally claim victory in this war.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
If my father thinks the rest of the world
will follow him willingly...

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
...then he is a fool. 

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Two years at sea have done little
to temper your tongue.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So...

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
...how is your search for the Avatar going?

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
My fault entirely.

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We haven't found him yet.

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Did you really expect to?

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The Avatar died a hundred years ago...

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
...along with the rest of the airbenders. 

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Unless you found some evidence...

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
...that the Avatar is alive.

102
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,300
No. Nothing.

103
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,000
Prínce Zuko...

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
...the Avatar is the only one who can stop...

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
the Fire Nation from winning this war.

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
If you have an ounce of loyalty left...

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
...you'll tell me what you've found.

108
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,000
I haven't found anything.

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's like you said.

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The Avatar probably died a long time ago.

111
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,000
Come on, Uncle, we're going.

112
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,300
Commander Zhao...

113
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,000
...we interrogated the crew as you instructed.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
They confirmed Prince Zuko had the Avatar in custody...

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
...but let him escape.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Now, remind me...

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
...how exactly was your ship damaged? 

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So where do I get something to eat? 

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You're lucky enough to be one of the first 
outsiders to ever visit an airbender temple...

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
...and all you can think about is food?

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm just a simple guy with simple needs.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So that's where my friends and I would play airball!

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And... over there would be where the bison would sleep...

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
...and...

125
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,000
What's wrong?

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This place used to be full of 
monks and lemurs and bison.

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Now there's just a bunch of weeds. 

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I can't believe how much things have changed.

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So, uh, this airball game?

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
How do you play? 

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Hahaha! Aang 7, Sokka 0!

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Making him feel better is putting me in a world of hurt.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Katara, check this out.

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,300
Fire Nation.

135
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,000
We should tell him.

136
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,000
Aang, there's something you need to see.

137
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,600
Okay.

138
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:31,501
What is it?

139
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,000
Uh... just a new waterbending move I learned.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Nice one. But enough practicing.

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We have a whole temple to see! 

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You know, you can't protect him forever.

143
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,000
Katara, firebenders were here.

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,900
You can't pretend they weren't.

145
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I can for Aang's sake. 

146
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If he finds out that the Fire Nation invaded his home...

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,700
...he'll be devastated.

148
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,000
Hey guys! I want you to meet somebody.

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Who's that?

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Monk Gyatso...

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
...the greatest airbender in the world.

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He taught me everything I know. 

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,700
But the true secret... is in the gooey center!

154
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,200
Hmmm...
My ancient cake making technique...

155
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:24,001
...isn't the only thing on your mind, is it, Aang?

156
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,000
This whole Avatar thing...

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
...maybe the monks made a mistake.

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The only mistake they made was telling you...

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
...before you turned sixteen.

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But we can't concern ourselves with what was.

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
We must act on what is.

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But Gyatso...

163
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,500
...how do I know if I'm ready for this?

164
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,000
Your questions will be answered...

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
...when you are old enough to enter the Air Temple sanctuary.

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,500
Inside you will meet someone...

167
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,000
...who will guide you on your journey.

168
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Who is it?

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,800
When you are ready he will reveal himself to you.

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Now...

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
...are you going to help me with these cakes, or not?

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
All right.

173
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:16,001
One... two... three!

174
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Your aim has improved greatly my young pupil.

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You must miss him.

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah.

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,500
Where are you going?

178
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
The Air Temple Sanctuary.

179
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,500
There's someone I'm ready to meet. 

180
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,000
But Aang...

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
...no one could have survived
in there for a hundred years.

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's not impossible...

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I survived in the iceberg for that long.

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Good point.

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Katara, whoever's in there might 
help me figure out this Avatar thing!

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And whoever's in there might have 
a medley of delicious, cured meats!

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't suppose you have a key?

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The key, Sokka...

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,500
...is airbending.

190
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hello?

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Anyone home?

192
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,600
So, a twelve-year-old boy bested 
you and your firebenders?

193
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,000
You're more pathetic than I thought.

194
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,700
I underestimated him once, 
but it will not happen again.

195
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,000
No, it will not...

196
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
...because you won't have a second chance.

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Commander Zhao, I've been hunting 
the Avatar for two years and I...

198
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And you failed!

199
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Capturing the Avatar is too important...

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
...to leave in a teenager's hands.

201
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He's mine now.

202
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,000
Keep them here.

203
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
More tea please?

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Statues?

205
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's it?

206
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,500
Where's the meat?

207
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,000
Who are all these people?

208
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm not sure...

209
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
...but it feels like I know them somehow.

210
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Look! That one's an airbender!

211
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And this one's a waterbender.

212
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
They're lined up in a pattern.

213
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Air, water...

214
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
...earth and fire.

215
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,500
That's the avatar cycle.

216
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
Of course!

217
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,000
They're Avatars.

218
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
All these people are your past lives, Aang.

219
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Wow! There's so many!

220
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,000
Past lives?

221
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,100
Katara, you really believe in that stuff?

222
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,000
It's true.

223
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,800
When the Avatar dies...

224
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,000
...he's reincarnated into the next nation in the cycle.

225
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Aang, snap out of it!

226
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,500
Who is that?

227
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,000
That's Avatar Roku, the Avatar before me.

228
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,600
You were a firebender?

229
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,800
No wonder I didn't trust you when we first met.

230
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,000
There's no writing.

231
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
How do you know his name?

232
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm not sure...

233
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,600
...I just know it somehow.

234
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,500
You just couldn't get any weirder!

235
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Firebender.

236
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Nobody make a sound.

237
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You're making a sound!
Shhhh!

238
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
That firebender won't know what hit 'em.

239
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Lemur!

240
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Dinner......

241
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Don't listen to him! 
You're going to be my new pet.

242
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Not if I get him first!

243
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,000
Wait! Come back!

244
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I wanna eat you!

245
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,000
Hey! No Fair!

246
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
My search party is ready. 

247
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Once I'm out to sea, my guards 
will escort you back to your ship...

248
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
...and you'll be free to go.

249
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Why?

250
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Are you worried I'm going to try and stop you?

251
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You? Stop me?

252
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Impossible.

253
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Don't underestimate me, Zhao.

254
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I will capture the Avatar before you. 

255
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Prince Zuko...

256
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,400
That's enough!

257
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,000
You can't compete with me.

258
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I have hundreds of warships under my command...

259
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
...and you...

260
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
you're just a banished prince.

261
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
No home. No allies.

262
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,600
Your own father doesn't even want you.

263
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,000
You're wrong.

264
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Once I deliver the Avatar to my father...

265
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
...he will welcome me home with honor...

266
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
...and restore my rightful place on the throne.

267
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
If your father really wanted you home...

268
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
...he'd have let you return by now...

269
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Avatar or no Avatar.

270
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But in his eyes you are a failure...

271
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
...and a disgrace to the Fire Nation.

272
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That's not true.

273
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You have the scar to prove it.

274
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Maybe you'd like one to match!

275
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Is that a challenge?

276
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,500
An "agni kai".

277
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,000
At sunset.

278
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,000
Very well.

279
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's a shame your father won't be here...

280
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
...to watch me humiliate you.

281
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I guess your uncle will do.

282
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Prince Zuko...

283
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
...have you forgotten what happened last time...

284
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,100
...you dueled a master?

285
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,000
I will never forget. 

286
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Hey! Come back! 

287
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,000
Come on out, little lemur.

288
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That hungry guy won't bother you anymore.

289
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Firebenders?

290
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
They were here?

291
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Gyatso!

292
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,000
Hey Aang, you find my dinner yet? 

293
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,000
Aang, I wasn't really going to eat the lemur, okay?

294
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,500
Oh, man...

295
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,000
Come on, Aang, everything will be all right.

296
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Let's get out of here.

297
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Send word to the Fire Lord...

298
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
...immediately.

299
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The Avatar has returned!

300
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,000
Aang! Come on...

301
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
...snap out of it!

302
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What happened?

303
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
He found out firebenders killed Gyatso.

304
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh no, it's his avatar spirit!

305
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He must have triggered it!

306
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm gonna try and calm him down.

307
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Well, do it...

308
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
...before he blows us off the mountain!

309
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Remember your firebending basics, Prince Zuko.

310
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
They are your greatest weapons.

311
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I refuse to let him win. 

312
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,000
This will be over quickly. 

313
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Basics, Zuko!

314
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Break his root!

315
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Do it!

316
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,000
That's it?

317
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Your father raised a coward.

318
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,400
Next time you get in my way, I promise...

319
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,000
I won't hold back.

320
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
No, Prince Zuko...

321
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Do not taint your victory. 

322
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So this is how the great Commander Zhao...

323
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,500
...acts in defeat?

324
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Disgraceful. 

325
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,000
Even in exile...

326
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
...my nephew is more honorable than you.

327
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,500
Thanks again for the tea.

328
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,000
It was delicious.

329
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Did you really mean that, Uncle?

330
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,300
Of course.

331
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,200
I told you ginseng tea is my favorite.

332
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,500
Aang, I know you're upset... 

333
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,700
...and I know how hard it is to lose the people you love.

334
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,000
I went through the same thing when I lost my mom.

335
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Monk Gyatso and the other airbenders...

336
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
...may be gone...

337
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
...but you still have a family.

338
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Sokka and I...

339
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
...we're your family now.

340
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Katara and I aren't going to let anything happen to you.

341
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Promise.

342
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm sorry.

343
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's okay.

344
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It wasn't your fault.

345
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But you were right.

346
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And if firebenders found this temple...

347
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
...that means they found the other ones, too.

348
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I really am the last airbender. 

349
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Everything's packed.

350
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,500
You ready to go?

351
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,000
How is Roku supposed to help me if I can't talk to him?

352
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Maybe you'll find a way.

353
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Looks like you made a new friend, Sokka.

354
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Can't talk. Must eat.

355
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
Hey little guy.

356
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You, me, and Appa. 

357
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
We're all that's left of this place.

358
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
We have to stick together.

359
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Katara, Sokka...

360
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
...say hello to the newest member of our family.

361
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
What are you going to name him?

362
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Momo.

363
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:31,001
