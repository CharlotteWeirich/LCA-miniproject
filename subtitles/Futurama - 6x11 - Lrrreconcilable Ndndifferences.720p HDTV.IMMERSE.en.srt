1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:04,203
¶ Two... two, three... ¶

2
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,385
You're
taking a vacation from normalcy.

3
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,487
A weird, motel

4
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:23,389
where the bed is stained
with mystery,

5
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,058
and there's also some mystery
floating in the pool.

6
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,861
Your key card may not open
the exercise room

7
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,830
because someone smeared mystery
on the lock.

8
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:33,432
But it will open...
The scary door.

9
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,403
Submitted for your emmy
consideration:

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,305
A popular senator
with unpopular ideas.

11
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,641
There is no such thing
as space aliens!

12
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,176
Oh?

13
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,944
How can you be so sure

14
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,247
them aliens ain't
already among us?

15
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,349
I'll tell you how.

16
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,718
Because you are one!

17
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,325
Hey, I was watching that!

18
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,661
The saints just needed
a field goal to tie!

19
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,797
Lrrr, you lazy ruler

20
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,799
of the planet Omicron Persei 8!

21
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,867
You said you would
conquer a planet today,

22
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,403
but you have not even
shed your skin yet!

23
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,907
Yes, NDND, I heard you
the first hundred times.

24
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,509
I'll conquer something
tomorrow after I fuel up

25
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,912
on one of your disgusting
egg-white omelets!

26
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,648
You want yolks? Fine.

27
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:26,085
Enjoy your stroke.

28
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:34,626
Ha-ha-ha! I am conquering earth.

29
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,296
Not so fast, invader x!

30
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:40,299
Here comes delivery-boy man!

31
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:45,671
Laser eye power!

32
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:48,841
Hand magnet power!

33
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:54,179
Yay, I'm unbuckled!

34
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,582
Stop it, you hero!

35
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:57,950
Reverse time power!

36
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,321
It's earlier now.

37
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,389
Mmm...

38
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,825
Mmm...

39
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,994
So what do you think
of my comic?

40
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,630
After I leave here,

41
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,398
I'm getting a memory enema.

42
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,567
If I might offer some
constructive criticism...

43
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,402
There was never any real peril.

44
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,539
I mean, the delivery guy has,
like, 30 super powers.

45
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:21,874
Well, that's because
he was bitten

46
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,675
by a radioactive superman!

47
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,844
This is wonderful!

48
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,379
It is, isn't it?

49
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,314
Wait, those are the ads.

50
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,550
These X-ray specs will

51
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,485
really take the guesswork out
of surgery.

52
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,421
No more chopping
blindly in the goop.

53
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,890
Don't waste your
allowance, Zoidberg.

54
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,192
This stuff is
butt-grade crap.

55
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,295
Amuse your friends
with real vomit.

56
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,496
Throw your voice.

57
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,731
Sea monkeys.

58
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,633
Throw your sea monkeys.

59
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,568
My disintegrator ray
really works.

60
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:50,969
But that's you.

61
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,804
That's how I know it's bunkum.

62
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,240
The Farnsworth novelty
disintegrator ray is

63
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,843
nothing more than a
common teleporter ray.

64
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,883
Pfft! Worthless toy!

65
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,919
I'm sick of being critiqued
by nitpicking nerds.

66
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,321
I'm taking this
to a comic book convention!

67
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,730
Shmeesh, it's crowded.

68
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,700
Good thing everyone is
freshly bathed and groomed.

69
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,535
Ooh!

70
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,271
What are you doing?!

71
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,472
That's the rare Zapp Brannigan

72
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,308
with recording session blooper!

73
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,443
Don't
tell me how to do the line.

74
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,011
It sickens me.

75
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,381
But the sign said there was
a mint in the box.

76
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,122
Thank you. Okay, thanks, thanks.
Settle, settle down!

77
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,958
So anyway, we're really excited

78
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,293
to show you guys the pilot
for our new series.

79
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:52,364
It's set in the year 4000,
and we call it Futurella!

80
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,640
¶ Two... two... ¶

81
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,909
Wow.

82
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,178
Fox has really streamlined
the process.

83
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,579
Matt will now take questions.

84
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:08,880
But please,
only about Futurella,

85
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,549
not the Simpsons.

86
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,785
Yes? The robot standing on
the small child over there?

87
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,821
Ooh! Ooh!
Yeah, uh, when are you going

88
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,789
to make a second simpsons movie?

89
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,725
Oh!

90
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,464
Mr. Aragonés, I'm a big
fan of your cartoons

91
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:26,732
and your moustache.

92
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,433
You want it? Take it!

93
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,168
It's brought me nothing
but misery.

94
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:31,837
Wow, thanks.

95
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,305
Ay-yi-yi!

96
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,940
If you could just quiet down,

97
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,942
I wanted to get your opinion
of my comic book.

98
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,412
Señor, anyone who still writes
comics is a hero to me.

99
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,615
Mmm, it stinks.

100
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,787
But, um, I do like the tiny
doodles in the margins.

101
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,456
That's just some relish
from a hot dog I found.

102
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,725
Man (Over P.A.
Attention, lady and gentlemen,

103
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,461
the costume contest
is about to begin.

104
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,629
The costume contest.

105
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,132
The costume contest...!

106
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,509
What the hell are you
supposed to be?

107
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:13,312
Every nerd's fantasy, baby.

108
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,148
Next up, contestant number 36!

109
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,624
Contestant 36, everyone!

110
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,693
Next up, contestant 37.

111
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,003
I am Lrrr,
ruler of the planet...

112
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,205
Hold on a second,
let me just get this.

113
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,608
I am Lrrr,

114
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,611
ruler of the planet Omicron
Persei 8.

115
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,513
You are hereby conquered!

116
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,215
Please line up in order

117
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,284
of how much beryllium it takes
to kill you!

118
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,125
Damn, that's a good costume.

119
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,328
Next up, contestant 38!

120
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,697
I don't understand.

121
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,599
Why are the humans still
eating their soft pretzels

122
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,301
instead of surrendering?

123
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,203
They're probably just waiting
for Joss Whedon.

124
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,604
Joss Whedon's here?!

125
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,140
Wait a minute.
You look familiar.

126
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,842
Yeah, you almost ate me once.

127
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,144
I was in your mouth
for five minutes.

128
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,278
Leela?

129
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,446
And the winner is...

130
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,614
Nerdgasma!

131
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,418
Whoo!
I got fruit boobs!

132
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,421
What's the use?

133
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,330
Now what?

134
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,265
I send you out to
conquer a planet,

135
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,934
and all you bring back
is J.J. Abrams' face?

136
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,803
I thought you'd like it.

137
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,405
You haven't even tried it on!

138
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:47,906
I might dress up in a face

139
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,708
if you ever took me
anywhere nice!

140
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,343
Oh, boy, here we go.

141
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,579
I built this castle
with my own two slaves!

142
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,715
What are you gonna do,
kick me out?

143
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:06,758
I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet
Omicron Persei 8!

144
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,527
May I crash on your couch?

145
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:15,233
So he just showed up
unannounced,

146
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,801
raided the liquor cabinet,

147
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:20,171
sprayed urine on the ceiling,
and passed out?

148
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,606
And the walls.

149
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,008
Yeah, leave me alone!

150
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:27,679
My wife hates me and planetary
conquest has become a chore.

151
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:29,047
There, there.

152
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,983
You're just having
a midlife crisis.

153
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,918
Midlife crisis, eh?

154
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:37,856
Lrrr demands the comfort of
pop-psychological platitudes!

155
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:40,125
Look, Hoss,
your wife threw you out.

156
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:41,893
That's your license
to be a jerk.

157
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,194
Do whatever the hell you want,

158
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:46,197
then walk away
and light a cigar.

159
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,899
Don't listen to him, Lrrr.

160
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,300
Bender may seem happy...

161
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,271
...But long-term,

162
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,341
you need to reinvest in
your relationship with NDND.

163
00:07:56,408 --> 00:08:00,111
Yes, it's clear what I must do.

164
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,928
I like it.

165
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,099
I'm thinking we need

166
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:25,170
to downplay those
hideous growths on your head.

167
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:26,938
Horns are a sign of virility.

168
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,206
Also, they house my testes.

169
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:32,143
I'm thinking horn extensions.

170
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,845
¶ ¶

171
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,315
You need some arm candy.

172
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,917
It's the perfect accessory

173
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:41,085
for out-of-shape middle-aged
creeps like you.

174
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,687
Yeah, I said it!

175
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,556
What's your type, Borgnine?

176
00:08:44,623 --> 00:08:46,824
Big and angry.

177
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,799
Look, Brah,
you're just not gonna find

178
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,235
a lot of hot, gigantic
Omicronian babes

179
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,670
in this solar system.

180
00:08:58,737 --> 00:08:59,804
There's one!

181
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:05,076
Hey, cool cape.

182
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,544
Where'd you get that?

183
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:07,946
What, this old thing?

184
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:09,781
Ah, I murdered my father.

185
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:13,251
My name's Lrrr, ruler
of the planet Omicron Persei 8.

186
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,886
I am called grrl.

187
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,689
Of the planet Omicron Persei 8?

188
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:19,557
That is a pretty name!

189
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,696
What's on the tv tonight?

190
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:27,732
Oh, wait, I don't care
'cause I got a date!

191
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,300
I know it's not what
you want to hear,

192
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:30,835
but I think this is a mistake.

193
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,370
Leela's right.

194
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,038
That's not what
you want to hear.

195
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,574
What you want to hear is
that I fixed my comic book!

196
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,076
Now the hero is more relatable

197
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:39,711
because he has no ridiculous
powers.

198
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:41,980
Let's watch, shall we?

199
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:44,182
One more step

200
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,850
and little miss constructive
criticism here gets it!

201
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,685
Oh, yeah?

202
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,288
I may be just a simple delivery
boy with no super powers,

203
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,323
so there's nothing I can do.

204
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,193
Okay. (Zapping)

205
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:00,098
So? Give me
your honest praise.

206
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:02,600
Fry, I've now seen
two comic books,

207
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,202
so listen to me.

208
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,639
Why should I care about the hero
when all he does is cry?

209
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:15,246
Mmm, that dinner
was a worthy foe.

210
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:19,284
Yes, we shall not see
its like again.

211
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:22,186
So, um...

212
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:24,756
Uh, uh...

213
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:28,259
Um, I'm sorry.

214
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,194
I-I haven't done this
for a while.

215
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:33,364
I just part-way out
of a bad relationship.

216
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,199
Maybe I should take this off.

217
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,340
You're a human?!

218
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,875
Only physically!

219
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:45,476
I'm a cross-species dresser.

220
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,513
Wait. You're
an actual Omicronian?

221
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,181
Oh, God, oh, God,
what have I done?

222
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,250
This is so hot!

223
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,785
Conquer me, Lrrr!

224
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:56,854
Sharpen your horns on
my scaly thorax!

225
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,164
I want to go home,

226
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:08,766
but NDND would never
take me back now.

227
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,769
NDND just wants
what every she-beast wants:

228
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,905
To feel like you're listening
to her nagging.

229
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:16,474
Is there anything she's
been riding your ass about?

230
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,310
Mmm... conquering things,
I guess.

231
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:22,280
I could conquer earth,
kill all humans.

232
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,981
That's a thought.

233
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:26,384
No. We don't need
a war of the worlds.

234
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,786
That's it. We need a
war of the worlds.

235
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,855
I'll call Orson Welles.

236
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,858
Dork calling Orson.
Dork calling Orson.

237
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,229
You're asking me,

238
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,965
the renowned spokesman
for Paul Masson wine,

239
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,702
to recreate my brilliant
1938 radio broadcast

240
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,237
merely to deceive and impress

241
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,072
the wife of this
skinny reptile?

242
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,941
Sorry. Never mind.

243
00:11:50,008 --> 00:11:51,175
I'll do it for free.

244
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,214
Ladies and gentlemen,
we interrupt our program

245
00:11:56,281 --> 00:11:57,982
of the Jonas brothers
and their orchestra

246
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,784
to bring you a special bulletin.

247
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:05,323
We interrupt our program
of the Jonas brothers

248
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,826
and their orchestra
to bring you a special bulletin.

249
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,262
I'm speaking to you
from the hickory farms

250
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,864
in grover's mall, new Jersey,

251
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:14,732
through a mouthful
of summer sausage.

252
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,034
Mmm. Where I hardly know
where to begin.

253
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:18,269
Mmm!

254
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,037
A huge spacecraft,

255
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:22,173
piloted by a devastatingly
handsome...

256
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,977
Now, how in God's name do I
know what the fellow looks like

257
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:28,179
if he's inside a ship
miles in the air?

258
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,814
It's just foolish on its face.

259
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,249
If you want the cheese log,

260
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:32,617
you'll read what I wrote.

261
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:34,886
Very well. I shall comply.

262
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,089
I'm getting reports that cities

263
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:41,259
across the globe are being
destroyed by this noble invader,

264
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:43,294
whose good looks
are apparently discernible

265
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,564
across vast distances
and through solid metal.

266
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,266
But wait,
the leader of the attack

267
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,001
is swaggering out of his ship

268
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:53,137
and up to a convenient
nearby microphone.

269
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,939
Now, why couldn't I have just

270
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,507
described his appearance
at this point?

271
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,910
This is the type of thing
I'm talking about.

272
00:12:58,977 --> 00:13:03,347
People of earth, I am Lrrr,
conqueror of your planet.

273
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,749
Cue screams.

274
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,686
You will now remove your skulls

275
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,289
and play dodgeball with them
for my amusement.

276
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:15,159
Ooh... I could swear his horns
have gotten longer.

277
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,232
Sir, I've intercepted
an earth broadcast.

278
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,768
Put it up on the zenith.

279
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:27,438
Earth is conquered,

280
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:30,274
the destruction
of civilization complete.

281
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:33,811
Now stay tuned
for little orphan Annie.

282
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,613
To hell with
little orphan Annie!

283
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,715
We've got to do something.

284
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:38,950
What's that, honey?

285
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:40,284
How many dead?

286
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,820
Uh, I don't know.
Uh, 80 million?

287
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,289
Okay. I love you, too.

288
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,791
That was NDND.

289
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,025
She's taking me back!

290
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,829
I'm sorry I've been
so difficult.

291
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,743
So, you thought you could
conquer us so easily, eh?

292
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:06,944
Nice job.

293
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,913
We surrender.

294
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,915
Earth is yours.

295
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,318
Damn, I'm good.

296
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,587
Now, may I please have
that cheese log?

297
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,426
Oh, glorious conqueror,

298
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,295
permit me to offer up
a sacrifice.

299
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,163
How about this?

300
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,466
Hey!

301
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,568
Yeah, he'll do.

302
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,570
Come on, Lrrr.
Show's over.

303
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,004
Fine. Okay.

304
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,740
About this conquering thing...

305
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,508
Funny story...

306
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,250
Hello...

307
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,786
Lrrr.

308
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:50,322
Lrrr, put a stop
to this right now.

309
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,190
Okay. Okay. Quit nagging.

310
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,526
Lrrr, why are you
yelling softly

311
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:55,927
with the
purple-furred one?

312
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,130
Uh, it's nothing, my queen.

313
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,299
He messed up my hair.

314
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,001
I'm missing a leg.

315
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,469
We fought like hell, sir,

316
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:05,971
but in the end, we caved

317
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,006
like a house of soufflé cards.

318
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,975
Got it. Peace with honor.

319
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,276
Well, I resign again.

320
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:12,577
Come, Nixon.

321
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,679
Introduce me to
the kitchen staff.

322
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,717
I must lay down the law
about Lrrr's low-sodium diet.

323
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,452
You've got
to tell her the truth.

324
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,354
And lay off the salted peanuts.

325
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,056
I'm just trying to get the
leg taste out of my mouth.

326
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:29,327
Lrrr, I'm in here now,
not out there!

327
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,729
Give me a little time.

328
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:33,131
With a lady like NDND,
one must use finesse.

329
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,333
Uh, coming, gigantums.

330
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:06,198
Mmm. That's crisp.

331
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,500
Yes, but no more so than your

332
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,969
squamous dorsal plates
in the moonlight.

333
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,704
Ooh...

334
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,240
I am experiencing arousal.

335
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,908
My organs are moving
into position.

336
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,109
Ooh.

337
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:29,621
NDND, there's something
I've got to tell you.

338
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,957
What is it? Is
there someone else?

339
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,560
What? Oh, no, no, it's about
this takeover of earth.

340
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,362
It's, it's...

341
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,165
The spark that
reignited our marriage?

342
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,466
Yes, exactly.

343
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,201
Good night.

344
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,147
Oh, lord, now what?

345
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,350
I couldn't tell her the truth.

346
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,318
Look, you scaly crybaby,

347
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,587
you do what I say
and you do it now!

348
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:05,056
I knew it!

349
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:09,160
Frying pans,
cast-iron frying pans.

350
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,595
It's not what it looks like.

351
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,197
What do I do?

352
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,332
Do what I say.
Tell her!

353
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,500
Tell me what?

354
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,502
Give me the heavy one.

355
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,138
The invasion was all a fake.

356
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,140
I just wanted to impress you.

357
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,475
You lied?

358
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,443
What else have you
been hiding from me?

359
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,649
What else?
Nothing else.

360
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,616
I still want you, Lrrr,

361
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:34,627
ng to fight for you.

362
00:17:34,695 --> 00:17:37,597
All I got left is a
colander and a pie pan.

363
00:17:37,664 --> 00:17:40,132
Lrrr?

364
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,201
Look, we only had one date.

365
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,703
I barely mated with her.

366
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,204
Whatever.

367
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,272
I harbor no resentment
against her.

368
00:17:49,343 --> 00:17:50,776
What I want to know is

369
00:17:50,844 --> 00:17:53,145
what is up between you
and bossy boots here.

370
00:17:53,213 --> 00:17:54,347
Her?

371
00:17:54,414 --> 00:17:55,948
She's just a bossy friend.

372
00:17:56,016 --> 00:17:57,516
Exactly.

373
00:17:57,584 --> 00:17:59,552
She nagged you, tormented you,
and pushed you around.

374
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,220
That is my job!

375
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,022
This must be settled.

376
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,625
I demand the ancient ritual of

377
00:18:05,692 --> 00:18:07,927
rrmmr-mr-fr-mrh
or consequences.

378
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:11,831
Rrmmr-mr-fr-mrh or what?

379
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,075
Let the ritual begin.

380
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,211
The rules are the same
as in the home version:

381
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:28,581
Lrrr must simply choose
between myself and leela.

382
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,316
Fine, hurry up.

383
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:31,717
By shooting the one he rejects.

384
00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:34,529
Whoa!

385
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:36,397
Lrrr, I'm getting angry.

386
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:37,665
Don't you go through with this.

387
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:39,467
She is not the boss of you.

388
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,369
I am the boss of you.

389
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,373
Uh, um, oh.

390
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:47,208
Leela's going to die.

391
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:49,243
What would delivery-boy man do?

392
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:58,486
I-I do not want
to shoot anybody.

393
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,088
You never want to do anything!

394
00:19:00,155 --> 00:19:01,556
Oh, nag, nag, nag.

395
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:04,258
You want me to stop
nagging? Then shoot me.

396
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:05,693
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

397
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:08,096
Beats staring
at your fat ass on the couch.

398
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:09,797
Oh, yeah?
I'll show you.

399
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:14,435
Ray-blocking power.

400
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,612
Fry.

401
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:29,717
Lrrr, you were willing to
shoot that bossy temptress.

402
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:33,888
You really do value my
nagging above all others.

403
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:44,131
Good night, dumb prince.

404
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:46,100
Come back, Lrrr!

405
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:48,535
I want to have your popplers!

406
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:50,904
There'll never be
anyone but you!

407
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:53,040
Hello.

408
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,441
Of course I'll marry you.

409
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:56,610
Wait, what the shmell happened?

410
00:19:56,678 --> 00:20:00,147
I thought NDND disintegrated
you with this ray gun.

411
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:01,649
Pfft, it's just
a cheap teleporter.

412
00:20:01,716 --> 00:20:03,951
I bought it out of the back
of a comic book.

413
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:05,152
Cha-ching!

414
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,320
The teleporter gun?

415
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:08,422
That means Fry might still be...

416
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,158
Fry?
Fry?

417
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:12,326
Is this him?

418
00:20:13,628 --> 00:20:15,496
Fry, you're alive.

419
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:17,131
Not only that.

420
00:20:17,198 --> 00:20:20,401
I now know exactly
how to end my comic book.

421
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:22,102
Let's watch.

422
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,004
Say good-bye
to your forehead

423
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:26,073
'cause I'm going
to shoot you in it.

424
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,642
Not if I leap
in front of your death ray,

425
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,511
and I am going to do that.

426
00:20:30,578 --> 00:20:32,379
Jumping sound!

427
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:33,747
I didn't shoot yet.

428
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:37,618
As usual,
your delivery arrived too soon.

429
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:44,291
Oh, delivery-boy man,
you saved me by random chance.

430
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,327
Don't thank random chance.

431
00:20:46,394 --> 00:20:50,431
Thank my meteor-wishing power
with your lips.

432
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:53,534
Mmm...

433
00:20:53,601 --> 00:20:56,804
Good ending...
not great.

434
00:20:56,871 --> 00:21:06,972
