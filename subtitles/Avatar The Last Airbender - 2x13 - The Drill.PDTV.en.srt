00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:02,468
Water

2
00:00:03,941 --> 00:00:04,941
Earth

3
00:00:05,622 --> 00:00:07,235
Fire

4
00:00:08,227 --> 00:00:09,227
Air

5
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:13,413
Long ago,the four nations lived together in harmony

6
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:17,741
then everything changed when the firenation attacked

7
00:00:19,037 --> 00:00:22,687
Only the avatar mastered all four elements could stop them

8
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:25,767
but when the world needed him most he vanished

9
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:29,823
100 years passed, my brother and I discovered the new avatar

10
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,836
airbinder named Aang

11
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,336
And although his airbinding skill is great,

12
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:37,122
he has a lot to learn before he is ready to save anyone.

13
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:40,839
but I believe...
... Aang can save the world

My name's Jet. I've done some things in my past that I'm not proud of.

17
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:59,267
But that's why I'm going to Ba Sing Se, for a new beginning.

18
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:03,845
I can't believe how many people's lives have been uprooted by the Fire Nation.

19
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:08,910
We're all looking for a better life. Safe, behind the walls of Ba Sing Se.

20
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:14,338
-So why are you guys getting tickets for the ferry?
-Appa is missing, we hope to find him in Ba-Sing-Se.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,050
I'll find Appa as fast as I can.

22
00:01:23,896 --> 00:01:26,872
Sorry, Momo, Appa's gonna have to wait.

Book two: Earth
Chapter thirteen: The Drill

24
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,420
This drill is a feat of scientific ingenuity and raw destructive power.

25
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,645
Once it tunnels through the wall,

26
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,220
our troops will storm their city.
The Earth kingdom will finally fall,

27
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:40,410
and you can claim Ba Sing Se in the name of your father.

28
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,410
Nothing can stop us.

29
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,600
Hmm. What about those muscle-y guys down there?

30
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,155
Please

31
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,070
the drill's metal shell is impervious to any earthbending attack.

32
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,040
Oh, I'm sure it is War Minister Ching. But just to be on the safe side?

33
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:02,620
Mai, and Ty lee, take the earthbenders out!

34
00:03:02,655 --> 00:03:05,320
Finally, something to do.

35
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,750
Aang, what are you doing here? I thought you were looking for Appa?

36
00:03:15,785 --> 00:03:19,410
I was, but something stopped me. Something big.

37
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,410
Now what's so big that Appa has to wait?

38
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,380
That

39
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,410
We made it to Ba Sing Se, and we're still not safe.

40
00:03:37,445 --> 00:03:38,890
No one is.

41
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,120
What are you people doing here?

42
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:43,210
Civilians aren't allowed on the wall.

43
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,980
I'm the Avatar. Take me to whoever's in charge.

44
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,100
It is an honor to welcome you to the outer wall young Avatar,

45
00:03:52,135 --> 00:03:54,260
but your help is not needed.

46
00:03:54,295 --> 00:03:55,792
Not needed?

47
00:03:55,827 --> 00:03:57,290
Not needed.

48
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,565
I have the situation under control.

49
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,680
I assure you the Fire Nation cannot penetrate this wall.

50
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,920
Many have tried to break through it, but none have succeeded.

51
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,110
What about the Dragon of the West? He got in.

52
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:19,260
Well...uh...technically yes. But he was quickly expunged.

53
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:24,000
Nevertheless, that is why the city is named Ba Sing Se.

54
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,880
It's the impenetrable city.

55
00:04:26,915 --> 00:04:29,370
They don't call it Na Sing Se.

56
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,295
That means penetrable city.

57
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,100
Yeah, thanks for the tour, but we still got the drill problem.

58
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,195
Not for long. To stop it, I've sent ...

59
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,020
an elite platoon of earthbenders called the Terra Team.

60
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,220
That's a good group name, very catchy.

61
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,160
Ready! Attack!

62
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,770
We're doomed!

63
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,745
Get a hold of yourself man!

64
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,920
You're right, I'm sorry.

65
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,190
Maybe you'd like the Avatar's help now?

66
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,040
Yes, please.

67
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,890
The question is, how are we gonna stop that thing?

68
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,470
Why are you all looking at me?

69
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,275
You're the idea guy.

70
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,270
So I'm the only one who can ever come up with a plan?

71
00:05:57,305 --> 00:05:58,475
That's a lot of pressure.

72
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,180
And also the complaining guy.

73
00:06:00,215 --> 00:06:01,420
That part I don't mind.

74
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:10,670
So, Mr. Lee, and Mr.... umm Mushy is it?

75
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:12,475
It's pronounced Moo-shee.

76
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,750
You telling me how to do my job?

77
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,385
no, no.

78
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:23,020
But may I just say that you're like a flower in bloom, your beauty intoxicating.

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,470
You're pretty easy on the eyes yourself handsome.

80
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,790
Welcome to Ba Sing se.

81
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,900
I'm gonna forget I saw that.

82
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,595
I think Lee would make a good Freedom Fighter.

83
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,660
He's just trying to find his way in the world, like us.

84
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,995
You don't know anything about him Jet.

85
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,590
I know he didn't get that scar from a waterbender.

86
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,115
Besides, I thought we were going straight now?

87
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,380
We are, and the new Freedom Fighters could use a guy like Lee.

88
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,170
What do you think Longshot?

89
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,770
I can respect that.

90
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,000
What's wrong with him? He doesn't look injured.

91
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:07,750
His Chi is blocked.

92
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,135
Who did this to you?

93
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,855
Two girls ambushed us,

94
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,165
one of them hit me with a bunch of quick jabs,

95
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,080
and suddenly I couldn't earthbend, and I could barely move

96
00:07:18,115 --> 00:07:19,680
and then she cart wheeled away.

97
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,375
Ty-Lee

98
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,260
She doesn't look dangerous, but she knows the human body and it's weak points.

99
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:28,820
It's like she takes you down from the inside.

100
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,575
Yes£¿

101
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,185
What you just said,

102
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,895
that's how we're gonna take down the Drill.

103
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,860
The same way Ty lee took down all these big earthbenders.

104
00:07:37,895 --> 00:07:39,910
By hitting its pressure points!

105
00:07:41,863 --> 00:07:44,723
We'll take it down from the inside.

106
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:57,290
Once I whip up some cover, you're not gonna be able to see, so stay close to me.

107
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:05,611
Run!

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,108
Hey, look at that dust cloud.  It's so...poofy. Poof!

109
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,330
Don't worry Princess. I'm sure it's nothing.

110
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,650
Everyone into the hole!

111
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,450
It's so dark down here, I can't see a thing.

112
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,820
Oh no, what a nightmare.

113
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:41,820
Sorry.

114
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,400
There!

115
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,325
Toph, Come on!

116
00:08:57,325 --> 00:08:59,825
No way am I going in that metal monster. I can't bend in there.

117
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,490
I'll try to slow it down out here.

118
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:04,210
Okay, good luck.

119
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,960
I need a plan of this machine. Some schematics that show what the inside looks like.

120
00:09:17,995 --> 00:09:20,087
Then we can find it's weak points.

121
00:09:20,122 --> 00:09:22,180
Where are we gonna get something like that?

122
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,160
What are you doing!? Someone's gonna hear us!

123
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:26,315
That's the point.

124
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,520
I figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it,

125
00:09:29,555 --> 00:09:31,152
and when something breaks...

126
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:32,750
They come to fix it.

127
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,770
Hi!

128
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,030
This'll work, thanks!

129
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,250
It looks like the Drill is made up of two main structures.

130
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:54,470
There's the inner mechanism, where we are now,

131
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,985
and the outer shell.

132
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,470
The inner part and the outer part are connected by these braces.

133
00:09:58,505 --> 00:10:00,990
If we cut through them, the entire thing will collapse.

134
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,710
So, you guys got plans once you're inside the city?

135
00:10:08,745 --> 00:10:12,600
Get your hot tea here! Finest tea in Ba Sing Se!

136
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,220
Oh! Jasmine, please.

137
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,093
Blaugh! Ugh. Coldest tea in Ba Sing Se is more like it.

138
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,230
What a disgrace!

139
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,950
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

140
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,750
You and I have a much better chance of making it in the city if we stick together.

141
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:40,562
You want to join the Freedom Fighters?

142
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:43,305
Thanks, but I don't think you want me in your gang.

143
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:48,610
Come on, we made a great team looting that Captain's food. Think of all the good we could do for these refugees.

144
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,950
I said no.

145
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,240
Have it your way.

146
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,135
Hey!

147
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,975
What are you doing firebending your tea?

148
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,000
For a wise old man, that was a pretty stupid move.

149
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,620
I know you're not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but

150
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,380
.. that's so sad.

151
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,810
Wow, it looks a lot thicker in person than it does in the plans.

152
00:11:24,845 --> 00:11:27,105
We're going to have to work pretty hard to cut through that.

153
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,410
What's this we stuff? Aang and I are going to have to do all the work.

154
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:35,680
Look, I'm the plan guy, You two are the "cut stuff up with waterbending" guys.

155
00:11:35,715 --> 00:11:37,830
Together, we're Team Avatar!

156
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,430
C'mon team, don't quit now, we're...

157
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,260
I mean, you're almost there.

158
00:12:15,493 --> 00:12:19,520
At this rate, we won't do enough damage before the drill reaches the wall.

159
00:12:19,555 --> 00:12:21,530
I don't know how many more of those I have in me.

160
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,140
Do you hear that? We took it down. We better get out of here fast!

161
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,480
Congratulations crew, the Dill has made contact with the wall of Ba Sing Se.

162
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,360
Start the countdown to victory!

163
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,150
C'mon brace, budge!

164
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,000
This is bad, really bad.

165
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,520
We're putting everything we've got into busting these braces, but it's taking too long!

166
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,645
Maybe we don't need to cut all the way through.

167
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,660
Toph has been teaching me that you shouldn't give 100% of your energy into any one strike.

168
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:34,832
Sokka, take a fighting stance.

169
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:36,935
You've gotta be quick and accurate.

170
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,220
Hit a series of points, and break your opponent's stance.

171
00:13:40,255 --> 00:13:43,095
And when he's reeling back, you deliver the final blow

172
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,300
His own weight becomes his downfall. Literally.

173
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,800
So we just need to weaken the braces, instead of cut all the way through.

174
00:13:50,835 --> 00:13:54,250
Then I'll go to the top of this thing, and deliver the final blow.

175
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:56,930
And boom, it all comes crashing down!

176
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,520
Everyone inside that wall, the whole world, is counting on us.

177
00:14:02,555 --> 00:14:05,200
The whole world, minus the Fire Nation that is.

178
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:12,290
C'mon twinkle toes, hurry up!

179
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,770
That's enough, we need to get to the next one!

180
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,045
War Minister, an engineer was ambushed! His schematics were stolen!

181
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,810
War Minister, a brace on the starboard side has been cut clean through! It's sabotage sir!

182
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,710
Let's go ladies.

183
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:53,230
Good work Team Avatar. Now Aang just needs to ... DUCK!

184
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:02,032
Wow Azula, you were right, it is the Avatar! ...and friends.

185
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,990
hey

186
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,020
Guys get out of here, I know what I need to do.

187
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,500
Wait! You need this water more than I do!

188
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,500
Follow them, the Avatar is mine.

189
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,130
Slurry pipeline? What does that mean?

190
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,300
It's rock and water mixed together, it means our way out.

191
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,805
Ughh, disgusting!

192
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,380
Come on, you heard Azula. We have to follow them.

193
00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:01,110
She can shoot all the lightning she wants at me, I am not going in that wall sludge juice.

194
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,530
Why don't you try blocking my chi now circus freak!

195
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:45,025
Katara, keep that up.

196
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,930
The pressure will build up in the drill, then when Aang delivers the final blow, it will be ready to pop!

197
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,750
This looks like a good spot Momo.

198
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:10,250
General Sung, tell your soldiers to stop shooting rocks down here!

199
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,190
Soldiers, whatever you do, don't stop shooting rocks down there!

200
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,145
Good technique little sister!

201
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,835
Keep it up! Don't forget to breathe!

202
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,790
You know, I am just about sick and tired of you telling me what to do all day.

203
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,680
You're like a chattering Hog-Monkey!

204
00:17:40,715 --> 00:17:42,770
Just bend the slurry woman!!

205
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,430
You guys need some help?

206
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,640
Toph, help me plug up this drain!

207
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,570
What I'd give to be a metal bender.

208
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,570
Momo, get out of here!

209
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,750
Thanks Momo, I owe you one.

210
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,670
Now all I need is a......

211
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,540
Actually, that is what I needed for once.

212
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,810
Here it comes!

213
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,480
We lost.

214
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,275
Last call for Ba Sing se!

215
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:32,740
Jet, relax! So the old guy had some hot tea. Big deal.

216
00:22:32,775 --> 00:22:37,340
He heated it himself! Those guys are firebenders.

217
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,430
What a handsome baby.

218
00:22:50,465 --> 00:22:52,080
Thank you.

219
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,690
I just want to say, good effort out there today Team Avatar.

220
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:18,035
Enough with the Team Avatar stuff.

221
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,000
No matter how many times you say it, it's not gonna catch on.

222
00:23:21,035 --> 00:23:22,405
How about...

223
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,345
the "Boomerang Squad",

224
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,740
see it's good cause it's got "Aang" in it.

225
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,010
Boomer- Aang

226
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,590
I kinda like that one.

227
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,260
Let's talk about this on our way into the city.

228
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,400
The "Aang Gang"?

229
00:23:33,435 --> 00:23:34,445
Sokka

230
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,850
The "Fearsome Foursome"?

231
00:23:35,885 --> 00:23:36,855
You're crazy.

232
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,400
Why? We're fearsome!

233
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:43,732
