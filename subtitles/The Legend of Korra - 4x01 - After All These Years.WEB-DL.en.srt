And of course, my biggest
thanks goes to Asami Sato

26
00:01:22,213 --> 00:01:23,246
and future industries.

27
00:01:23,247 --> 00:01:26,916
She brought our old central
terminal into the modern era.

28
00:01:26,917 --> 00:01:30,820
Ladies and gentlemen, the
world is entering a new age

29
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:32,255
of peace and prosperity.

30
00:01:32,256 --> 00:01:35,659
Soon, Prince Wu will
take his rightful place

31
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,260
on the Earth Kingdom throne,

32
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:39,763
and thanks to our updated rail system,

33
00:01:39,764 --> 00:01:41,798
Republic City and the Earth Kingdom

34
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,500
will be united like never before.

35
00:01:49,307 --> 00:01:51,508
Hey there, Asami right?

36
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,742
Great train house.

37
00:01:52,743 --> 00:01:55,145
Maybe you can give me a
personal tour sometime,

38
00:01:55,146 --> 00:01:56,012
what do you say?

39
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:58,882
I do like the idea of
putting you on a train

40
00:01:58,883 --> 00:02:01,351
and sending you far, far away.

41
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:04,120
That's... that's funny.

42
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:05,655
I like funny dames.

43
00:02:05,656 --> 00:02:07,290
Maybe I should introduce myself,

44
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,025
I'm Prince Wu, future king.

45
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:12,028
Yeah... I'm aware of who you are.

46
00:02:12,029 --> 00:02:14,030
Don't let my reputation intimidate you.

47
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:16,800
I'm still human just like everyone else,

48
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:20,570
only more human, like extra-human,

49
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:21,905
or, hmm, super-human.

50
00:02:21,906 --> 00:02:23,707
Super-human?

51
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:24,874
So, what do you say?

52
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,176
Can I show you a low-key night out

53
00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:30,246
with a super-human soon to be king?

54
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:33,650
Prince Wu, President Reiko
has some really important

55
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:35,618
king stuff to talk to you about.

56
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:38,755
Now? Fine.

57
00:02:38,756 --> 00:02:42,158
Think over the offer, I'll be back.

58
00:02:43,627 --> 00:02:45,328
He's a real charmer, huh?

59
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:47,664
He's... something.

60
00:02:47,665 --> 00:02:49,366
How can you stand being his bodyguard?

61
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:53,269
Well, I just remind myself
that once he's on the throne,

62
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,004
I go back to being a detective.

63
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:56,673
- And that works?
- I also go home

64
00:02:56,674 --> 00:02:58,608
and smash my head into
the wall for an hour.

65
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:00,276
You know, just to get the stress out.

66
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:04,280
It's good to see you,
Mako. It's been too long.

67
00:03:04,281 --> 00:03:05,715
You hear from Bolin lately?

68
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:07,016
I haven't talked to him for a while,

69
00:03:07,017 --> 00:03:08,651
but he's coming in a few
days for the coronation.

70
00:03:08,652 --> 00:03:11,688
And Bei Fong told me that
Korra is getting in tonight.

71
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:13,256
I can't wait to see her.

72
00:03:13,257 --> 00:03:15,892
It's gonna be weird
having the old team avatar

73
00:03:15,893 --> 00:03:18,528
back in the city after all these years.

74
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:21,131
After your coronation the united forces

75
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:22,999
will escort you to Ba Sing Se.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,933
Right, about that.

77
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:26,169
Are we all positive that the Earth Kingdom

78
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,704
is safe enough for me to return?

79
00:03:27,705 --> 00:03:29,639
I don't have to remind
everyone what happened

80
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,808
to my great aunt three years ago?

81
00:03:34,812 --> 00:03:35,845
May she rest in peace.

82
00:03:35,846 --> 00:03:39,215
Prince Wu, I assure you
Kuvira has the Earth Kingdom

83
00:03:39,216 --> 00:03:42,085
pretty much stabilized at this point.

84
00:03:42,086 --> 00:03:43,586
Define: "pretty much. "

85
00:03:43,587 --> 00:03:47,757
Well, the roving bandits
have mostly been dispersed.

86
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:48,625
Mostly?

87
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:49,292
Don't worry kid.

88
00:03:49,293 --> 00:03:52,862
The chances of you being
assassinated are almost zero.

89
00:03:52,863 --> 00:03:54,531
Almost?

90
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:06,242
Get out of here.

91
00:04:06,243 --> 00:04:09,579
We don't have anything left.

92
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:22,058
Now, you don't have anything left.

93
00:04:54,825 --> 00:04:56,826
It's safe to come out everyone,

94
00:04:56,827 --> 00:04:58,094
the airbenders are here.

95
00:04:58,095 --> 00:05:00,530
You finally made it.

96
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:02,699
So, where are the rest of you?

97
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,667
Actually, it's just the two of us,

98
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:07,837
but we're going to do
everything we can to help.

99
00:05:07,838 --> 00:05:09,639
I'm Opal, and this is Kai

100
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,040
- it's nice to meet you.
- What?

101
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,510
I called Master Tenzin
because my state has been

102
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:15,245
under siege by bandits for months.

103
00:05:15,246 --> 00:05:19,582
They blocked all the roads,
cut off our supply lines,

104
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,485
and all he sent is you two kids?

105
00:05:22,486 --> 00:05:23,319
Hey, us two kids

106
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,954
just took care of those three guys for you.

107
00:05:24,955 --> 00:05:27,657
There are hundreds more
where they came from.

108
00:05:27,658 --> 00:05:28,858
My citizens are going hungry.

109
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:32,061
Our entire state is on
the brink of collapse.

110
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:34,130
Unfortunately, the air nation is

111
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:35,765
spread thin right now.

112
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:38,468
We're all you have.

113
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:48,811
We just got some good news.

114
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:51,915
Two more Earth Kingdom
states have agreed to join us.

115
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,984
Excellent. Thank you, Bolin.

116
00:05:54,985 --> 00:05:57,687
We're 90% there, Kuvira.

117
00:05:57,688 --> 00:05:58,922
That's great!

118
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:03,693
Julie, dish out some of
that special celebration tea.

119
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:09,933
None for me.

120
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:12,669
I won't celebrate until the Earth Kingdom

121
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,438
is 100% reunited.

122
00:06:25,783 --> 00:06:27,183
Why have we stopped?

123
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:30,119
Apologies, there are rocks on the tracks.

124
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,187
It's most likely bandits.

125
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:33,790
We're sending troops
to handle the situation.

126
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:34,657
Call them off.

127
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:38,027
I will take care of the bandits myself.

128
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:14,932
- Gah!
- O-wah!

129
00:07:17,702 --> 00:07:20,437
- Aah!
- Oww!

130
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:23,774
- Ahh!
- Argh!

131
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:25,876
Ugh, ooh!

132
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:35,386
- Ehh!
- Ack, ohh!

133
00:08:02,947 --> 00:08:04,648
You're... Kuvira.

134
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:06,950
And you're the bandits
who have been causing chaos

135
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:10,621
where I am trying to
establish order, aren't you?

136
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:11,622
We're sorry.

137
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:13,223
We didn't know this was your train...

138
00:08:13,224 --> 00:08:16,193
Don't talk over me

139
00:08:16,194 --> 00:08:18,962
Please, take mercy on us.

140
00:08:18,963 --> 00:08:22,766
Stop groveling as if this is
the worst day of your life.

141
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:24,134
This is a good day.

142
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:26,470
I'm gonna give you all the opportunity

143
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:27,805
to rehabilitate yourselves

144
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:31,442
and become productive
members of your nation.

145
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:33,544
Right now, you're lost,

146
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:34,845
but pledge your loyalty to me,

147
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:37,281
and I'll give you a new
purpose in your lives.

148
00:08:37,282 --> 00:08:38,982
Of course, if you don't want to join,

149
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:40,951
you could always stay right here.

150
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:42,086
Hopefully someone saves you

151
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:44,088
before the next train speeds through,

152
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,256
but I wouldn't count on it.

153
00:08:46,257 --> 00:08:47,191
No, we'll join.

154
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:48,058
Don't leave us here.

155
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:53,030
We pledge our loyalty to you, great uniter.

156
00:09:00,004 --> 00:09:05,242
♪

157
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:07,258
I don't know why we're leaving so early

158
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:08,178
if you're just getting a haircut.

159
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:11,048
The dinner at air temple island
isn't until later tonight.

160
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:12,983
Because I'm not just getting a haircut.

161
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:13,984
It's a spa day.

162
00:09:13,985 --> 00:09:16,587
We're talking minimum four hours.

163
00:09:16,588 --> 00:09:17,588
Are you kidding me?

164
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:20,290
What are you having done
that takes four hours?

165
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,860
A rejuvenating tea leaf skin wrap.

166
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:24,695
Have you ever gotten one of those, Mako?

167
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:27,765
Yeah, I'm not interested.

168
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:30,634
Oh, you will be.

169
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,538
So while your hands soak
in a bubbling milk bath,

170
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:37,241
your feet are in a tub full
of these little suckerfish

171
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:39,343
that literally eat your calluses away.

172
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:42,212
Gobble them right up. Crazy, huh?

173
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:43,313
That's disgusting.

174
00:09:43,314 --> 00:09:46,183
Then they scrape your skin
with blocks of sea salt,

175
00:09:46,184 --> 00:09:48,252
lube you up with seaweed infused aloe,

176
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:50,354
wrap you in tea leaves,
put you in a hot box

177
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:52,990
for four hours and bam, you're done!

178
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:56,727
Mako, look at all my fans.

179
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:58,796
They must be in town for my coronation.

180
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:04,201
Uh, I don't know if all
those people are your fans.

181
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:07,838
Boo!

182
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:08,972
Yeah!

183
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:15,479
All right, Wu!

184
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:27,524
Wu, we have to get you out of here.

185
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:30,594
What?

186
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:36,567
Go, go.

187
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:37,734
What just happened out there?

188
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:41,305
I think those were Kuvira
supporters in the crowd.

189
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:43,774
Oh, no! Mako, I've been hit.

190
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:44,808
It's a gusher.

191
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:48,979
That's not blood, it's strawberry pie.

192
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,746
Hmm.

193
00:10:49,747 --> 00:10:52,883
Oh, yeah, you're right. But that was close.

194
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:55,319
I don't know what would've
happened if you weren't there.

195
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,321
You would've been hit by a pie.

196
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:59,189
It's really not that big of a deal.

197
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,357
Or I could've been killed.

198
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:02,860
I don't know what I'd ever do without you.

199
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:06,196
Wait a second, did you say strawberry pie?

200
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:08,999
I'm allergic to strawberries.

201
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,634
I don't think I can breathe.

202
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:12,870
Get me to the hospital, Wu down.

203
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:15,772
You're allergic to bee stings.

204
00:11:15,773 --> 00:11:16,707
Oh, right.

205
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,642
I always get those two mixed up.

206
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:21,979
Look! A train made it through.

207
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,915
Maybe they brought food and supplies.

208
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,258
Hey, what's your boyfriend doing here?

209
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:37,327
If he's here, he must be
with Kuvira and my brother.

210
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:39,596
This isn't going to be good.

211
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:42,599
- Bolin!
- Kai!

212
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:46,637
Wow, you are a lot heavier
than you used to be,

213
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:47,771
you're really growing up.

214
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:49,106
What's up with your new hair?

215
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:50,040
You look like a stiff.

216
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,609
Hey, Kuvira says it
makes me look intelligent

217
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,443
and professional.

218
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:55,979
Don't believe everything she says.

219
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,616
Opal, I can't believe you're here too.

220
00:11:59,617 --> 00:12:01,084
I missed you so much.

221
00:12:01,085 --> 00:12:03,086
I missed you, too.

222
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:04,888
Look who it is.

223
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:07,524
It's good to see you again, little sister.

224
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:08,725
What a wonderful surprise.

225
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:11,361
A happy reunion for my favorite couple.

226
00:12:11,862 --> 00:12:12,862
How's mom doing?

227
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:16,065
Like you care. She still
hasn't forgiven you.

228
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:19,235
You know, for someone who
claims to be so enlightened,

229
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:21,103
mom can really hold a grudge.

230
00:12:21,104 --> 00:12:23,639
I guess when her son betrays her.

231
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,273
Please.

232
00:12:24,274 --> 00:12:25,775
Opal. We're not here to bicker with you

233
00:12:25,776 --> 00:12:27,376
about something that
happened three years ago.

234
00:12:27,377 --> 00:12:29,912
We're here to help this
town, just like you.

235
00:12:29,913 --> 00:12:32,748
I've heard how you help
towns by conquering them.

236
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:35,117
I know the rumors about
me can be pretty nasty,

237
00:12:35,118 --> 00:12:38,988
but I am giving everyone in
this nation a better future,

238
00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:41,223
and with Bolin's help
and my fiancé's ideas,

239
00:12:41,224 --> 00:12:43,893
we're laying the groundwork
for the people to achieve

240
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:44,927
their own greatness.

241
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:48,331
- Your fiancé?
- You haven't heard?

242
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:50,766
Your brother and I are getting married.

243
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:53,069
Isn't that great, sweetie?

244
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,004
I know things got heated with your family

245
00:12:55,005 --> 00:12:56,339
when Baatar and I left Zaofu,

246
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,977
but don't you think it's
time to forgive and forget?

247
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:03,679
What are you doing here?

248
00:13:05,282 --> 00:13:07,950
Hello, Governor. I was wondering if you

249
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:09,719
and I could talk privately.

250
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,124
So, have you had time to
rethink my generous offer?

251
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:18,761
Generous? You want to take everything.

252
00:13:18,762 --> 00:13:19,795
How is that generous?

253
00:13:19,796 --> 00:13:22,832
Governor, your state has
been overrun by bandits.

254
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,001
They have you outnumbered
and out-supplied.

255
00:13:25,002 --> 00:13:29,605
The question's not if
they'll take over, it's when.

256
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:31,173
Unless you sign our deal.

257
00:13:31,174 --> 00:13:34,477
Agree to our terms and
you'll have the full force

258
00:13:34,478 --> 00:13:35,978
of my army backing you.

259
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:39,915
You will remain in charge,
just under my supervision.

260
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:43,552
I will save your life, and
the lives of your citizens.

261
00:13:43,553 --> 00:13:47,556
I think that's pretty generous.

262
00:13:47,557 --> 00:13:49,759
I know how you manipulate states

263
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,028
and force them to join up under you.

264
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:55,598
I know the only reason you want this region

265
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:57,666
is because it's rich in ore.

266
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,969
They might call you "The Great Uniter,"

267
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,171
but you're destroying everything.

268
00:14:02,172 --> 00:14:06,275
I'll never turn the great state of Yi

269
00:14:06,276 --> 00:14:09,645
over to you.

270
00:14:09,646 --> 00:14:10,713
You have a lot of pride,

271
00:14:10,714 --> 00:14:12,281
but it cannot protect your people.

272
00:14:12,282 --> 00:14:14,116
Your pride will not stop the hordes

273
00:14:14,117 --> 00:14:15,818
as your city crumbles to the ground,

274
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:18,621
and your pride certainly
will not feed your hungry

275
00:14:18,622 --> 00:14:21,791
when all that is left is rubble.

276
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:24,160
Leave! Get out of my state.

277
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:25,928
You will perish,

278
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:29,565
unless you take my generous offer.

279
00:14:37,474 --> 00:14:39,909
It's time to go, we're not wanted here.

280
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,843
What happened?

281
00:14:40,844 --> 00:14:43,145
It appears we can't make a deal right now.

282
00:14:43,146 --> 00:14:46,148
Wait, aren't you guys
gonna stick around and help?

283
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:50,786
Here's the contract, we'll
wait at the border for one day.

284
00:14:50,787 --> 00:14:52,288
You get the governor to sign it,

285
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:57,293
and you'll have all the help you need.

286
00:14:57,294 --> 00:14:59,829
I guess I gotta go.

287
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,696
Don't, please!

288
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:02,798
You can't turn your back on these people.

289
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:03,399
I'm not.

290
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,468
I want to help, but if
the governor wants us gone,

291
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:07,870
there's-there's nothing I can do.

292
00:15:07,871 --> 00:15:10,206
I'm sorry... hey!

293
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:11,774
Opal, please.

294
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:15,711
Leave if that's what you're going to do.

295
00:15:22,786 --> 00:15:25,154
You know, we might not
need their help after all.

296
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:27,823
The roads may be impassable,
but not the skies.

297
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:30,726
We can use lefty to fly
to all the nearby villages,

298
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:32,628
pick up supplies and fly back.

299
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:33,362
You're right.

300
00:15:33,363 --> 00:15:37,500
We can save this town ourselves.

301
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:43,672
Sorry we couldn't give you
more, that's all we could spare.

302
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:44,740
Every little bit helps.

303
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:47,076
Because of you and the
other farmers around here,

304
00:15:47,077 --> 00:15:49,111
we have more than enough
food to feed the town

305
00:15:49,112 --> 00:15:53,282
until we can get some reinforcements.

306
00:15:53,283 --> 00:15:55,751
Thanks.

307
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:02,124
So... you and Bolin doing okay?

308
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,058
I don't know.

309
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:05,995
It's really tough having a
long-distance relationship,

310
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:09,098
and I can't stand that
he's working with Kuvira.

311
00:16:09,099 --> 00:16:10,065
I can tell.

312
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:12,801
But it does seem like he
found his calling, doesn't it?

313
00:16:12,802 --> 00:16:13,969
He loves helping people.

314
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,006
Maybe, it's just he's changed a lot

315
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:18,240
since he's been around her.

316
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:19,208
He's growing up.

317
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:23,145
I just hope we're not growing apart.

318
00:16:23,146 --> 00:16:25,748
Speaking of long-distance relationships,

319
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:27,049
how are you and Jinora doing?

320
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,851
Actually, we're doing fine.

321
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:34,390
You hear that?

322
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:37,526
It's more bandits.

323
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:44,600
We're hooked.

324
00:17:18,702 --> 00:17:19,902
No!

325
00:17:19,903 --> 00:17:23,672
Ah!

326
00:17:26,743 --> 00:17:29,945
Whoa!

327
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:59,041
What happened? Where's all the food?

328
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:02,344
We were attacked in mid
air. We lost everything.

329
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:06,181
It might be time to make a tough call.

330
00:18:18,895 --> 00:18:21,730
Here, tell Kuvira to save my people.

331
00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:25,634
For what it's worth, I think
you made the right decision.

332
00:18:25,635 --> 00:18:29,838
Did I ever really have a choice?

333
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:36,745
When Korra gets here, I bet she's not even

334
00:18:36,746 --> 00:18:39,948
gonna know who I am. Why is that?

335
00:18:39,949 --> 00:18:42,051
Because Meelo the boy

336
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:46,255
has turned into Meelo the man.

337
00:18:46,256 --> 00:18:49,925
Right, you're completely unrecognizable.

338
00:18:49,926 --> 00:18:52,861
You've never
had the tea leaf wrap?

339
00:18:52,862 --> 00:18:54,997
You have no idea what you're missing.

340
00:18:54,998 --> 00:18:57,132
The face massage alone is to die for.

341
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:59,935
Ugh. This coronation
cannot some soon enough.

342
00:18:59,936 --> 00:19:03,005
I can't wait to go back
to being a detective.

343
00:19:03,006 --> 00:19:07,109
Right. Um, yeah, about that.

344
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,177
What?

345
00:19:08,178 --> 00:19:10,245
I don't know how to tell you this.

346
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:13,248
You're going to Ba Sing Se with the prince.

347
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:14,016
No!

348
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:16,719
I tried to get you out of
it, but it's over my head.

349
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,854
Wu personally asked Raiko.

350
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:21,223
He said he doesn't know
what he'd do without you.

351
00:19:21,224 --> 00:19:22,358
This can't be happening.

352
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,859
I'm not even an Earth Kingdom citizen.

353
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,829
I work for the Republic
city police department.

354
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,830
Not anymore.

355
00:19:27,831 --> 00:19:29,498
You're just a pawn in
Raiko's diplomatic game.

356
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:31,367
You can try talking to
him, but I don't think

357
00:19:31,368 --> 00:19:33,969
he's going to let you quit.

358
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:37,873
There's a Southern water tribe
ship pulling up to the dock.

359
00:19:37,874 --> 00:19:40,609
Korra!

360
00:19:58,862 --> 00:20:01,432
- Cool!
- Yeah!

361
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:13,876
The state of Yi is now under
the full protection of my army.

362
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:22,384
Proclaim your loyalty, if
you wish to keep your post.

363
00:20:22,385 --> 00:20:29,057
I pledge my loyalty to you, great uniter.

364
00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:56,585
Tonraq, it's good to
have you back in the city,

365
00:20:56,586 --> 00:20:59,121
and everyone is excited
to see the avatar again.

366
00:20:59,122 --> 00:21:02,825
What do you mean? Isn't Korra already here?

367
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:05,227
No, we thought she was coming with you.

368
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:08,430
Korra left the south pole six months ago.

369
00:21:08,431 --> 00:21:09,698
She's written me letters.

370
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:11,700
She said she was here in Republic City.

371
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:15,270
I assure you, your daughter's not here.

372
00:21:15,271 --> 00:21:17,940
Then where is she?

373
00:21:29,085 --> 00:21:32,588
Is that all you got?

374
00:21:42,632 --> 00:21:47,636
Unh!

375
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:49,304
Unh.

376
00:21:49,305 --> 00:21:54,076
We have a winner.

377
00:21:55,211 --> 00:22:00,015
Here, for your lackluster participation.

378
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:00,682
Thanks.

379
00:22:00,683 --> 00:22:03,085
You know, you look very familiar.

380
00:22:03,086 --> 00:22:07,256
Yeah, you kind of look
like that avatar girl.

381
00:22:07,257 --> 00:22:08,657
I get that a lot.

382
00:22:08,658 --> 00:22:11,527
Whatever happened to her anyway?

383
00:22:11,528 --> 00:22:12,770
I wouldn't know.

384
00:22:12,771 --> 00:22:19,453
