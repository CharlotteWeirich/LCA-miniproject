[Rayla] <i>Previously on</i> The Dragon Prince...

5
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:22,604
A letter?

6
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:28,653
You'll understand in time.
I want you to break the seal when...

7
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,490
Well, you'll know when.

8
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:47,964
[gasps]

9
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,176
What is this place?

10
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:57,974
Wait.

11
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:01,227
Callum, I need to tell you something.

12
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,524
I know what happened.
He's gone.

13
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,610
Oh, no.

14
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,697

[roaring]

16
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,985
[Rayla] Callum, I'm sorry.

17
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,029
I tried to tell you the king was dead.

18
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,575
My stepdad.
He was more than just the king to me.

19
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,451
Your stepdad. I know.

20
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,288
I really tried,
but I could never find the right way.

21
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,583
And whenever I tried, I messed it up,
and the next time was harder, until...

22
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,961
Rayla, just stop.
I can't talk about this right now.

23
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:52,714
All I can think about is
how I'm going to tell Ezran

24
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:53,965
our father is gone.

25
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:59,387
I'm sorry, Callum.
I'm so, so sorry.

26
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,106

- [sighs]
- [footsteps approach]

30
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,983
So, have fun on your little date?

31
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,069
[sniffling and sobbing]

32
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,907
What happened?
What did he do to you?

33
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,827
Nothing happened.
Callum would never hurt me.

34
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:06,829
Oh.

35
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,959
Then how come you're all weep-ridden?

36
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,419
[scoffs] That is not an emotion, Soren.

37
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,713
My point is, are you okay?

38
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,758
Yeah. I'm gonna be fine.

39
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,720
[sighs] Because you're my sister,
as you know.

40
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:29,269
I'm always here for you...
to punch someone, or whatever you need.

41
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,813
- I know.
- Good.

42
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,482
We still have to bring the princes
back with us.

43
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,776
Whatever it takes, whatever happens.

44
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,612
I need to know that all this

45
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,906
won't get in the way
of doing what we came here to do.

46
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,200
It won't. I can do it.

47
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,259
Callum?

48
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,260
Morning, Ez.

49
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,638
- I had another weird dream.
- [Bait croaks]

50
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,934
I was running from that giant hippo.
The one made of taffy, remember?

51
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,728
- Uh, I think so?
- [Zym chitters]

52
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,814
Only this time,
there was someone riding on his back.

53
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,650
It was the baker.
The one who didn't like me.

54
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,695
He'd like you
if you stopped stealing his jelly tarts.

55
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,156
He said I was wanted
for crimes against dessert.

56
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,784
And to make the hippo chase me,
the baker told him I was jelly-filled.

57
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,620
- Ez...
- I was a pastry fugitive, Callum.

58
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,872
It was terrible.

59
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:36,669
And the worst part was he was right.
I was delicious.

60
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,088
Let's go for a walk.

61
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:45,344
So, Ezran,
I wanted to talk to you about...

62
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,306
life, and growing up

63
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:54,103
and how sometimes there are changes
you don't expect.

64
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,314
Is this the talk about sandwiches?

65
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,317
No. No, no, no. No, not that.
No, definitely not that.

66
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,652
Uh... [clears throat] Mmm.

67
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:06,199
Ezran, for a long time,
I treated you like a little kid.

68
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,326
And that wasn't fair.

69
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,497
You've grown up so much,
and I'm really proud of you.

70
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,458
Oh. Yeah.

71
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,741
[Callum] But when you grow up,

72
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,421
sometimes you have to face things
you're not ready for.

73
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,547
[Ezran] I know.

74
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,550
You know?

75
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,930
I know everyone's counting on me
to teach Zym how to fly.

76
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,556
- But that's just the start.
- [sighs]

77
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,768
Someone's gonna have to teach him
all the things he's supposed to do.

78
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,603
Everything he's supposed to be.

79
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:40,108
And he's meant to learn it all
from a big, strong King of the Dragons.

80
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,402
[Phoe-Phoe screeching]

81
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:47,907
But he doesn't have that.
All he's got is me.

82
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,576
Hey, don't be so hard on yourself, Ez.

83
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,163
I know it'll be tough,
but no matter what, you've got us.

84
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:58,459
Me and Rayla, probably Bait.
We're all here for you.

85
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,795
Thanks, Callum. That means a lot.

86
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,006
But I really wish Dad was here.

87
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,927
I keep wondering what he would do.
What he would say to Zym.

88
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,472
When I was little
and I wasn't listening to him,

89
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,517
Dad would say, "Ezran, you're a handful."

90
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,771
So, I tried to do that with Zym.
"Azymondias, you're a handful."

91
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,858
But he doesn't understand.
He doesn't even have hands.

92
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:27,071
I guess I just miss Dad.
He'd know what to do, you know?

93
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,825
Callum, what's wrong?

94
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,204
Nothing, Ez. I just really miss him, too.

95
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,634
I couldn't do it.

96
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,678
I couldn't tell him.

97
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,513
Callum...

98
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,308
And I understand why you couldn't tell me.

99
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,437
When you care about someone,
it's hard to hurt them.

100
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,356
Even when
what you're telling them is the truth.

101
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,152
I still should've told you.
You had the right to know.

102
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,697
I think maybe I did know.
Deep down, I knew.

103
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,784
I just hoped, if I didn't think about it,
maybe somehow, it wouldn't be true.

104
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,831
But he's gone. He's really gone.

105
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,500
[sobbing]

106
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,512
[Viren snoring]

107
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,148
The fire.

108
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,322
Huh.

109
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,585
[gasps]

110
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,098
No, no, no!

111
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,520
[exhales and groans]

112
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,522
Who are you?

113
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,067
When Soren said that Dad wanted us home,

114
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,902
- you knew he was lying.
- Yeah.

115
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,322
Unless, maybe Soren
was also trying to protect our feelings.

116
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,741
Oh, right. He definitely seems like

117
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,412
a thoughtful, sensitive,
feelings-y, protect-y kind of guy.

118
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,164
Yeah, you're right,
that's not really his style.

119
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,750
We don't have a choice anymore.
We have to leave.

120
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,419
And we have to do it now.

121
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:50,131
Get as far away from them as we can
before they even realize we're gone.

122
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,883
Whoa, wait a minute.
They're still my friends.

123
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,176
But they lied to you.

124
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,846
Soren lied to me.
Claudia told me the truth.

125
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,529
- We can't just leave.
- [Claudia] Leave?

126
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:04,937
Yeah. I'm sorry, but we've decided.
We're leaving today.

127
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,982
This mission,
taking the Dragon Prince back to Xadia,

128
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,526
it's the most important thing
we'll ever do.

129
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,903
- We can't go home with you.
- Oh.

130
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,701
Are you sure? I mean,
your dad is gonna be really disappointed.

131
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:22,413
- Soren, what is wrong with you?
- I'm just trying to...

132
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,457
Don't! Stop it, Soren.

133
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,586
Ugh, fine. Do what you want.

134
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,009
[yelping]

135
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,345
Stupid moths.

136
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,097
I'm sorry about him.

137
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,725
But before you go, Callum,

138
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:46,562
I have something I need to give you.
In private.

139
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,607
Oh. Uh, all right.

140
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,240
So, closed door? Open door?
What's... What do you...

141
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,117
Uh, closed is fine.

142
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,745
Closed. Good. Okay.

143
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:09,001
I have something for you.
Something you dropped.

144
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:13,047
That's my letter. From him.

145
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,091
You didn't open it?

146
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,135
Why would I do that?
It's for you.

147
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,139
Though, I mean, for the record,
I could have opened it

148
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,141
and pretty easily
re-sealed it with magic.

149
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,518
Wait, did you?

150
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,770
Did I? We may never know.

151
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:28,979
But, no. No.

152
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:34,068
So, are you going to open it?

153
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,654
No. I don't think I'm ready yet.

154
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,948
But thank you, Claudia.

155
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,492
You're welcome.

156
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,621
So, I guess this is goodbye.

157
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,673
Zym, come on.
You loved it in there as an egg.

158
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:57,758
Rayla, look.

159
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,009
[laughs]

160
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:02,221
He can't fly yet,
but he should be safe in...

161
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,560
- [Zym growls]
- Hey, how'd you...

162
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,813
- Bait, you're not helping.
- [croaks]

163
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,523
[Rayla laughing]

164
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,278
Let me guess. Once I was gone,

165
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:21,073
she tried to manipulate you
and convince you to go back home again.

166
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,408
No, she didn't.

167
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,160
Actually, Claudia really understands

168
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,495
how important it is
to get Zym back to Xadia.

169
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,415
Oh. That's surprising.

170
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,708
- [Callum] Mmm-hmm.
- But good.

171
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:36,630
Yeah. In fact, she understands it so well
that she and Soren want to come with us.

172
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,176
What? That is the worst possible plan.

173
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,595
How? How is it bad?
They're offering to help.

174
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,472
Or it's a trap.

175
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,557
[sighs]

176
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,019
[sighs] Callum, I know you trust them.

177
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,229
But if we let them come with us,

178
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,149
by the time we know the truth,
it'll be too late.

179
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,528
Do you understand? We'll lose everything.

180
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,947
So, then what are we supposed to do?

181
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,159
How can we figure out
if it's help or a trap?

182
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,047
- [loud banging]
- Can I help you?

183
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,260
I'm sorry.
Were you meditating or something?

184
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,344
I was.

185
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,681
So, you're done. Good.

186
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:34,522
We're leaving. And the other humans,
they're coming with us.

187
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:38,067
Hmm. And you're unhappy with that.

188
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,987
Callum trusts them,
but I know they're hiding something.

189
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:47,826
You see, to every truth,
there is a dark, shadowed side.

190
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,539
- Consider the half moon...
- You already did this.

191
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:55,584
Oh. Have I? Hmm.
Well, that's really all I've got.

192
00:13:55,668 --> 00:14:00,130
Unless you're in need of a spooky monster
or fake food. Hmm?

193
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:04,301
Actually, there is something
you can do for me.

194
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,388
[Soren] Oh, yeah.

195
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,641
[grunting]

196
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,018
Where are Callum and Ezran?

197
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,981
Oh, they'll be here soon.
Ezran's still packing up his dragon.

198
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,150
It has been a pleasure
to have you all here.

199
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:24,655
I truly have enjoyed
you all sneaking past my defenses

200
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:28,534
and desecrating this sacred place
these past few days.

201
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:33,622
It will be lonely. Quiet...
but lonely without you.

202
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,499
I'll miss you so much.

203
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,670
- Ellis, you will always be welcome here.
- [barking]

204
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,339
[laughs] And you, too, little one.

205
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:47,303
You don't need the illusion any longer,
but I hope it serves as a reminder

206
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,306
that someone
is always looking out for you.

207
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,730
Okay, everyone's here now.
We can all hit the road.

208
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,568
All right. Time to go to the magical land
and do whatever.

209
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,919
So, you're ready to do this
the Soren way, right?

210
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,755
Yes, there's no other way.

211
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,759
Good. Then, when it's time to strike,
I'll give the signal.

212
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,010
What's the signal?

213
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,847
The signal is me attacking the elf.

214
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,932
[Claudia groans]

215
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,605
It's going to be a long journey.

216
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,399
Let me just go around this bush-corner

217
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,319
and see if I can find
some berries or something.

218
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,170
[Rayla grunts]

219
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,507
- Oh, no. It's a trap.
- Yup.

220
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,968
But why? I thought we were friends.

221
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,678
Sorry, but no.

222
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:14,264
I'm just a nice guy
and people get the wrong idea sometimes.

223
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,644
[sighs] You don't speak sarcasm so good,
do you?

224
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,270
No, I do not.

225
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,065
[yells]

226
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,826
[chanting indistinctly]

227
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,583
- [Ava whimpers and barks]
- Wait, Ava! Come back.

228
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,210
[snakes hissing]

229
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,426
[Zym whimpering]

230
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,565
I'm sorry, little guy.
You have to come with me.

231
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,399
[Viren gasps]

232
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,402
You can't see me.
On your side...

233
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,947
it's just an ordinary mirror.

234
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,452
[Soren and Rayla grunting]

235
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,003
What? You're running away?

236
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,300
Hey! Do either of the tiny princes
want to fight?

237
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,052
This elf is a coward.

238
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:23,936
I'm sorry. I know this feels
like a betrayal, but I can't let you go.

239
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,815
I have to do what's right.
I have to take you back home.

240
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,736
Please don't give me
the silent treatment, Callum.

241
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,740
Say something! Say you hate me.
Say anything.

242
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:46,999
[gasps]

243
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:51,255
Soren, something's wrong!
This is a trick!

244
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,633
A trick? Us? No.

245
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,388
- Sarcasm!
- Right.

246
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,890
What did you do, elf?

247
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,144
I can't wait for the look
on your big, stupid face

248
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,311
when you see this.

249
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,857
- Ellis, show them.
- [Ava barks]

250
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,735
Here's your moment, Ava.
Moonstone collar trick.

251
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,292
- They're illusions.
- [Soren] What?

252
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,544
You're saying they're not real?

253
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,131
- That's what "illusions" means, Soren.
- [Ellis laughing]

254
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,383
[both howling]

[Soren grunts]

256
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,016
- Not even close! [laughs mockingly]
- [grunts]

257
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,894
[panting] Where are the real princes?

[Ezran whooping]

260
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,143
- [Soren] Claudia, they're getting away.
- [Rayla grunts]

261
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,908
No, they're not.

[Phoe-Phoe screeching]

Claudia, please! Don't do this.

[Bait croaks]

267
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,729
- [screams]
- Stop! Let them go.

268
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,320
What are you doing?

269
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,572
Protecting them from you! [grunts]

270
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,951
Big mistake, chain man.

271
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,620
[Phoe-Phoe screeches]

272
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,638
- [Ava barking]
- [Ellis] Goodbye! I'll miss you guys.

273
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:08,100
Don't you forget about me.
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

274
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,689
We got 'em! I was right.

275
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,441
Yeah, you were right.

276
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,570
I wish I wasn't. I'm sorry.

[grunts]

280
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,228
You know
you're going to pay for this, traitor.

281
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:21,965
Traitor? General Amaya sent me
to protect the princes of Katolis,

282
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,675
and you just tried to kidnap them.

283
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,763
Everyone who votes "Corvus is a traitor"
raise their hand.

284
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,185
Two against one, traitor.

[muffled grunting]

286

What are we gonna do?

287
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,693
We betrayed our friends,
and it was all for nothing.

288
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,030
It wasn't for nothing. Look.

289
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:50,869
[gasps] The dragon!
We still have the dragon.

290
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,789
Come on out, you little...

291
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:57,751
[grunting] I hate the Moon. Ugh!

292
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,763
It's okay, Zym.
It's safe to come out now.

Wanna see how flying feels?

298

Come on, spread your wings.
