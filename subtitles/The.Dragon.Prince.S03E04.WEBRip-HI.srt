But, Rayla, you need to know.
The Dragon Queen is dying.

6
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,861
We have to get to her. It's the only way.

perhaps she'll hold on.</i>

Ethari, can I ever come home again?

10
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,798
Xadia has attacked the human kingdoms.
All of us.

11
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,675
There must be a proportionate response.

12
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,843
War.

13
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:56,222
What? No. The people of the human kingdoms
and Xadia want peace.

High Mage, I've brought someone

This is fine.

Not really.

26
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,919
Back when I was a kid, my family used to
do this thing called "big feelings time."

27
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,172
You close your eyes, and ask yourself
if you have any big feelings.

28
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,316
Then you say them out loud,

29
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,192
and the other person says
they hear your feelings,

30
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,343
and it makes you feel good.

31

I'm just saying,
you've been through a lot lately.

35
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,650
It would be understandable
if you had some...

36
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,318
Leave me alone.

37
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,153
...big, big feelings.

38
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:01,324
If you don't stop pestering me
about this right now,

39
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,494
I'm going to give you a big feeling
on the side of your head.

Prince Kasef of Neolandia

I'm here to deliver an ultimatum.

00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,821
It means I'm forcing you to make
a final decision.

45
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,948
I know what an ultimatum is.

46
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,120
Does this thing have more pieces?

47
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,169
Katolis and Neolandia were not
the only kingdoms attacked.

48
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,881
The King of Del Bar
and Queen of Evenere were slain.

49
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,176
Their people are angry and want justice.

50
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,013
They are ready to wage war on Xadia.

51
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,433
- Their armies have arrived in Katolis.
- [advisors gasp]

52
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,977
You dare violate our borders!

We do.

54
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,273
Here is your ultimatum.

55
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,569
If you will not stand with us,
then you stand in our way.

56
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:26,367
King Ezran, we can show Xadia the strength
and righteousness of the human kingdoms.

57
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,328
Four armies, joined as one!

58
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:33,374
Enough! I've already told you.
Katolis will not wage war on Xadia.

59
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:39,255
Then tomorrow at dawn,
three armies will wage war on Katolis.

[Zym whimpers]

69
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:07,802
Greetings, travelers.
My name is Naimi-Selari-Nykantia.

70
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,804
But they call me "Nyx."

71
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:14,058
Hi, Nyx. My name's Rayla.
They call me "Rayla."

72
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,687
And I'm in a bad mood.
Either you fly away now,

73
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,315
or I'm going to use these blades
to do something that's gonna cheer me up.

74
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,653
Ah, I should have guessed.
You're the banished Moonshadow elf.

75
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,114
[Rayla] What? What are you talking about?

76
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:31,033
[Nyx] I am an emissary
of the Dragon Queen.

77
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,287
She received your message,
and she sent me to help you.

78
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,247
I am at your service.

79
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,419
And you must be...

80
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,631
[in thick accent] I'm an Earthblood elf.
Oi!

81
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:51,220
Hmm. Message said you'd be
traveling with a human companion.

82
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,055
[in thick accent] Oh, does it, now?

83
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:01,189
[in normal voice] That was me all along!
I was the human.

84
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,272
[Zym chirps]

85
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:09,989
And there he is, the dragon of the hour.
Oh, and he has his mother's eyes.

86
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:15,536
I have been authorized by the Dragon Queen
to fly him directly home.

87
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,207
- [Rayla] That's not going to happen.
- [Zym chitters]

88
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,293
We're doing just fine on our own, Nyx.

89
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,925
I can get the baby dragon home fast,
and that's what matters most.

90
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,511
We're not letting you take Zym.

91
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,847
Whoa! Okay, okay, understood.

92
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,559
Well, how about this?
I can give you all a ride.

93
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,728
Not interested.

94
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:45,191
Are you sure? How do you plan
to cross the Midnight Desert?

95
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,695
Do we look stupid? We're not crossing
through the Midnight Desert.

96
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,905
We're going around it.

97
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:54,242
The Dragon Queen is dying,
and you would waste a week,

98
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,578
when I can take you straight across
in two days?

99
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,040
How?

100
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,167
Follow me.

101
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,463
[Zym chirps]

102
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:24,105
King Ezran, Kasef's threat is terrible,
but we can win.

103
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:25,690
What do you mean?

104
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,484
Your Aunt Amaya,
and your mother before her,

105
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,778
saw to it that our army
was the best trained

106
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,322
and most disciplined force
in the kingdoms.

107
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,577
The coming battle won't be easy,
but we will triumph.

108
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,371
[Bait croaks]

109
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,747
But at what cost?

110
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,168
The necessary cost. Many lives.

111
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,673
- How many?
- No one can say for sure.

112
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,426
- [angrily] How many?
- I don't know.

113
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,052
Give me an answer, a number.

114
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,306
Thousands. Probably tens of thousands.

115
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,811
- That's no triumph.
- [Bait groans]

116
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:11,444
[Nyx] The Midnight Desert is hot,
haunted, and horrifying.

117
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,863
The black sand soaks up the sun,

118
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,325
so in the daytime it's hotter
than any desert known to elf.

119
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,286
And the night is worse.

120
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,873
That's the haunted and horrifying part?

121
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,751
It's infested with soulfang serpents.

122
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:31,631
They suck the spirit out of their victims,
turning them into barely-living husks.

123
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,591
[Zym whimpers]

124
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,719
But we're going to be above all that.
Literally.

125
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,555
There she is.

126
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,642
That's my ride. An ambler.

127
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,188
[Callum exclaims]

128
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:03,496
[Nyx] She'll get us to the central oasis
by sundown, and we'll spend the night.

129
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,083
Then, tomorrow,
we come out the other side,

130
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,877
- and the baby dragon's almost home.
- [Zym chitters]

131
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,299
- What do you think?
- The Dragon Queen is dying.

132
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,926
And this is going to save us a week.

133
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,683
[Nyx] Okay, let's ride.

134
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,467
[Bait croaks]

135
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,014
- Thanks, Bait. That helps.
- [Bait grunts]

136
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,104
Each one of these pieces is 500 people.

137
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,984
Five hundred men and women.
Some are moms and dads,

138
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:21,115
and have kids waiting for them at home.
All of these are sons and daughters.

139
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,992
Sisters, brothers, friends.

140
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,995
- They're real people, Bait.
- [croaks]

141
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,248
And after the battle...

142
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,879
How can I let this happen?

King Ezran, forgive me.

146
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,056
There may be a way
to prevent this bloodshed.

147
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,225
You can save these lives.

- What?
- Nothing.

150
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,257
I was just wondering
what you're thinking about.

151
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,761
I'm fine, Callum. Like I already told you.

[exclaims]

153
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,225
[ambler grunts]

154
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,438
- [ambler groans]
- [Nyx] Ugh, great. Just great.

155
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,777
- [Callum] What happened?
- [Nyx] Her foot's stuck in a hole.

156
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,656
The soulfangs burrow under the ground
during the day and make all these tunnels,

157
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,492
and if too many are in one place,
the ground gives way.

158
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,578
I just need to go down
and get her foot out.

159
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,539
Don't touch my stuff.

160
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,719
What is it? Why you staring at that thing?

161
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,894
[ambler grunts]

162
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,524
Something's so strangely familiar...

163
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,360
Boomerang?

164
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,443
[exclaims]

165
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,365
[Nyx] Let's move.

166
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,968
[baker humming]

167
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,932
- [Ezran] Um, excuse me?
- Uh...

168
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,728
King Ezran? Is that you?

169
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,774
- [Ezran] We're down here.
- [Bait croaks]

170
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,363
Oh! Your Majesty.
I'm so sorry, I had the grate fixed.

171
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:10,075
Uh... Oh, let me just...
I'll break it for you. Stand back.

172
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,370
[grunting]

173
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,747
[exclaims]

174
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,753
[chuckles] Uh...
I'll be sure to leave it broken.

175
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,631
Would you like a jelly tart?

176
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,468
That's not why I'm here, but, yes, always.

177
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,767
[Bait grunts]

178
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,812
I need to ask you a favor.
Something very important.

179
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:44,735
If anything happens...
I mean, something might happen.

180
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:48,113
- And I need you to take care of Bait.
- [Bait croaks]

181
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:54,453
I am honored and... humbled.

182
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,044
You understand what he needs?

183
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,090
An infinite supply of jelly tarts, and...

184
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,592
understanding and love?

185
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,095
Yes. Mainly the tarts.

186
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,638
[croaks loudly]

187
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,933
Thank you.

188
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,063
[Bait groans]

189
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,492
[whimpers]

190
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:47,131
Now, I want you to know, I have always
seen you as a kindred spirit.

191
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,048
[Bait grunts]

192
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,222
[Nyx] There's the oasis.

193
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,685
It's not much, but it's a safe haven
from soulfangs and the husks.

194
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,186
How does it keep them out?

195
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:05,024
[Nyx] It's surrounded by obelisks
that create a circle of protection.

196
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,401
It's a magical barrier around the oasis.

197
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,404
Anyway, here's the Wonderwall.

198
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,180
[sighs]

199
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,809
Looks cozy enough.

200
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,978
[both gasp]

201
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,689
It gets really cold here at night,
so we'll need these.

202
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:50,736
I wasn't sure if you guys
needed two blankets or just one...

203
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,948
[exclaims] Two. Yeah, two.
'Cause if there was just one, then...

204
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,034
- [Rayla] Two.
- Two. Two.

205
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,786
Suit yourselves.

206
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:00,704
[chuckles nervously]

207
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,666
[ambler grunts]

208
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,892
[Aaravos] It is ready.

209
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,648
Open your eye.

210
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,577
You can hear me.

211
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,958
And now you can see me.

212
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,752
And I can better serve you.

213
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,797
[exclaims]

214
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,431
[snoring]

215
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,059
[Rayla sniffling]

216
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,064
Rayla? Did you say something?

217
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,275
- [sobbing]
- You okay?

218
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,404
- Rayla, it's okay.
- Get away from me!

219
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,666
Ezran, you don't need to do this.
There must be another way.

220
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,170
Don't worry, Corvus. I'll be okay.

221
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:35,299
King Ezran, are you sure?
There will be no going back.

222
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,303
I know what's right.
I know what I have to do.

223
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,679
[door opens]

224
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,812
- It's agreed. Everything you asked for.
- The battle?

225
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:52,566
It's been called off.
There will be no attack at dawn.

226
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,278
And what about the people
who no longer wish to fight at all?

227
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,573
They will be allowed
to lay down their arms,

228
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:04,453
and return to their families,
in peace and safety, as you insisted.

229
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:16,882
[sighs]

230
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,009
It's done.

231
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,471
Take him.

232
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,586
I'm so sorry it's come to this.

233
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,630
No, you're not.

234
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,551
No... I'm not.

235
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,649
[cell door slams]

236
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:06,199
[Rayla] Please leave me alone.
I don't want you to see me like this.

237
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,494
I don't care if you're crying.
I'm here with you.

238
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,747
I'm a mess.

239
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,833
- No, you're not. It's okay.
- I've lost everything.

240
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:19,796
My parents, the people who cared about me,
my home.

241
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,631
There's nowhere I belong now.

242
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,300
[Callum] That's not true, Rayla.

243
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,177
You're going through a hard time,
that's all.

244
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,431
That's not all!
It's me, and it's all my fault.

245
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,476
I failed them. I let them all down.

246
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,687
They're right to reject me.

247
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:41,318
- I'm not good enough, and I never will be.
- Shut up.

248
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:42,903
Wait, what?

249
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:46,615
Just shut up, you're talking crazy.
Just listen to me.

250
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,618
You're too good
to feel this bad about yourself.

251
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,329
I know that, and you should know that.

252
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,540
You have true courage and a big heart.

253
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,585
I've seen you get knocked down
so many times before,

254
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,296
and every single time, you get up again.

255
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,799
That's real strength.

256
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:07,761
And... and you're ten times funnier
than any human I know.

257
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,054
- [laughs]
- See?

258
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:14,476
See, you know you're amazing.
You're smart, and fast, and beautiful.

259
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,772
Rayla, you're the most amazing person
I've ever met.

260
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,158
That's not what I was expecting.

261
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:34,246
You were saying all those things,
so I thought...

262
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:37,916
No, I mean, I wasn't saying those things
so you would...

263
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:40,919
[gasps]

264
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:45,882
We will never speak of this again.
Do you understand?

265
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,527
Of course. Of course, yeah.
Of course I do.

266
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:52,806
No, I mean never. I will bind myself
to killing you if you even mention...

267
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,267
Why would I? [scoffs]

268
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,810
No. [chuckles nervously]

269
00:23:56,893 --> 00:24:00,981
- We walk away, and this never happened.
- Perfect.

270
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,197
- [gasps] Oh, no!
- [adoraburrs squeaking]

271
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,452
Where's Zym?
