1
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,660
Dad!

2
00:00:31,113 --> 00:00:32,713
You’re on your feet again.

3
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:34,061
Thanks to your sister.

4
00:00:34,532 --> 00:00:37,532
I’m in no shape to fight
but maybe there is someway I could help.

5
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,629
Everything’s going smoothly
and the eclipse hasn’t even kicked in yet.

6
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:46,859
Let’s hope our luck holds out.
Katara, you seem distracted. Is something wrong?

7
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:50,347
Yeah…. Is that… is that Aang?

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,600
What?

9
00:00:54,601 --> 00:01:00,101
Please tell you’re here because 
the Fire Lord turned out to be a big wimp
and you didn’t even need the eclipse to take him down

10
00:01:00,382 --> 00:01:05,782
He wasn’t home. No one was.
The entire palace city is abandoned.

11
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:07,969
They knew.

12
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:09,302
Aang: It’s over.

13
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:15,003
The Fire Lord is probably long gone. 
Far away on some remote island
where he’ll be safe during the eclipse.

14
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,270
No. My instincts tell me he wouldn’t go too far. He would have a secret bunker.

15
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:25,395
Somewhere he could go so it’ll be safe during a siege but still be close enough to lead his nation.

16
00:01:24,796 --> 00:01:29,296
If it’s an underground secret bunker we’re looking for,
 I’m just the girl to find it.

17
00:01:29,742 --> 00:01:31,442
The Mechanist gave me this timing device.

18
00:01:31,643 --> 00:01:35,943
It looks like we’ve got about 10 minutes until the full eclipse.
10 minutes to find the Fire Lord.

19
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:38,034
We can still do this. We can still win the day.

20
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:42,851
Wait. If they knew we were coming, it could all be a trap.

21
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:46,915
Maybe we should use the time we have left
 to make sure all of us get out of here safely.

22
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:51,275
Everyone who’s here today came prepared
 to risk everything for this mission.

23
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:52,985
They know what’s at stake.

24
00:01:53,434 --> 00:01:58,434
If there’s still a chance and there’s still hope,
 I think they would want Aang to go for it.

25
00:01:59,058 --> 00:01:59,558
What do you think?

26
00:01:59,568 --> 00:02:04,268
You’re the one who has to face the Fire Lord. 
Whatever you decide, I’m with you.

27
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,194
I’ve got to try.

28
00:02:15,224 --> 00:02:16,624
Do you feel anything down there

29
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:21,169
Yep. There are natural tunnels criss-crossing 
through the inside of the volcano.

30
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,990
Anything else? Is there a structure somewhere?

31
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,730
There’s something big, dense, and 
made of metal deep in the heart of the volcano.

32
00:02:30,974 --> 00:02:32,374
Sokka: Sounds like a secret bunker to me.

33
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:38,768
Aang: Stay safe. We’ll be back soon.

34
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:43,311
Toph: This way! That one’s a dead end.

35
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:44,912
Sokka: What would we do without you?

36
00:02:45,254 --> 00:02:46,854
Toph: Perish and burn in hot magma.

37
00:02:46,855 --> 00:02:48,255
Yeah, pretty much.

38
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:55,195
Toph: The tunnel continues on the other side and 
it leads right to the bunker.

39
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,470
Sokka: We’ll have to be fast but careful.

40
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:00,591
Aang: How was that careful?

41
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,230
Sokka: I was wrong. We need to be fast, careful and lucky.

42
00:03:11,095 --> 00:03:13,795
Sokka: There’s no floor! It’s just a river of lava.

43
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:17,151
Aang: Climb aboard and hold on tight.

44
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,480
Sokka: That’s some door!

45
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,009
Not a problem.

46
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,030
I am so glad we added you to the group.

47
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:19,717
Retreat! Everyone move to secondary defensive position! Retreat!

48
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:25,115
Bato: The eclipse is only minutes away.

49
00:04:25,573 --> 00:04:28,473
We should be able to make it up the hill 
by the time it starts

50
00:04:28,474 --> 00:04:31,974
and secure the entire palace by the time it’s finished!

51
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,451
We can wait here if you want.

52
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:40,952
No. I want to press forward with the others.

53
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:55,957
War Minister Qin: The Fire Lord’s chamber is that way down the hall to the left
and up the stairs. You can’t miss it.

54
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:57,721
Thanks.

55
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,475
Sokka: Only 30 seconds until the total eclipse.

56
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,092
I’m ready. I’m ready to face the Fire Lord.

57
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,820
Azula: So, you are alive after all.

58
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:31,264
I had a hunch that you survived.

59
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:34,965
It doesn’t matter, I’ve known about the invasion for months.

60
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:42,766
I’m ready to face you.

61
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:49,693
Fire Lord Ozai: Prince Zuko, what are you doing here?

62
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,440
The Mechanist: The eclipse is starting. 
Put on your eclipse glasses.

63
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,537
Fire Lord Ozai: Why are you here?

64
00:06:21,937 --> 00:06:23,237
I’m here to tell the truth.

65
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,539
Fire Lord Ozai: Telling the truth during the middle of an eclipse. 
This should be interesting.

66
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:38,828
Zuko: First of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was Azula who took down the Avatar, not me.

67
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:41,808
Fire Lord Ozai: Why would she lie to me about that?

68
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,476
Zuko: Because the Avatar is not dead. He survived.

69
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,420
What?!

70
00:06:46,837 --> 00:06:50,837
Zuko: In fact, he probably is leading this invasion. 
He could be on his way right now.

71
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,330
Get out! Get out of my sight right now 
if you know what’s good for you.

72
00:06:54,424 --> 00:06:57,824
That’s another thing.
 I’m not taking orders from you anymore.

73
00:06:58,353 --> 00:07:03,953
You will obey me 
or this defiant breathe will be your last!

74
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:09,231
Think again! 
I am going to speak my mind and 
you are going to listen.

75
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:14,256
Where is he? Where is the Fire Lord?

76
00:07:15,206 --> 00:07:18,906
Hm, you mean I’m not good enough for you?
 You’re hurting my feelings.

77
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:22,414
Stop wasting our time and give us the information.

78
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:25,485
You’re powerless right now, so you’re in no position to refuse.

79
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:29,008
And stick to the truth. I’ll be able to tell if you’re lying.

80
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:31,639
Are you sure? I’m a pretty good liar.

81
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:37,729
I am a 400 foot tall purple platypus bear with pink horns and silver wings

82
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:41,471
Okay you’re good, I admit it.

83
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,697
But you really ought to consider telling the truth anyway.

84
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,830
When I left Ba Sing Se,
 I brought home some souvenirs.

85
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:01,306
Dai Li agents.

86
00:08:15,826 --> 00:08:17,326
Bato: Surround the periphery!

87
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,313
We have to secure the palace
 by the time the eclipse is over.

88
00:08:20,777 --> 00:08:24,177
Otherwise, we’ll be in for the fight of our lives.

89
00:08:29,304 --> 00:08:32,604
Tyro: Stop! Surrender peacefully and we won’t harm you.

90
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,308
We’ll never surrender.

91
00:08:39,672 --> 00:08:41,072
Er okay, we surrender.

92
00:08:43,595 --> 00:08:48,115
Hakoda: There it is. The Fire Nation royal palace. We’ve come so far.

93
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,950
It’s not over yet.

94
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,970
Zuko: For so long, all I wanted was you to love me, to accept me.

95
00:08:57,099 --> 00:09:01,599
I thought it was my honor that I wanted but really, I was just trying to please you.

96
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,770
You, my father, who banished me just for talking out of turn.

97
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,591
(points a sword at Ozai) My father, who challenged me;

98
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,220
a 13-year-old boy to an Agni Kai.

99
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:14,678
How can you possibly justify a duel with a child?

100
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:16,642
It was to teach you respect.

101
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:18,981
It was cruel! And it was wrong.

102
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:20,735
Then you have learned nothing.

103
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:25,531
No, I’ve learnt everything! And I had to learn it on my own.

104
00:09:26,263 --> 00:09:30,263
Growing up, we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history..

105
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:34,855
and somehow, the war was our way of sharing 
our greatness with the rest of the world.

106
00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:40,883
What an amazing lie that was. 
The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation!

107
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:47,697
They don’t see our greatness, they hate us! And we deserve it.
We’ve created an era of fear in the world.

108
00:09:47,998 --> 00:09:55,298
And if we don’t want the world to destroy itself,
we need to replace it with an era of peace 
and kindness.

109
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:01,020
(laughs mocking) Your Uncle has gotten to you, hasn’t he?

110
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:04,147
Yes. He has.

111
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:30,665
I can’t pin her down. She’s too quick.

112
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:48,461
Wait! Aang, Toph, stop attacking.

113
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:51,885
Don’t you see what she’s doing? She’s just playing with us.

114
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:53,581
She’s not even trying to win this fight!

115
00:11:53,657 --> 00:11:55,857
Not true, I’m giving it my all.

116
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,879
You’re trying to keep us here and waste all our time!

117
00:11:58,898 --> 00:12:02,698
Um, right. I think your friend just said that genius.

118
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:06,582
And since you can’t see, I should tell you I’m rolling my eyes.

119
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,279
I’ll roll your whole head!

120
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:10,123
She’s just baiting you again.

121
00:12:10,516 --> 00:12:12,916
Okay, so what do we do? Just ignore her?

122
00:12:13,578 --> 00:12:14,878
We don’t have a choice.

123
00:12:14,893 --> 00:12:18,393
We just have to get out of here and 
find the Fire Lord on our own somehow.

124
00:12:19,124 --> 00:12:21,124
It’s a trap. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

125
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,174
Ignore!

126
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:29,388
So, Sokka’s your name right? My favorite
prisoner used to mention you all the time.

127
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,849
She was convinced that you were going to come rescue her.

128
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:36,228
Of course, you never came and she gave up on you.

129
00:12:40,138 --> 00:12:41,138
Come and get it…

130
00:12:47,804 --> 00:12:50,104
Where is Suki?!

131
00:12:52,274 --> 00:12:55,574
Zuko: After I leave here today,
 I’m going to free Uncle Iroh from his prison

132
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,190
and I’m going to beg for his forgiveness.
 He is the one who has been a real father to me.

133
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:06,071
That’s just beautiful. 
Maybe he can pass down to you the ways of tea and failure.

134
00:13:06,343 --> 00:13:09,443
But I’ve come to an even more important decision.

135
00:13:10,508 --> 00:13:14,008
I’m going to join the Avatar. 
And I’m going to help him defeat you.

136
00:13:14,356 --> 00:13:19,956
Really? Since you’re a full blown traitor now and
 you want me gone, why wait?

137
00:13:20,435 --> 00:13:25,035
I’m powerless, you’ve got your swords, 
why don’t you just do it now?

138
00:13:25,355 --> 00:13:29,955
Because I know my own destiny.
 Taking you down is the Avatar’s destiny.

139
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:32,956
(sheathes his swords) Goodbye.

140
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:37,945
Coward! You think you’re brave enough to face me 
but you’ll only do it during an eclipse.

141
00:13:38,123 --> 00:13:42,423
If you have any real courage,
 you’ll stick around until the Sun comes out.

142
00:13:43,098 --> 00:13:46,498
Don’t you want to know what happened to your Mother?

143
00:13:57,235 --> 00:13:58,735
What happened that night?

144
00:13:59,202 --> 00:14:06,502
My father, Fire Lord Azulon, had 
commanded me to do 
the unthinkable to you, my own son.

145
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:13,619
And I was going to do it.
 Your Mother had found out
and swore she would protect you at any cost.

146
00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:17,644
She knew I wanted the throne and she proposed a plan.

147
00:14:17,663 --> 00:14:23,763
A plan in which I would become Fire Lord and your life would be spared.

148
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,758
Where’s Suki? Answer me!

149
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:29,926
Sokka, she won’t talk.

150
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,630
Where are you keeping her?!

151
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:38,489
Your Mother did vicious, treasonous things that night.

152
00:14:38,552 --> 00:14:44,552
She knew the consequences and accepted them.
For her treason, she was banished.

153
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:45,767
So she’s alive.

154
00:14:46,568 --> 00:14:57,068
Perhaps. Now I realize that banishment is far too merciful a penalty for treason.
Your penalty will be far steeper.

155
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,783
Oh. Sounds like the firebending’s back on.

156
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:36,627
Dad’s all the way at the end of the hall and down the secret stairway on the left.
I’m sure he’ll be more than happy to see you now.

157
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:40,496
Sokka: I fell for it! I used up all our time.

158
00:15:40,593 --> 00:15:45,693
It’s not your fault, Sokka.
 Azula was ready for us.
 She had every move planned out.

159
00:15:46,704 --> 00:15:48,304
And now it’s too late.

160
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:54,097
Maybe it’s not too late. 
The eclipse is over but I can face the Fire Lord anyway.

161
00:15:54,508 --> 00:15:56,408
No. I don’t think that’s a good idea.

162
00:15:56,676 --> 00:16:00,276
But I’m ready! 
I came here with a job to do and everyone’s counting on me.

163
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:03,384
The Fire Lord knew we were coming this time.

164
00:16:03,418 --> 00:16:06,418
We thought we had surprise on our side but we didn’t.

165
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:10,098
It just wasn’t our day.
 What we need to do now is go help our friends.

166
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:12,155
I guess you guys are right.

167
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,904
You’ll have another chance. I know you will.

168
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:23,337
Bato: What should we do, Hakoda? 
Shouldn’t something have happened by now?

169
00:16:23,488 --> 00:16:24,788
I don’t know.

170
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:30,066
But now that the eclipse is over, I expect
we’re going to see some firebenders any minute.

171
00:16:38,394 --> 00:16:42,394
The Mechanist: My own invention. Oh this is terrible!

172
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:55,247
They’re back!

173
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:13,532
It was all a trap.
 Azula knew we were coming and she’s plotted out every move.

174
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,659
We just got to get to the beach as fast as we can.

175
00:17:16,723 --> 00:17:19,423
If we can make it to the submarines, 
maybe we can get away safely.

176
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:26,460
Aang: They’ve got air power, but so do I!
I’m going to do what I can to slow them down.

177
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:31,652
Katara: Appa, you and I can help too.

178
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:36,766
Everyone, let’s get back to the subs!

179
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:09,043
We can’t keep them all back. They’re too many of them!

180
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:10,963
Let’s join the others.

181
00:18:23,744 --> 00:18:24,744
Uncle!

182
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:31,104
Where is my Uncle?

183
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:34,845
Warden Poon: He’s gone. He busted himself out.

184
00:18:34,871 --> 00:18:38,771
I… I’ve never seen anything like it! He was like a one man army!

185
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,520
Try and find cover! I think we’re about to see some bombs.

186
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:11,036
Why aren’t they turning around to attack us again?

187
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,370
They’re headed for the beach. 
They’re going to destroy the submarines!

188
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:18,024
How are we all going to escape?

189
00:19:18,062 --> 00:19:19,062
We’re not.

190
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:25,082
Then our only choice is to stand and fight.
We have the Avatar, we could still win!

191
00:19:25,838 --> 00:19:29,738
Yes, with the Avatar we could still win on another day.

192
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,559
You kids have to leave. You have to escape on Appa together.

193
00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:37,659
What? We can’t leave you behind. 
We won’t leave anyone behind.

194
00:19:38,202 --> 00:19:40,602
You’re our only chance in a long run.

195
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:43,409
You and Sokka have to go with Aang somewhere safe.

196
00:19:43,507 --> 00:19:45,507
It’s the only way to keep hope alive.

197
00:19:45,574 --> 00:19:48,274
Bato: The youngest of our group should go with you.

198
00:19:48,413 --> 00:19:51,013
The adults will stay behind and surrender.

199
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,539
We’ll be prisoners but we’ll all survive this battle.

200
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:58,654
Tyro: I’ve got some experience with the Fire Nation prisons.

201
00:19:58,674 --> 00:20:01,174
It’s not going to be easy but we’ll get by.

202
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:02,248
They’re at the beach already!

203
00:20:43,328 --> 00:20:44,328
The Mechanist: Bye, son.

204
00:20:44,654 --> 00:20:47,154
Teo: Bye, Dad. I’m really proud of you.

205
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:52,852
The Duke: I’ll miss you, Pipsqueak.

206
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,419
Pipsqueak: Take care, The Duke.

207
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:58,174
Haru: I’ll be back for you Dad.

208
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:00,951
Tyro: If we don’t escape on our own first.

209
00:21:04,204 --> 00:21:07,604
We lost today but we’ve never been this close.

210
00:21:07,612 --> 00:21:11,012
We tasted victory and that counts for something.

211
00:21:11,281 --> 00:21:12,281
We’ll miss you Dad.

212
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:18,101
Bye Dad. We won’t be apart for too long this time. I promise.

213
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:34,837
Thank you all for being so brave and so strong. 
I’m going to make this up to you.

214
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,390
Captain: Should we follow them, Princess?

215
00:21:53,491 --> 00:21:57,491
No. They’re too fast.
 It doesn’t matter, they’ll be back.

216
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:05,850
I know just the place for us to go where
we’ll be safe for a while. The Western Air Temple.

217
00:22:19,701 --> 00:22:24,101
Tamat daaa!!! bersambung la pulak
