But, Rayla, you need to know
the Dragon Queen is dying.

10
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:51,801
- We have to get to her.
- If she knows her little one still lives,

perhaps she'll hold on.

I just have one question.

29
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,833
Now that we're in Xadia...
or should I say, New Katolis?

30
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,752
Or East Katolis?

31
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,005
Or Katol-east?

00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,465

You do not need to concern yourself
with the plan.

00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,225
I mean, you do have a plan, right?

36
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,687
My plan will be revealed
at the appropriate time.

37
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,189
I am a Crown Guard.

38
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,709
Shouldn't the leaders know
what's going on?

39
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,276
Enough, Soren!

40
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,113
[sighs] If you want to lead,
you need to learn how to follow.

41
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:22,785
And if you want to learn to follow,
you need to learn how to shut your mouth.

42
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,541
Perhaps you could look to Prince Kasef
for an example.

43
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,298
[Soren] You think you're so great,

- To fulfill your wishes, of course.

47
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:03,534
- Is your wish to rule Xadia?
- I wish for humanity to flourish.

48
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:07,038
And it cannot flourish
with a knife forever at its throat.

So, you wish to conquer Xadia?

No!

No, my goal is a bright future
for humanity.

Right.

53
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:26,099
And this bright future will require us
to conquer Xadia?

[Viren sighs]

Yes. Yes, perhaps.

The key to achieving your noble aims
for humanity is simple.

57
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,447
It's the same as it has always been.

58

The key is the Dragon Prince.

00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,452
Yes.

60
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:51,541
You must take down the Dragon Queen
and capture the baby dragon.

61
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,335
Then you will have the attention
of all the world,

62
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,629
and the power to do what you want.

But first, there is
something we need here in Lux Aurea.

64
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:07,807
You want us to attack the stronghold
of the Sunfire elves?

65
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,270
But we need to preserve our forces
for the final confrontation.

Viren, I'm nothing if not elegant
and efficient.

[Rayla] Yup.

[Callum] And I take it
the Dragon Queen didn't make her lair

at a nice kinda halfway-up there
kind of place?

Nope. Tip-top!

Your radiance, another human has come
to Lux Aurea.

He requests an audience.

81
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,043
You see, sister?

82
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,587
You bring one human,
and the next thing you know,

83
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,214
we are overrun with them.

84
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,381
Throw him in a cell.

85
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,510
But this human is the King of Katolis!

00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,512
Oh?

87
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,809
Then put him
in the extra-nice ring of fire.

88
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:38,648
Sister, this human claims he knows
what happened to Queen Aditi.

89
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,653
What does he know about our grandmother?

90
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,411
So, uh, when we get up there,

91
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,581
are we gonna tell
the Dragon Queen we're... a thing?

92
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,209
Uh, I don't think it's gonna come up.

93
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,504
Oh, I see.
You're saying we should hide it from her.

94
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:05,049
Kind of a secret,
forbidden-romance situation?

95
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,802
Yes. Yes, that's right.

96
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,346
The Dragon Queen must never know!

97
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,639
I understand.

98
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,560
The world just isn't ready
for what we have.

99
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,353
[Callum chuckles]

100
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,531
This is elven writing.

101
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,614
Can you read it?

102
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:30,908
It says...

103
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,662
"Prepare to draw your last breath."

104
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,520
What do you know of my grandmother?

105
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,024
Allow my people safe passage
through Xadia,

106
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,901
and you will know the truth.

107
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,778
[chuckles] Your people?

108
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:12,617
Do you bring farmers and poets,
or do you bring an army?

109
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:19,916
Humans bring nothing but trouble,
and you are like all the rest.

110
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,670
If you allow us to pass,
we have no trouble with you.

111
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,891
Hmm. We will see if we can trust you.

112
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,436
The Light will decide!

113
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,613
Look into the Light!

Ahh!

00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,061
Your true form is revealed.

118
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,648
Ugly and evil. I am not surprised.

119
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,650
[panting]

120
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,195
But don't give up hope,
you will be purified.

121
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,789
You know, I think this interrogation
is going very well.

122
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:42,915
You're not dead.

123
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,127
Bad news, my human friend.

124
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,921
Your king came seeking passage.

125
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,133
[interpreter] What? That's impossible.

126
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,176
[Janai] The Light
revealed his true nature.

127
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,223
Tainted with darkness, rotten to the core.
[scoffs] Such an arrogant man.

128
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,477
[interpreter] That man is no king.

129
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,232
<i>He may be the most dangerous human
in the world.</i>

130
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,655
No matter.
The queen sentenced him to be purified.

131
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,618
After the ritual, I doubt there
will be anything left of him.

132
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,788
[interpreter] You don't understand.

133
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,584
If he's here, everyone is in danger.
We have to stop him!

134
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,506
[yips]

135
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,387
[panting] How tall is this thing?

136
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:44,268
[panting] Maybe we should just rest here
for a second.

137
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,479
[both panting]

138
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:51,025
Guys, we can't stop here.
We have to keep going.

139
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,764
[Sunfire Queen] There is nothing
to be afraid of.

140
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,892
The light from the Sun Forge
is one of purification.

141
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:29,939
It will only remove the parts of you
that have been touched by Dark Magic.

142
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:33,943

The ritual has started!

145
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,137
[interpreter] We have to stop him!

146
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,398
Ugh! Humans disgust me.

147
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:20,489
Your kind could not be satisfied
with what you were given.

148
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,242
So you take what is not yours.

149
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:27,496
You take it within you,
and you turn it to filth.

150
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,043

[gasps]

154
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:17,338
Your arrogance is so predictable.

[yelling]

156
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:28,432
You allowed my vessel
to walk right into your court,

157
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:34,855
and then you brought him
directly to the source of all your power?

158
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,774
[laughs]

159
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:40,945
Oh, the irony is wonderful!

160
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,739
You're just like your grandmother.

161
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,160
Would you like
to know the truth of her fate...

162
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,162
before you face yours?

[screaming]

165
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,139
[shrieking] No!

166
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,309
[shouts]

167
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,814
[grunts]

168
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,328
[sobbing] No!

169
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,319
[all panting]

170
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,572
[panting] The air's so thin.

171
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,907
I can barely breathe.

172
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,577
Thanks.

173
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,997
[sighs] It's too much.

174
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,420
Zym, we can't leave them here.

175
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,800
I don't know if I can keep going.

176
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,637
Zym!

177
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,013
[grunts]

178
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,312
[slurping]

[chirping]

180
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,776
Zym, how long was I out?

181
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,152
[yips]

182
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,198
[growling]

183
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,005
Hey!

184
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,468
I've met you before, when you crashed.

185
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,804
You're okay now!

186
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,739
[panting]

187
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,327
I understand!

188
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:36,953
[yips]

189
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,502
[Claudia gasps]

190
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,727
[Soren] Dad?

191
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,655
I have been granted a great gift.

192
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:16,452
The power we need to defeat Xadia

193
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,039
and save humanity is now ours!

194
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,958
We must evolve.

195
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,170
When we strike against the Dragon Queen,

196
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:31,550
we will face elves and dragons,
and they will rain fire upon us.

197
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,968
[all exclaim]

198
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:38,515
But with this gift, I will inoculate you.

199
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,518
And instead of destruction,

200
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:45,731
that fire will be our nourishment!

201
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:49,068
Now, come forth.

202
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,862
[all murmuring]

203
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,409
Do not be afraid.

204
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,829
You will understand when you see the first
to change...

205
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,958
my own beloved son, Soren.

206
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,630
Step forward, my son.

207
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,882
Let me help you.

208
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,928
I don't wanna do this.

209
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,139
Step forward.

210
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,976
I... I'm afraid.

211
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,394
[Kasef] I am ready!

212
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,316
I am ready to receive the gift!

213
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,567
[all gasping]

214
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,968
[chanting]

215
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,256
[chanting continues]

216
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,100
[roaring]

217
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,314
[breathing heavily]

218
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,026
[roars]

219
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,039
Guys! Wake up! You gotta wake up!

220
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,334
I know how to fix everything.

221
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:14,129
The gateway wasn't a warning.
It was the solution!

222
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,590
What? What are you talking about?

223
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:21,094
To make it all the way up,
you have to draw your last breath.

224
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,388
[panting] It's a rune, Callum!

225
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,851
And the trigger words are <i>Ventus Spiralis.</i>

226
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,062
How do you know all this?

227
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,939
I met an old friend.

228
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,523
[sighs]

229
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,036
[panting]

230
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,583
<i>Ventus Spiralis!</i>

231
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,753
[inhales deeply]

232
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,259
[Bait groans]

233
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,681
Rayla, wake up! Come on!

234
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,140
[coughing]

235
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,602
We're gonna be okay!

236
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,067
Hey, that isn't part of the spell.

237
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,280
Uh, yeah! So, uh...
you were gone for a while,

238
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,573
and now, uh, this is a thing, so...

239
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,701
[Ezran] What?

240
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,578
Wha...

241
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,878
Soren. What's going on?
Where are you going?

242
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:41,091
I can't stay here anymore, Claudia.
You've seen what's going on.

243
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:45,304
What Dad turned Kasef into.
What Dad turned into.

244
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,431
Maybe he's just doing
what needs to be done.

245
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,268
Claudia, you're changing, too.

246
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,062
But it's not too late.

247
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,816
Come with me, Claudia. You can leave him!

248
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,528
Please, Soren, don't...
don't do this to me.

249
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,822
Don't make me choose. Not again!

250
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,410
Okay.

251
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,415
Good bye, Clauds.

252
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,498
No!

253
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,465
No! No, no, no!

254
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:35,312
Now, it is time for all of you
to embrace this power!

255
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,439
[roars]

256
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,362
[chanting loudly]

257
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,541
[chanting continues]

258
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,560
[growling]

259
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,574
[gasps]

260
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:44,923
We're here.

261
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,134
I can't believe we've made it!

262
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:04,359
We've brought him home.
Azymondias, the Dragon Prince!

263
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,278
He's here to see his mother.

264
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,658
It makes my heart leap
to see that he lives.

265
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,661
But you're too late.
