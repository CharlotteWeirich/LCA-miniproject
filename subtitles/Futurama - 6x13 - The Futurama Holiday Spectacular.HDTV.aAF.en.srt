00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,259
            Ah, the Xmas season.

6
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,261
    Who wants a delicious       
        unshelled nut?          

7
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,563
Ooh, I'll have one!             

8
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,700
          (loud crack)          

9
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,001
                       Mmm! Mmm!

10
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,904
            It's nut so good!

00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,606
        (groans quietly)        

12
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:41,640
              What's wrong, Fry?

13
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,109
              Are you regretting
            another wasted year?

14
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,445
I don't know.                   
Something about Xmas            

15
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,647
just doesn't feel               
like Christmas.                 

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,015
        (alarm blaring)         

17
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,250
        Santa's coming!         

18
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,285
    Initiate defenses!          

19
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,988
 (rattling, clanking, thudding) 

20
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:05,764
          God rest ye           
    merry gentlemen...          

21
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,966
        in peace.               

22
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,272
Can someone please explain      

23
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,808
    how you celebrate           
      this crazy holiday?       

24
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,576
      Preferably in song?       

25
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,178
         (others gasp)          

26
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,514
      It's the violent-est     
      season of the year       

27
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,584
 And Krinklebot has            
come dispensing mugs           

28
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,086
         Of Xmas fear         

29
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,187
     Sugarplummy visions      

30
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,555
 Will be dancing in your head 

31
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,690
     When I cane you           
    from the comfort           

32
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,459
          Of my sled          
                Ow!             

33
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:36,929
          On Xmas Eve,         
    we don our gay apparel     

34
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:38,297
         Kevlar vests         

35
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,132
       Asbestos stockings      
         and a barrel          

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,000
     And if grandma's          
        Xmas fruitcake         

37
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,669
     Finally reaches           
        critical mass          

38
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,170
     It can be re-gifted      

39
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,706
   Straight to Santa's ass    

40
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,909
 But the ornamental armaments 

41
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,644
 Are merely superficial       

42
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:56,181
  The tinsel and the trappings 
are just icing on the missile  

43
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,050
 The one thing that you need  

44
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,986
     To make your Xmas day     
        splendiferous          

45
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,387
     Is a pine tree           

46
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,023
          A pine tree          
      that's coniferous        

47
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:09,394
  We have to have a pine tree  
      that's coniferous!       

48
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,029
        You're welcome!         

49
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,398
             You know, Santa may
            have killed Scruffy,

50
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,567
                    but he makes
                a good point.   

51
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,570
        What we need is         
  an old-fashioned pine tree!   

52
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,838
    Cram it, Virginia!          

53
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,142
  Pine trees have been extinct  
      for over 800 years.       

54
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,176
LEELA:                          
Professor,                      

55
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,410
     maybe there's some way     

56
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,479
    to bring the pine trees     
         back to life.          

57
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,681
        Like we did with        
      the barking snakes.       

58
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,250
                     (barking)  

59
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,851
          Pine trees aren't     
        barking snakes!         

60
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:36,221
      They won't just turn up   
    in a salad at Olive Garden. 

61
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,756
     But there is one hope,     

62
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,859
 and, as usual, it's Norwegian. 

63
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,395
        (whirring)

    Ooh! Whoa! Oh! Whoa...!

            Behold!             

66
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,211
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault! 

67
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,147
     Since 2008, the vault      
      has preserved seeds       

68
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,583
 of every known plant species,  

69
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:05,817
     in case of extinction.     

70
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,020
             And I brought a few
                seeds of my own.

71
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,088
        (snakes barking)        

72
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,423
 Halt! Wh-What's your business

00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,792

    de seed vault, uh,

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,562
 guardian of mankind's precious 
    botanical heritage dere?    

75
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,698
    We just want to come in     
    and rummage about a bit.    

76
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,067
        Oh. So... okay.         

77
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,103
                Yo, Abba, what's
                 that next-door?

78
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,705
         (wind rushing)         

79
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,208
        GUARD: Oh, dat's de germ
             warfare repository.

80
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,576
                  LEELA:        
              It's so close.    

81
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,178
      Is there any chance       
    of cross-contamination?     

82
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,681
              No.               

83
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,184
Now, your pine trees            
were all chopped down           

84
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,586
to make emergency               
toilet paper                    

85
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:41,920
during the 50-Year Squirts.     

86
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,755
Lucky de seeds have             
been preserved here             

87
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,224
in de vault dere.               

88
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,692
                     What's that
                 splork on them?

89
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,228
     It's not germs, is it?     

90
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,462
        No.                     

91
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,843
Now, that's a tree              
  worth chopping down.          

92
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,911
Indeed!                         

93
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,379
      It's a loverly tree!      

94
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,782
        'Twill truly be

95
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,917

        (tires screech)         

96
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,318
             Arooo!             

97
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,354
          That's what my        
    poll numbers need--         

98
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,724
      happy voters enjoying     
    some holiday cheer.         

99
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:23,395
    As your vice president,     
I order you to steal that tree. 

100
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,329
        (cheering)              

101
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,465
             NIXON:             
     My fellow Earthicans,      

102
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,868
     welcome to the annual      
White House Xmas tree lighting, 

103
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,570
      brought to you by...      

104
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,405
    Gunderson's Nuts!           

105
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:37,676
     (electricity crackles)     

106
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,012
        (cheering)              

107
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,716
 (cracking, creaking, rumbling) 

108
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,685
        (people gasping)        

109
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:47,853
            Oh, no!             

110
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,788
Could the seed have             
been contaminated               

111
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,024
by a virus from                 
the germ vault?                 

112
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,759
            Uh, yeah, I suppose.

113
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,727
        Wait! This could        
        be a good thing.        

114
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,195
     That weaponized virus      

115
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,998
  made the sickly little tree   
      grow big and strong!      

116
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:03,669
      (rumbling continues,      
      pine cones whizzing)      

117
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:07,072
(people gasping, yelling)       

118
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:09,708
    (yells, whimpers)           

119
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,643
        (rumbling stops)        

120
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,512
        (wood crackling)        

121
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,814
      Wait-- this could be      
         a good thing.          

122
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,683
        Reforestation has begun.

123
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,685
        (rumbling)              

124
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,853
    Aw, geez with this, hah?    

125
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,021
      (rumbling continues)      

126
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:26,992
(gasping, panicked shouts)      

127
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,395
                              

128
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:35,233
 (clattering, glass shattering) 

129
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,209
    Arguably, this could be     
         a good thing.          

130
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,179
    The planet has returned     
     to its primeval state!     

131
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,816
Earth is just the way it was    
before the white man came!      

132
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,050
                (device beeping)

133
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,353
                Good news!      
          All these pine trees  

134
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,389
     are fighting global warming
            by producing oxygen!

135
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:58,657
            Happy now, Gore?    

136
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:02,461
        Yeah. But I'd be happier
        if I had a set of lungs.

137
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,463
        (device beeping)        
      Hey, wait a second!       

138
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,432
      Oxygen levels are         
     rising <i>too</i> rapidly!        

139
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,533
         Ten percent...         

140
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,836
         20 percent...          

141
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,705
        60 percent!             
                As long as it   
                 doesn't hit 70.

142
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,340
         80 percent!            

143
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,176
You know, I don't recall        
having done anything            
for a while,                    

144
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:22,080
but I still feel                
I deserve a smoke.              

145
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,049
          Hey, cool.            

146
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,884
     The air's on fire.         

147
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:26,952
         (deep whoosh)          

148
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,354
          (explosions)          

149
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,924
          Ho, ho, ho!           

150
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,726
        Everyone's dead!        

151
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:39,498
  Stay tuned for another tale   
      of holiday hilarity.      

152
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,271
w back to the...                

153
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,342
                Okay, crew, Xmas
                  break is over.

154
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,743
      It's time to destroy      

155
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,678
          these gifts           
     we forgot to deliver.      

156
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,946
Whoa, whoa, whoa!               

157
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,849
      How come we get off       
  for every dumb human holiday  

158
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,718
  but not for robot holidays?!  

159
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,020
    Oh, Lord, not Robanukah.    

160
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,822
    I'm talking about Robanukah!

161
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,992
The holiest six and a half weeks
     in the robot calendar.     

162
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:10,162
Pfft! That's just a fake holiday
     you make up every year     

163
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,663
      to get out of work.       

164
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,366
             Yeah! If it's real,
        how come there's no song

165
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,168
            that explains how   
                to celebrate it?

166
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:17,903
Because there is!               

167
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,038
    Hit it!                     
                Hit what?       

168
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,740
    I placed instruments        
        under your seats.       

169
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,276
Play 'em or I'll break 'em      
        over your heads!        

170
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,044
      (lively intro plays)      

171
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,347
      Robanukah may sound      
      as if it's Jewish        

172
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,216
         But its               
ancient-sounding customs       

173
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,018
  Are exceptionally new-ish   

174
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,954
 So take a hearty swallow      
  from your robo-kiddush cup   

175
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:39,224
 Which will give me time       
to quickly make them up        

176
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,292
                 (belches)      

177
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,993
 Do you spin a dreidel        

178
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,829
       Made from clay?        

179
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:47,299
 Mine is called a "droidl," and
 it's rigged to make you pay   

180
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:51,703
 Do you eat these yummy       
 tin-wrapped chocolate coins?  

181
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:55,607
  Better! We got fembots with  
  illegal five-speed groins!   

182
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,942
                  Shalom,       

183
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,376
Ruth and Esther!                

184
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,579
Why with the music              
        so loud?                

185
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:04,015
Would it kill them to turn up   
     the heat a little in here? 

186
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,652
      But by far the most      
    important thing is oil     

187
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,089
 To keep the lamplight burning 
 or to help the latkes broil?  

188
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,926
 No, we pour the holy lubricant
  out from the sacred vessel   

189
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,063
     Into this blessed pit     
     so they can wrestle       

190
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,900
  The extra made-up touch that 
  makes Robanukah so special   

191
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:25,570
      Is the oil in which      
  the nasty fembots wrestle!   

192
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,707
      We shall now begin        
the traditional oil wrestling.  

193
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:32,744
Will the referee bring out      
the ceremonial cruse            
of petroleum oil?               

194
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,613
             (chittering)       

195
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,314
    Thank you, Abraham.         

196
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:37,883
  Not in the hair, please.      

197
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,218
      I just had it did.        

198
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,087
    (oilcan splutters)          

199
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,889
    (hollow knocking)           
            Aw, no!             

200
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,725
  These broads are supposed to  
wrestle for six and half weeks, 

201
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,860
    but there's only enough     
         petroleum oil          

202
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,595
for four and a half weeks!      

203
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:51,997
        (dramatic sting)        

204
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,431
We're still getting paid, right?

205
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,800
 I told you, it's an audition!  

206
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,203
 Bender, four and a half weeks  
        of oil wrestling        

207
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,404
      sounds like plenty.       

208
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,073
This isn't a lousy              
reformed Robanukah!             

209
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,276
  We need more petroleum oil!   

210
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,478
        (ship whooshing)        

211
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,813
    (quiet, metallic creak)     

212
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,717
  I got me some whale oil,      
    some squirrel oil...        

213
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:13,618
                 Not kosher!    

214
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,253
                 It has to be   
            petroleum oil!      

215
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,655
     Do you not give a damn     

216
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,124
    about the hallowed          
traditions of Robanukah?!       

217
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,492
    I reckon I do not.          

218
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,528
    Anyways, Earth done         
    run out of petroleum oil.   

219
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:24,696
        (all gasp)              

220
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,264
     I tried to warn you.       

221
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:29,301
    One unit of free,           
 limitless solar power, please? 

222
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,870
        (deep whirring)         

223
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,005
        (beeping)               

224
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,373
         That'll be...          

225
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,808
    I don't know, ten bucks?    

226
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,811
    Um, can you make change     
    for a Nobel Prize?          

227
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,582
Aw, man, can't we just          
make more petroleum oil?        

228
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,250
                      I'm afraid
                    not, son.   

229
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,652
            Petroleum only forms
             when organic matter

230
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,721
                 is subjected to
                intense pressure

231
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,990
                 for hundreds of
              millions of years.

232
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,358
         (spluttering)          

233
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,826
    I can't wait that long!     

234
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,094
        I've got A.D.D.!        

235
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,530
This is so unfair!              

236
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,298
                 I don't wrestle
                    dry, Bender.

237
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,900
            I went to Vassar.   

238
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:05,637
Professor, I want you           
to look these poor              
floozies in the eye             

239
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:09,174
and tell them they're           
oil-wrestling days are over.    

240
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,818
 (sighs) Oh... I suppose there  
could be a minute quantity      

241
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:22,587
    of petroleum left,          
 but it would be insanely deep  

242
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,423
 within the Earth, at pressures 
so dangerously high that--      

243
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,058
    (horn honks twice)          

244
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,194
            Let's go already!   

245
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,262
      (clanking, whirring)      

246
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,465
    (engine whooshing)          

247
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,306
        (rumbling)              

248
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,541
    Setting Bachman turners     
         to overdrive.          

249
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,144
We're getting pretty deep.      

250
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,313
            (gasps)             
      Look-- more coffins.      

251
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,849
          (crunching)           

252
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,125
          (clattering)          

253
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,260
          AMY: Oh, no!          
We tunneled into a tunnel.      

254
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:06,698
 What's that loud boring sound  
you'll hear when I stop talking?

255
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,199
    (Professor gasps)           

256
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:11,136
  It's an albino humping worm!  

257
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,505
Why do they                     
call it that?                   

258
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,708
              Because it doesn't
            have any pigment.   

259
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,013
                      What's our
                 depth, Captain?

260
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,848
     40 kilometers... 50...     

261
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,918
         There must be petroleum
        oil down here somewhere.

262
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,353
Go deeper, deeper!              

263
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,821
                     No, Bender.

264
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,923
        The ship can't withstand
             this much pressure.

265
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,726
        Sometimes it falls apart
     just sitting in the hangar.

266
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,696
  Professor, I've never asked   
      for anything before.      

267
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,265
    But seeing those fembots    
      glistening with oil       

268
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,867
        means more to me        
    than life itself.           

269
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,169
                     Oh...      

270
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,704
            Call me an old fool,

271
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:48,506
          but I believe the Lord
        is speaking through you.

272
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,409
             Brace yourselves,  
                 everyone!      

273
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,247
        100 kilometers!         

274
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,782
          Two hundred!          

275
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,451
            I hate to complain  
             about the heat,    

276
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,886
            but the air         
          conditioner's on fire.

277
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,657
        My ice cream manwich!   

278
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,031
            What the hell       
            are we doing?       

279
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,332
         We're all gonna die    

280
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,669
so this junkyard golem          
can celebrate Robanukah!        

281
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,605
        You vile racist.        

282
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,141
    Haven't my people           
        suffered enough?        

283
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,643
Now keep drilling               
for that petroleum oil,         

284
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,145
you selfish cowards!            

285
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,379
Although, then again,           

286
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,415
I guess any kind                
of oil would be just as...      

287
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,649
    (metal crunching,           
    glass shattering)           

288
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:32,817
Not my fault.                   

289
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,489
     I am so great            

290
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:38,723
       Bender is great        

291
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,326
     Bender, Bender,           
        Bender, Ben--          

292
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,961
  Man, where did the time go?   

293
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,329
     Hey, you guys wanna--      

294
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,030
        Oh, right.              

295
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,632
            (gasps)             

296
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,302
They turned                     
into petroleum oil.             

297
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,371
  I thought they were selfish,  

298
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,441
        yet in the end,         
     it turns out it was I      

299
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,543
          who thought           
    they were selfish.          

300
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,248
        (whirring)              

301
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,117
          Hey, ladies.          

302
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,652
         I found some--         
          What the...           

303
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:10,989
                  There was only
                enough petroleum

304
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,124
             for four and a half
         weeks of oil wrestling,

305
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,960
                but it lasted   
              500 million years!

306
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,196
                 It's a miracle!

307
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,865
            BENDER:             
   <i>Happy Robanukah, everyone.</i>   

308
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:25,503
 <i>Coming up next, more thoughtful</i>
      <i>interfaith hilarity.</i>      

309
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,181
        (doorbell rings)        

310
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,749
         (all greeting)         
                      What's up?

311
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,618
LaBarbara, Hermes,              
happy Kwanzaa!                  

312
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,153
We brought                      
a chocolate cake,               

313
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,889
but now I'm worried that might  
be offensive in some way.       

314
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,057
         Just sit down.         

315
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,392
        (doorbell rings)        

316
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,961
                  Happy Kwanzaa,
    brothermen and sistermen!   

317
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,730
          Well, look at the cat 
        the cat dragged in!     

318
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,466
Kwanzaa tradition               
encourages educational gifts.   

319
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,902
So I brought Dwight             
my book on Mathketball.         

320
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,904
                         DWIGHT:
                        Whoa!   

321
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,473
                Let me see that.

322
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,275
I'll sign it                    
for you later.                  

323
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,978
Man, it's a cold                
    one out there.              

324
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,246
         Barbados Slim?         

325
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,814
    Come in, Barbados.          

326
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:10,949
    Look at yourself,           

327
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,885
  all throbbing and shirtless   
        for the holiday.        

328
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,087
      I hope you're ready       
         to celebrate.          

329
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,323
All night long, woman.          

330
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:20,625
        (clinking)              

331
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,026
     I'm glad you all could     

332
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,328
    be here with my family.     

333
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,263
    Kwanzaa traditions          
    are quite ancient,          

334
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,132
          dating back           
    over one thousand years.    

335
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,467
            Whoa.               

336
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,669
        If only someone         
    could tell us more          

337
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,906
         about these traditions.

338
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,507
     Oh, yeah!                  

339
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,942
        Hey, Kool-Aid's here.   

340
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,411
        No, child,              
that's not a made-up character, 

341
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,080
        It's Kwanzaabot!        

342
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:45,016
      And I'm-a tell y'all      
how we celebrate Kwanzaa.       

343
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,851
Zoidberg,                       
lay down a beat.                

344
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,654
                     How 'bout I
                  just lay down?

345
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,457
     (playing upbeat intro)     

346
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:56,294
 There's seven basic principles
  that go to make up Kwanzaa   

347
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,729
 So sit your asses down       

348
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,831
 And have some knowledge       
    dropped upons ya           

349
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,266
         Kujichagulia         

350
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,267
          And Umoja           

351
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,401
         And the rest         

352
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,869
              ALL:              
         Now we get it.         

353
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,138
         Sit back down,        
there's gonna be a test        

354
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,439
     My favorite's Ujamaa     

355
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,141
                     Cooperative
                      economics.

356
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,910
         Yo, Boondocks,        
    I'm talkin' here           

357
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:12,911
     Put away the comics      

358
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,078
        (trilling)              

359
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,413
 Ku'umba is another one       

360
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,015
   It stands for creativity   

361
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,783
                       Like the
          ever-changing nature 

362
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,919
                   Of my sexual
                  proclivities 

363
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,654
   I think there's one called  
             Nia               

364
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,455
  But I don't speak Swahili   

365
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,358
  Something about a pine tree  
 and an oil-wrestling dealie?  

366
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:31,095
 That's from Xmas and Robanukah 
     you plagiarizing lout.     

367
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,864
     Yeah, I'm kinda           
     losing interest here      

368
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,666
 I best be rollin' out        

369
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:38,236
     But before I go,          
the most important thing       

370
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,671
What's that,                    
black Santa?                    

371
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,639
                 You need seven
            Kwanzaa candles    

372
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,074
              That you light up
                every night    

373
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,076
     But they best be          
    made of beeswax            

374
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,245
         Or y'all might        
    as well be white           

375
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,080
              ALL:              
 They must be made of beeswax,  

376
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:52,283
 or we might as well be white.  

377
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,152
Well, we got                    
no beeswax candles,             

378
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:57,855
but these scented regular wax   
candles will do just fine.      

379
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:01,459
Girl, those stank sticks are for
    single women who take baths!

380
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,295
         If your Kwanzaa candles
             ain't 100% beeswax,

381
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,297
                 you bring shame
                 on your people.

382
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,066
Well, now that won't do.        

383
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,734
Husband, show                   
a little ku'umba                

384
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,437
and fetch some beeswax          
before Kwanzaa ends.            

385
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,739
             Sweet candelabra of
            La Habra, LaBarbara!

386
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,841
             Isn't this the last
            night of Kwanzaa?   

387
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,810
      Who the hell knows?       

388
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,178
      (crickets chirping)       

389
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,614
Finally, a bee farm that's      
     open late on Kwanzaa!      

390
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,850
     Madam, I need beeswax.     

391
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,952
    You sure you don't need     
a little honey, handsome?       

392
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,723
 Maybe a taste of sweet nectar  
    straight from the hive?     

393
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,857
         (all gagging)          

394
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:36,227
    I just need some beeswax    
    to make Kwanzaa candles.    

395
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,662
Well, that's too darn bad.      

396
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,231
     There ain't no beeswax     
      in the whole world!       

397
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:43,568
    Oh, no! This could be the   
         year without a Kwanzaa,

398
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:46,504
                 like every year
                    before 1966.

399
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,373
The bees are                    
acting all crazy,               

400
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,175
like they've been drinking      
Tang and cough syrup,           

401
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,378
    or, as I call it,           
        my Friday night.        

402
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:54,779
      (laughing hoarsely)       

403
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,214
        (coughing)              

404
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,582
            My God.             

405
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,550
                     It's colony
              collapse syndrome!

406
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,053
        The bees are swarming   
                 with parasites!

407
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,254
    They're all dying.          

408
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,256
Yeah, but                       
what a way to go.               

409
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,891
Die young,                      
leave a pretty corpse,          

410
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,393
that's what I say.              

411
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,361
         You should say         
        something else.         

412
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,497
Wait-- I know where             
we can get beeswax.             

413
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,866
From those giant space bees     
who nearly killed us,           

414
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,201
and we swore we'd               
never go back there!            

415
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,803
Let's go back there!            

416
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,305
    (engine whooshing)          

417
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,709
         To communicate         
         with the bees,         

418
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,578
         we'll need to use these
            transbumbleators.   

419
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,881
        Bender, say something   
                    in bee talk.

420
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,617
        (buzzing)               

421
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:33,951
    I'm sorry, Bender.          

422
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,953
      What do you want me       
      to put on the glass?      

423
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,188
        (buzzing)               

424
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,891
             Okay.              
         If we survive.         

425
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,267
Something's wrong.              

426
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,935
It's way too quiet.             

427
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,570
     Like the deadly Prius.     

428
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,172
      (buzzing approaches)      

429
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,074
        PROFESSOR:              
      Ah, here they come.       

430
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,375
  They're in attack formation!  

431
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,609
They're going to kill us!       

432
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,649
        That was weird.         

433
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,752
It's like the Jagermeister      
    Air Show all over again.    

434
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,724
According to Google Hive,       

435
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,094
we're at the exact center       
    of the honeycomb.           

436
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,097
 Ooh, and there's a Jamba Juice 
point two miles that way!       

437
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,666
        Does that thing tell you
         where the Queen Bee is?

438
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,969
             The big, fat, ugly,
compound-eyed, hairy-thorax--   

439
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,471
            (grunts)            

440
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,840
          Don't be applying your
          Euro-centric standards

441
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,842
          of beauty to me, fool.

442
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,545
            (gasps)             
 What's with the kamikaz-bees?  

443
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,814
             Man, my hive's been
                 going buck wild

444
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:40,518
    since these blood ganking   
            butt crabs moved in.

445
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,186
      (all groan and gag)       

446
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,155
          Been there.           
        Done that.              

447
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,723
These bees are infected,        

448
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,158
just like                       
the ones on Earth.              

449
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,493
         Brothasuckin' parasites

450
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,628
              gone and disrupted
                our hivemind.   

451
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,463
                  Now instead of
             working in harmony,

452
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,899
            my bees just talk   
            smack to each other.

453
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,135
Are y'all black                 
with yellow stripes,            

454
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,470
or ya yellow                    
with black stripes?             

455
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,772
 Yellow with black stripes, man.

456
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,343
Why don't you                   
just move along?                

457
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,512
    Let me ask you something.   
              You sting my wife?

458
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,080
What kinda buzzin'              
question is that?               

459
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,984
Where do you get the wings      
big enough to ask me that?      

460
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,019
        (buzzing)               

461
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,288
          Okay, gang.           

462
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,723
We have plenty                  
of beeswax.                     

463
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,158
Let's get back                  
to the ship.                    

464
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,160
     No. We are not             
    going anywhere.             

465
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,862
     I can't abide all          
 this bee-on-bee conflict.      

466
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,633
It's time to African-Americanize
        these honeybees!        

467
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,934
        (buzzing)               

468
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,435
        Listen up, bees!        

469
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,238
         It's Kwanzaa,          
        a time of Umoja.        

470
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,973
It means unity.                 

471
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,745
    You have to learn           
    to work together again!     

472
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,047
      The crazy tablecloth man  
             is right.          

473
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,017
        It's time to set aside  
        our differences.        

474
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,519
Black stripe,                   
yellow stripe...                

475
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:49,954
at the end of the day,          

476
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,990
we're just a couple dern        
talkin' space bees.             

477
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,825
                     Hey, forget
                    about it.   

478
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,762
                me here and     
                give me a sting.

479
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:02,133
     Look! The spirit of Kwanzaa
    is killing the parasites.   

480
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,334
         (all cheering)         

481
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,736
      Yech! But yay!            

482
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,505
                Thank you, my   
                  human brother.

483
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,641
        Your message of unity   
          has touched our souls.

484
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:14,712
We are once again               
of a single hivemind.           

485
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,683
(all muttering anxiously)       

486
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,650
(crashing)                      

487
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,952
KWANZAABOT:                     
Oh, yeah.                       

488
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,820
Hooray! Kwanzaabot's            
  here to save--                

489
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,022
(blow thuds)                    
Oh, they killed him.            

490
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,491
        (buzzing)               

491
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,730
Joyous Kwanzaa, everybody.      

492
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:39,837
        (applause)              

493
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,106
                  (chuckling)   
                 Don't worry.   

494
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,542

            be back next year
