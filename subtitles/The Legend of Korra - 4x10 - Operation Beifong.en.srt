1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,900
Earth

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:03,850
Fire

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,500
Air

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,300
Water

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Only the Avatar can master all four elements
...

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,200
And bring balance to the world.

7
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,325
After Kuvira spoon
spiritual vines swamp,

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,200
The Republic City
vine reacted kidnapping people

9
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,625
Korra saved everyone,
but all is not well.

10
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,550
Varrick and Bolin
warned everybody

11
00:00:29,575 --> 00:00:31,275
On the superweapon
of Kuvira.

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,100
Now, Raiko want to ride
a defense against the Empire Earth.

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,375
However Bolin, Opal and Lin are on a mission

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,950
To rescue Su Beifong
and his family,

15
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:39,975
Being held captive
.

16
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,850
BALANCE BOOK 4 CHAPTER 10
"BEIFONG OPERATION"

17
00:00:50,694 --> 00:00:52,574
Let's do this

18
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:55,262
Save the Beifongs
and our love,

19
00:00:55,287 --> 00:00:58,516
Because I promised to repair the space that emerged between us

20
00:00:58,553 --> 00:01:00,295
And turn us into one.

21
00:01:00,938 --> 00:01:02,629
Shut up now.

22
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:05,620
- I got tired of you all the way.
- Yes ma'am.

23
00:01:08,073 --> 00:01:10,660
Kuvira dropped
all vials.

24
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:12,464
Why you do it?

25
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:16,477
Has a battalion of troops
stationed there.

26
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:19,659
We will not see anything useful here.

27
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,697
We have to look more closely.

28
00:01:21,734 --> 00:01:25,287
Do not worry, all prisoners
have been changed.

29
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:29,184
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,900
Grandmother Toph!

31
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:33,655
You'd make me the waist

32
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,561
Last time
met.

33
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,753
My God!
It can not be!

34
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:40,987
Can not be true!

35
00:01:41,037 --> 00:01:43,144
What?
You need to pee?

36
00:01:43,157 --> 00:01:45,656
No.
Now, maybe.

37
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:47,486
It is my hero!
My name Bolin.

38
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,719
Flirt with her granddaughter.
I mean, sort of.

39
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,016
I screwed up,
but that's why I'm here.

40
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:54,447
And it is my hero.
I have said it.

41
00:01:54,497 --> 00:01:55,899
Also won a hug?

42
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:58,535
- What does he have?
- Is an actor.

43
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,109
I've scoured the city
behind the Su?

44
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:02,899
How do you know
she was captured?

45
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:04,626
I'm living in the swamp

46
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:07,528
And watching Zaofu
through the vines.

47
00:02:07,818 --> 00:02:09,408
Of course, it makes sense.

48
00:02:09,446 --> 00:02:11,899
I had already gone when I got here
.

49
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:14,899
I went to town
and I heard that were taken

50
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:17,213
Into a prison camp
around here.

51
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:18,767
Where would that be?

52
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:22,212
There is a factory with
rehabilitation facilities not far from here.

53
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:26,035
- How do you know that?
- The Bolin worked for Kuvira.

54
00:02:26,136 --> 00:02:27,860
How do you just dating

55
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,586
An idiot type
working for Kuvira?

56
00:02:30,623 --> 00:02:32,062
Worked!

57
00:02:32,264 --> 00:02:34,838
There is the sharp tongue,
I can guarantee.

58
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:38,064
Tell me that this attitude
is not hereditary.

59
00:02:41,206 --> 00:02:43,288
Grandma, this is Juicy.

60
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:45,899
And I thought
that Appa was smelly.

61
00:02:45,963 --> 00:02:48,778
Why did you choose
this disgusting thing?

62
00:02:48,904 --> 00:02:51,768
Do not choose our bison,
it is that chooses us.

63
00:02:51,794 --> 00:02:54,645
And after chosen,
you can not go back.

64
00:02:54,683 --> 00:02:56,526
Believe me, already checked.

65
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:01,239
Secure borders,
troops to guard the entrances to the city.

66
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,125
What geniuses thought
to defeat Kuvira?

67
00:03:05,188 --> 00:03:06,899
It is a flying mega-suit.

68
00:03:06,968 --> 00:03:10,077
Asami had the idea to see
dragonfly-hummingbirds.

69
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:12,899
You can wear it and fly
in any direction.

70
00:03:12,954 --> 00:03:14,619
And where is coming out
the spiritual ray?

71
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:16,499
Do not have any.

72
00:03:16,524 --> 00:03:18,430
I'm telling you what I said to Kuvira
,

73
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,899
This technology should not be used.

74
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,455
It is already being used by
Kuvira!

75
00:03:23,505 --> 00:03:26,446
I need weapons of spiritual vines,
and need them now.

76
00:03:26,546 --> 00:03:29,899
There was the Kuvira
harvest in the swamp

77
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:33,495
Gone crazy the vines
and catch all those people.

78
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,767
You should be the bridge between the two worlds
.

79
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:38,540
- Why you can not reap some?
- I will not.

80
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,619
But perhaps because the spirits
enjoy it as much of Republic City

81
00:03:41,682 --> 00:03:44,489
Can convince them to help us
to defend the place.

82
00:03:45,227 --> 00:03:47,688
Perhaps as the Genie of arms

83
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:50,471
And the bridge of spirits
prepare for battle,

84
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,196
Should be to evacuate
ordinary citizens

85
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:56,048
So that if Kuvira attack,
not hurt.

86
00:03:56,616 --> 00:03:59,002
It is a good idea.

87
00:03:59,393 --> 00:04:02,611
Prince Wu, go with the police
coordinate the evacuation.

88
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:05,387
Now all the work.
I want daily reports.

89
00:04:08,718 --> 00:04:11,250
Good job there.
I am proud.

90
00:04:11,275 --> 00:04:12,743
You're starting to sound like a King

91
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:14,745
- For whom I work.
- Thank you.

92
00:04:14,758 --> 00:04:17,275
What if Korra believe that
the "man of the people"

93
00:04:17,313 --> 00:04:19,038
Perhaps even can go out with her.

94
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:22,433
- You always have to spoil everything.
- Come on!

95
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,654
Why do you think that men
do some good things?

96
00:04:24,704 --> 00:04:26,193
To engage girls.

97
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:30,060
Every art, every song, every
evacuation of the city,

98
00:04:30,363 --> 00:04:31,839
All the girls.

99
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:39,134
Okay, guys, let's test
the core of energy.

100
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,822
I want everything ready for the demonstration

101
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,448
For Kuvira tomorrow.

102
00:04:43,486 --> 00:04:45,252
Carry the capsule
energy.

103
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,491
Zhu Li, boot phase one.

104
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:05,063
The condenser is in trouble,
is to regress.

105
00:05:05,656 --> 00:05:07,056
Turns it.

106
00:05:08,457 --> 00:05:10,899
I can not.
The control does not.

107
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:13,899
They need to get out of here,
it will explode!

108
00:05:14,091 --> 00:05:15,870
Everyone, get out!

109
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,602
We will Baatar.
It's too late.

110
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:35,486
This ring was broken.

111
00:05:35,524 --> 00:05:37,808
That's what supercharged
the reaction.

112
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,150
Let's dismantle it all today

113
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,241
And check all parts.
Nothing is too small.

114
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:45,926
This has to be ready
tomorrow.

115
00:05:50,494 --> 00:05:52,900
How long are they not together?

116
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:56,140
For some time now.
A few years.

117
00:05:56,142 --> 00:05:57,686
It's more like 20 years.

118
00:05:57,853 --> 00:06:00,575
Time flies when you're my age.

119
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:03,226
I'm surprised you came to save Su.

120
00:06:03,393 --> 00:06:05,462
I thought not give
well.

121
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:07,838
Su and I finally made peace
.

122
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:11,578
Good, I'm glad we left
everything in the past.

123
00:06:11,745 --> 00:06:13,850
"Leave". It's ok.

124
00:06:16,514 --> 00:06:18,800
Okay, there's the factory.

125
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,476
God,
it is a huge...

126
00:06:35,943 --> 00:06:37,486
Thing.

127
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,764
I think I know where they are.

128
00:06:42,931 --> 00:06:45,724
Do you feel that cave
some rooms below?

129
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:50,794
It seems empty, but is saved by a
horrible robots.

130
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,478
Okay.

131
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:55,530
Why it took
soldiers to defend an empty cave?

132
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:58,295
Should be in some sort of suspended prison
,

133
00:06:58,462 --> 00:07:00,573
So you can not use
the field of earth.

134
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,120
Someone is coming.
Hide yourselves!

135
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,981
I did not expect you until tomorrow
.

136
00:07:16,148 --> 00:07:19,565
Just wanted to make sure
me that all is well.

137
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:23,449
- It looks wonderful.
- We had some breakdowns,

138
00:07:23,516 --> 00:07:26,315
But we must be ready for the test tomorrow.

139
00:07:27,283 --> 00:07:30,368
You worked on it from the beginning, Zhu Li.

140
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:32,212
What do you think
that was the problem?

141
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:34,200
It is a very complex
machine.

142
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:36,570
It is normal to have some bugs to fix
.

143
00:07:36,574 --> 00:07:39,580
But are you doing everything you can
to fix them, right?

144
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,295
Of course, His Eminence.

145
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,293
She is lying.

146
00:07:44,584 --> 00:07:46,490
Warns troops and workers

147
00:07:46,496 --> 00:07:48,472
To come to the demonstration tomorrow.

148
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,625
I want everyone to witness
this incredible new weapon into action.

149
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,270
We should think of a way

150
00:07:57,274 --> 00:07:59,532
To overthrow the Kuvira
as we hypothesis.

151
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,531
Or at least
destroy the cannon.

152
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:04,818
If taken to Republic City,
can destroy everything.

153
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:08,850
I did not come to fight with the Kuvira
or destroy a cannon.

154
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:11,498
I'm here to save my family.

155
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:16,364
It will cost all we have
only to escape alive.

156
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:20,145
The Kuvira want
that all staff

157
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:21,548
See the test
gun tomorrow

158
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:24,701
Then the plant will be
practically empty.

159
00:08:24,868 --> 00:08:26,705
This is our best chance to get

160
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,861
And release the Su
without being seen.

161
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:30,428
Good thinking, Bolin.

162
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:33,355
Thank you.
I got a headache now.

163
00:08:42,135 --> 00:08:43,840
Excuse spirit?

164
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:45,407
Can I speak to...

165
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:47,062
And you disappeared.

166
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,686
Like all other spirits.

167
00:08:52,422 --> 00:08:54,389
Are to leave the city.

168
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,080
Let me ask a question
on the metal domain.

169
00:08:57,082 --> 00:08:59,343
The Su tried to teach me,
but could not.

170
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,667
Had a gym to train the metal domain.

171
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:06,963
Even covered as you can
with the right instruction.

172
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,746
It is even
a sensitive teacher.

173
00:09:09,913 --> 00:09:11,458
I learned to dominate the lava.

174
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,978
Really?
It is a very rare skill.

175
00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:17,778
Maybe even thou some talent.

176
00:09:17,945 --> 00:09:20,738
I do not think they think I'm talented.

177
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,422
It means a lot to me,
to come from my hero.

178
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:25,489
Yes, it is very encouraging
.

179
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:28,301
Hey, I'm blind, I'm not deaf.

180
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,940
So here's something
I always had curiosity.

181
00:09:30,948 --> 00:09:32,795
Who is the father of Lin?

182
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:37,040
It was a type called Kanto.

183
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:40,662
A good man,
but did not go well between us.

184
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,275
E...

185
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:45,842
Okay.

186
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:49,387
Lin, I can feel your breath
angry here.

187
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:52,355
Just say what you have to say
and we will finish this.

188
00:09:52,522 --> 00:09:53,922
Do away with this?

189
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,723
Okay, let's not focus on the fact
that grew up without a father.

190
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,078
You need not be so sentimental
.

191
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:00,720
Just one of those things,
okay?

192
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:03,790
Hey, I forgave thee all thine
blunders

193
00:10:03,793 --> 00:10:07,118
Long,
and Su and I made up.

194
00:10:07,285 --> 00:10:09,265
You're the only
you want to stay

195
00:10:09,268 --> 00:10:13,221
This family drama
meaningless for life.

196
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,650
Forgiven me for what?

197
00:10:14,724 --> 00:10:17,165
And do not know my father
is meaningless to you?

198
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:18,732
It was very important for me.

199
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,465
And so far,
never said anything about it.

200
00:10:21,632 --> 00:10:23,917
You know, after the Su and I
solve our problems,

201
00:10:24,084 --> 00:10:27,105
I thought, "Maybe I should
contact my mother."

202
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:28,933
But now that we're together again,

203
00:10:28,935 --> 00:10:30,707
Remembered why
stop talking to us.

204
00:10:30,874 --> 00:10:33,891
Will you let me furious,
and not even know why.

205
00:10:34,058 --> 00:10:36,099
And when I tell you,
I do not want to know.

206
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:38,945
When we save the Su,
you and I are finished.

207
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:45,509
If that's your decision
and makes you happy, then fine.

208
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,581
The test is about to begin.

209
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:11,770
They'll blow that town
empty that flew yesterday.

210
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,201
Can move forward.

211
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:15,499
Understood.
Come on.

212
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:28,583
The guards are
the other side of that door.

213
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,669
We must be silent.

214
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:34,160
Throw me over the cage,
and I can bring them by my cable.

215
00:11:34,162 --> 00:11:38,020
Bolin, you'll have to catch them
since the mother can not see them.

216
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:40,597
Ready?

217
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:12,004
Let's take them one at a time.

218
00:12:12,171 --> 00:12:13,571
Let's go.

219
00:12:18,282 --> 00:12:19,682
I got you!

220
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,667
Congratulations on all your hard work
.

221
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:31,387
This weapon is proof
that Empire Earth

222
00:12:31,554 --> 00:12:33,539
Is the strongest nation
the world.

223
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:37,520
And believe me,
this is just the beginning!

224
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:40,324
Shoot the gun.

225
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:49,436
- What's going on?
- Probably some minor problem.

226
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,687
I must be able to find the problem.

227
00:12:54,835 --> 00:12:57,033
The pin distributor disappeared.

228
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,051
I swear I left
in place yesterday.

229
00:13:00,218 --> 00:13:02,163
There is no possibility to have fallen.

230
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,771
That may cause trouble
system-wide gun?

231
00:13:04,938 --> 00:13:06,969
Can cause it to explode.

232
00:13:09,386 --> 00:13:10,843
What do you know about it?

233
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,410
Nothing.

234
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,925
Swore me loyalty,

235
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,090
And I gave you a chance
of magnitude.

236
00:13:27,257 --> 00:13:29,854
That's how recompense?

237
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:33,180
You're a monster.
I do not regret anything.

238
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,293
Holds it in the target city.

239
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,930
It will be able to see how the weapon works
personally.

240
00:13:41,097 --> 00:13:42,544
No.

241
00:13:46,161 --> 00:13:47,866
Honey, it's okay.

242
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:50,618
The Lin will not let you fall,
and Bolin will catch you.

243
00:13:50,785 --> 00:13:52,877
No, no.
Just go...

244
00:13:52,989 --> 00:13:54,789
Let me.
I stay here.

245
00:13:57,091 --> 00:13:59,092
Sorry, but I have
to do this.

246
00:14:14,822 --> 00:14:17,188
Prison.
Go already there.

247
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,091
We must postpone the test?

248
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:21,233
I Do not come this far to stop now
.

249
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:22,901
Shoot when you're ready.

250
00:14:22,911 --> 00:14:25,211
I want to see this city destroyed.

251
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:43,591
I'll get them.
We are leaving.

252
00:15:03,091 --> 00:15:05,175
Mother! Dad!

253
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:08,978
Thank you.

254
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:10,791
Let's go.

255
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:13,091
The Kuvira picked up the Zhu Li
and held it in the city.

256
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,374
- What? I have to save her.
- You can not go there, boy.

257
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:18,481
It is suicide.
The Kuvira goes looking for us.

258
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:21,324
We went through a lot together.
I can not leave her.

259
00:15:21,331 --> 00:15:24,706
Toph, said that Zhu Li
lied about fixing the cannon.

260
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,426
She should be trying
stop it.

261
00:15:26,461 --> 00:15:28,391
From what you know, it could just


262
00:15:28,411 --> 00:15:30,911
Be to get away,
to have made a mistake.

263
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:33,393
No.
The Zhu Li makes no mistakes.

264
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,565
Can go. If we survive
arrange way to go to town.

265
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:37,991
No, Bolin!

266
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:46,903
Can go.
I have to go with Bolin.

267
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,550
It might be our best chance of stopping
Kuvira.

268
00:15:52,591 --> 00:15:53,991
And maybe take that gun.

269
00:15:54,011 --> 00:15:55,894
We can not let
Opal be good.

270
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:59,091
If you want to be caught
again, or worse,

271
00:15:59,111 --> 00:16:02,052
This is a problem of yours.
I'm tired.

272
00:16:02,248 --> 00:16:04,489
It takes account of the Baatar and Huan.

273
00:16:07,988 --> 00:16:10,048
And then,
how are you, mother?

274
00:16:10,091 --> 00:16:12,363
I told you never to call me that.

275
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,595
Spirits is the Avatar.

276
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,720
Please listen to me...

277
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:36,583
Since I opened the gates,

278
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:39,091
Spirits and humans lived together happily

279
00:16:39,093 --> 00:16:40,564
In Republic City.

280
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:42,627
That's all
could wait.

281
00:16:42,671 --> 00:16:44,319
I know you felt the effects

282
00:16:44,321 --> 00:16:46,530
The Kuvira to cut
spiritual vines.

283
00:16:46,693 --> 00:16:49,117
But now is not the time
fleeing the city.

284
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,901
It's time to help me
to save her from Kuvira,

285
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,397
Whatever the power of the spirits

286
00:16:53,432 --> 00:16:55,936
For use as a weapon
against other humans.

287
00:16:56,491 --> 00:16:59,330
We are not involved in human
wars.

288
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,448
The spirits helped Unalaq.

289
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:05,354
He used the power of Vaatu
during the Harmonic Convergence

290
00:17:05,413 --> 00:17:07,695
To force the spirits to fight against you.

291
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,931
- Is that what you want?
- No, but as Avatar,

292
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:13,651
Hope will help me,

293
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:15,991
To save the new
world we share.

294
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:19,222
Would you exactly the same as Kuvira.

295
00:17:19,224 --> 00:17:22,451
Use the spirits
as a weapon in a war of humans.

296
00:17:22,715 --> 00:17:24,772
The answer is no.

297
00:17:25,238 --> 00:17:27,577
Wait!
Please listen.

298
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:29,591
If the spirits and human
will live together,

299
00:17:29,623 --> 00:17:31,766
We have to work together.

300
00:17:55,191 --> 00:17:56,610
Opal?

301
00:17:56,621 --> 00:17:59,420
No.
We have to stop the test.

302
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:18,466
Give bad name to
metal rulers!

303
00:20:31,391 --> 00:20:33,240
Thank you for coming to save us, mother.

304
00:20:33,386 --> 00:20:35,114
Yes. Thank you, boss.

305
00:20:35,487 --> 00:20:37,445
I'm sorry for what I said yesterday.

306
00:20:37,465 --> 00:20:40,086
I just... You know
.

307
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:43,465
Look, I know not
was a great mother,

308
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:48,237
But either way,
finished with two great kids.

309
00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:51,831
Good enough to risk
my old ass for you.

310
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,393
If they can find a way
not hate me,

311
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:59,364
May be enough,
at least for me.

312
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:01,758
For me too.

313
00:21:02,491 --> 00:21:05,327
You know, I never had a family
besides my brother

314
00:21:05,362 --> 00:21:06,791
Until a few years ago

315
00:21:06,816 --> 00:21:10,091
And meet with them
made me realize how special...

316
00:21:10,191 --> 00:21:11,923
That's enough.

317
00:21:11,991 --> 00:21:15,554
Enjoy the return to the city
that flying beast.

318
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:18,117
You will not return to Republic City
us, grandmother?

319
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:21,369
No, my days of struggle
over.

320
00:21:21,404 --> 00:21:24,644
Do not say to Korra, the
my back is killing me.

321
00:21:24,691 --> 00:21:26,708
That's why
not come to Katara

322
00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:29,323
To meddle with these things
civil war.

323
00:21:29,358 --> 00:21:33,067
The right time,
we have to leave that to the kids.

324
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,235
I want to thank you for returning
to save me.

325
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,143
And are not hard to Bolin
to work with Kuvira.

326
00:21:39,178 --> 00:21:41,001
His heart was in the right place
.

327
00:21:41,323 --> 00:21:45,026
I think the Bolin managed
away with it is this.

328
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:48,487
Yes...!

329
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:49,891
We should go.

330
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:52,964
I have bad news to bring
to Republic City.

331
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:56,400
The Kuvira will attack
within two weeks.

332
00:22:04,425 --> 00:22:08,425
