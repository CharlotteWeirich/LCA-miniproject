<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:13,496
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:17,575
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:21,888
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:25,048
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:29,210
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:31,050
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:36,989
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,612
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14

Book One: Water
Chapter Nine: The Waterbending Scroll

15
00:01:01,926 --> 00:01:06,838
Would you sit down? If we hit a bump you'll go flying off! What's bugging you anyway?

16
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:08,617
It's what Avatar Roku said.

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,986
I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives.

18
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:12,906
Well, let's see,...

19
00:01:12,976 --> 00:01:16,773
...you've pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you 112 years...

20
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,961
...I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer.

21
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:24,021
I haven't even started waterbending and we're still weeks away from the North Pole!

22
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:25,679
What am I gonna do!?

23
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:28,412
Calm down. It's going to be okay.

24
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:31,675
If you want, I can try and teach you some of the stuff I know.

25
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:33,508
You'd do that?

26
00:01:33,616 --> 00:01:36,682
We'll need to find a good source of water first.

27
00:01:36,771 --> 00:01:41,736
Maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in.

28
00:01:41,823 --> 00:01:44,529
Nice puddle.

29
00:01:53,506 --> 00:01:55,922
Yehhh! Don't start without me, boy!

30
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:57,687
Remember the reason we're here.

31
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,708
Oh right, time to practice waterbending.

32
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,962
Great. So what am I supposed to do?

33
00:02:03,072 --> 00:02:07,114
You could... clean the gunk out of Appa's toes?

34
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,327
So, while you guys are playing in the water,...

35
00:02:09,426 --> 00:02:13,019
...I'm supposed to be hard at work picking the mud out of a giant bison's feet?

36
00:02:13,118 --> 00:02:15,721
Mud and bugs!

37
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:17,763
Okay.

38
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:32,721
Someone's changing our course!

39
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:36,107
What's the meaning of this mutiny? No one told you to change course!

40
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:43,346
Actually, someone did. I assure you it is a matter of utmost importance, Prince Zuko.

41
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,270
Is it something to do with the Avatar?

42
00:02:45,384 --> 00:02:51,747
Even more urgent. It seems... I've lost my lotus tile.

43
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:53,002
Lotus tile?

44
00:02:53,097 --> 00:02:58,278
For my Pai Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant,...

45
00:02:58,383 --> 00:03:03,685
...but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ.

46
00:03:03,798 --> 00:03:06,742
You've changed our course for a stupid lotus tile?

47
00:03:06,835 --> 00:03:10,906
See, you, like most people, underestimate its value.

48
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:14,590
Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call.

49
00:03:14,674 --> 00:03:23,199
Hopefully they'll have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life!

50
00:03:23,297 --> 00:03:29,434
I'm lucky to have such an understanding nephew.

51
00:03:29,637 --> 00:03:34,567
Yeh, don't get too happy. You gotta do me next.

52
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,440
This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to perfect,...

53
00:03:38,534 --> 00:03:42,323
...so don't be frustrated if you don't get it right away.

54
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:45,185
Just push and pull the water like this...

55
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:48,583
The key is getting the wrist movement right.

56
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:51,811
Like this?

57
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:56,394
That's almost right, if you keep practicing, I'm sure eventually...

58
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:58,191
Hey, I'm bending it already!

59
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,177
Wow, I can't believe you got that so quickly.

60
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:03,434
It took me two months to learn that move.

61
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:08,283
Well, you had to figure it out on your own. I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher.

62
00:04:08,369 --> 00:04:09,529
Thanks.

63
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,820
So, what's next?

64
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:17,455
This is a more difficult move. I call it "streaming the water."

65
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:23,706
It's harder than it looks so don't be disappointed if...

66
00:04:31,078 --> 00:04:34,967
Nice work, though the over-the-head flare was unnecessary.

67
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,000
Sorry. Well, don't stop now, keep'em coming!

68
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:42,248
Well, I kinda know this one other move, but it's pretty hard.

69
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:50,974
I haven't even totally figured it out yet. The idea is to create a big, powerful wave...

70
00:04:53,415 --> 00:04:57,179
So, like this?

71
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:02,481
Aang!

72
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:12,105
Looks like I got the hang of that move! What else ya got?

73
00:05:12,217 --> 00:05:14,174
That's enough practicing for today.

74
00:05:14,283 --> 00:05:18,132
Yeh, I'll say! You just practiced our supplies down the river!

75
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:23,035
Uhhh... sorry. I'm sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff.

76
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:28,773
Ugh, it was hard enough when you were just an airbender.

77
00:05:47,252 --> 00:05:51,050
We've got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King Bumi gave us.

78
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:52,438
Let's spend it wisely.

79
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:59,121
Uhh, make that two copper pieces, Sokka. I couldn't say no to this whistle!

80
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:03,863
It doesn't even work.

81
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:07,667
See, even Momo thinks it's a piece of junk.

82
00:06:07,777 --> 00:06:13,673
No offense, Aang, but I'll hold the money from now on.

83
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:19,595
Earth Nation! Fire Nation! Water Nation!

84
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:23,947
So long as bargains are your inclination, you're welcome here!

85
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:27,190
Don't be shy, come one by!

86
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:32,800
Oh! You there! I can see by your clothing that you're world traveling types.

87
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,604
Perhaps I can interest you in some exotic curios?

88
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:40,943
Sure! What are curios?

89
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:45,969
I'm not entirely sure, but we got 'em!

90
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:04,663
I've never seen such a fine specimen of lemur.

91
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:12,376
That beast would fetch me a hefty sum if you'd be, interested in bartering.

92
00:07:12,553 --> 00:07:14,983
Momo's not for sale.

93
00:07:23,383 --> 00:07:29,190
Look at this, Aang! It's a waterbending scroll. Check out these crazy moves!

94
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:32,264
Where did you get a waterbending scroll?

95
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:40,551
Let's just say I got it up north at a most reasonable price. Free!

96
00:07:41,034 --> 00:07:47,065
Waaait a minute "sea-loving traders" with suspiciously acquired merchandise...

97
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:51,776
...and pet reptile birds... You guys are pirates!

98
00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:56,645
We prefer to think of ourselves as high risk traders.

99
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,661
So, how much for the, uh, "traded" scroll?

100
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:03,296
I've already got a buyer, a nobleman in the Earth Kingdom.

101
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:08,821
Unless, of course, you kids have 200 gold pieces on ya right now?

102
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:14,552
I know how to deal with these guys, Katara, pirates love to haggle.

103
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:22,543
Watch and learn. What say to the price of... one copper piece!

104
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:29,244
The price is 200 gold pieces. I don't haggle on items this rare.

105
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,163
Okay... two copper pieces!

106
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,999
It's not as amusing the second time, boy.

107
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,801
Aang, can we get out of here, I feel like we're getting weird looks.

108
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:42,128
Aye, we be castin' off now!

109
00:08:42,227 --> 00:08:43,917
What was that all about, Katara.

110
00:08:44,016 --> 00:08:47,273
Yeh, I was just starting to browse through their boomerang collection.

111
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:50,083
I'll just feel a lot better once we get away from here.

112
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,659
Hey you, get back here!

113
00:08:52,749 --> 00:09:00,928
Well, well, look who's come to their senses. Told ya the haggling would pay off.

114
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:09,026
There they are!

115
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:10,063
Get 'em!

116
00:09:10,142 --> 00:09:13,982
Nobody's goin' nowhere!

117
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:18,436
I... I don't think these pirates are here to trade with us!

118
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,140
Get back here!

119
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:26,743
This way! Let's cut 'em off!

120
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:52,109
My cabbages! This place is worse than Omashu!

121
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:05,898
I hope that lemur of yours has nine lives!

122
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:11,309
Now, who gets to take the steel of my blade first?

123
00:10:11,415 --> 00:10:13,088
No thanks!

124
00:10:16,374 --> 00:10:17,498
Hold on tight!

125
00:10:17,585 --> 00:10:21,231
Aang, I thought we were running away from the pirates!

126
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,859
Just hang on!

127
00:10:30,373 --> 00:10:33,729
I used to kinda look up to pirates, but those guys are terrible.

128
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:37,224
I know, that's why I took... this!

129
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:38,277
No way.

130
00:10:38,368 --> 00:10:39,644
Isn't it great?

131
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:43,740
No wonder they were trying to hack us up. You stole their waterbending scroll.

132
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:48,351
I prefer to think of it as "high-risk trading."

133
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:49,673
Good one, Katara.

134
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:54,510
Sokka, where do you think they got it? They stole it from a waterbender.

135
00:10:54,594 --> 00:10:55,713
It doesn't matter.

136
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,404
You put all of our lives in danger just so you could learn some stupid, fancy splashes!

137
00:11:00,473 --> 00:11:03,187
These are real waterbending forms.

138
00:11:03,264 --> 00:11:07,895
You know how crucial it is for Aang to learn waterbending.

139
00:11:07,978 --> 00:11:09,094
Whatever.

140
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:15,596
Well, what's done is done. We have it. We might as well learn from it.

141
00:11:21,762 --> 00:11:28,551
I've checked all the shops on this pier. Not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace.

142
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:32,136
It's good to know this trip was a complete waste of time for everyone!

143
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:33,969
Quite the contrary.

144
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:39,207
I always say the only thing better than finding something you were looking for,...

145
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:45,515
...is finding something you weren't looking for at a great bargain!

146
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,431
You bought a sumki horn?

147
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,505
For music night on the ship. Now, if we only had some woodwinds.

148
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,842
This place looks promising!

149
00:11:56,939 --> 00:12:02,086
Ooo! That is handsome! Wouldn't it look magnificent in the galley?

150
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:06,244
We lost the Water Tribe girl and the little bald monk she was traveling with.

151
00:12:06,336 --> 00:12:10,918
This monk, did he have an arrow on his head?

152
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,735
I just want to try this one move first and then it's all yours.

153
00:12:13,944 --> 00:12:17,465
Here, hold on and open for me.

154
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:23,853
"The single water whip"... looks doable.

155
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:30,707
What's so funny?

156
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:32,602
I'm sorry, but you deserve that.

157
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:35,640
You've been duped. She's only interested in teaching herself.

158
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:40,852
Aang will get his turn once I figure out the water whip!

159
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,867
Why can't I get this stupid move!

160
00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:48,167
You'll get it.

161
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:52,553
You just gotta shift your weight through the stances...

162
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:54,665
There. See, the key to bending is...

163
00:12:54,751 --> 00:12:56,892
Will you please shut your air hole!

164
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,483
Believe it or not, your infinite wisdom gets a little old sometimes.

165
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:06,445
Why don't we just throw the scroll away since you're so naturally gifted!

166
00:13:06,515 --> 00:13:08,026
What?

167
00:13:10,484 --> 00:13:16,524
Omigosh, Aang, I'm so sorry. I don't know what came over me.

168
00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:21,338
But, you know what, it won't happen again. Here, this is yours.

169
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,804
I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore.

170
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,201
It's okay, Katara.

171
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,939
What about Momo? He's the real victim here.

172
00:13:28,036 --> 00:13:29,371
I'm sorry Momo.

173
00:13:29,486 --> 00:13:31,483
And... what about me? There was that time you...

174
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:35,281
No more apologies!

175
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:46,540
Shouldn't we stop to search the woods?

176
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:50,885
We don't need to stop. They stole a waterbending scroll, right?

177
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:54,878
Then they'll be on the water.

178
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:18,549
Shh! Momo, go back to sleep.

179
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:37,359
Shoot! Come on water, work with me here!

180
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:46,363
Okay, Katara, shift your weight through the stances... ugh!

181
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,711
No, let go of me!

182
00:14:55,586 --> 00:14:59,036
I'll save you from the pirates.

183
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,786
Tell me where he is and I won't hurt you or your brother.

184
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:10,824
Go jump in the river!

185
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:15,229
Try to understand, I need to capture to restore something I've lost.

186
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:21,807
My honor. Perhaps in exchange I can restore something you've lost.

187
00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:25,791
My mother's necklace! How did you get that?

188
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:30,564
I didn't steal it, if that's what you're wondering. Tell me where he is.

189
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,401
No!

190
00:15:31,505 --> 00:15:36,416
Enough of this necklace garbage. You promised the scroll!

191
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:39,945
I wonder how much money this is worth?

192
00:15:40,044 --> 00:15:42,237
A lot, apparently.

193
00:15:42,313 --> 00:15:47,594
Now you help me find what I want, you'll get this back and everyone goes home happy.

194
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,865
Search the woods for the boy and meet back here.

195
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:52,221
Fine.

196
00:15:56,302 --> 00:16:00,731
Huh? Where did she go? I don't believe it.

197
00:16:00,806 --> 00:16:01,731
What's wrong?

198
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:04,526
She took the scroll! She's obsessed with that thing.

199
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,768
It's just a matter of time before she gets us all in deep...

200
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,666
I got him, come on!

201
00:16:22,766 --> 00:16:28,033
Oh, what? I'm not good enough to kidnap?

202
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:32,849
Nice work.

203
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:40,016
Aang, this is all my fault.

204
00:16:40,094 --> 00:16:41,550
No, Katara it isn't.

205
00:16:41,644 --> 00:16:44,246
Yeh, it kind of is.

206
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:45,864
Give me the boy.

207
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:48,406
You give us the scroll.

208
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:52,471
You're really gonna hand over the Avatar for a stupid piece of parchment!?

209
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:55,798
Don't listen to him! He's trying to turn us against each other.

210
00:16:55,901 --> 00:16:58,426
Your friend is the Avatar?

211
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:03,190
Sure is, and I'll bet he'll fetch a lot more on the black market then that fancy scroll.

212
00:17:03,296 --> 00:17:05,942
Shut your mouth, you water tribe peasant!

213
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:09,363
Yeh, Sokka, you really should shut your mouth...

214
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:11,987
I'm just sayin', it's bad business sense.

215
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:15,003
Just imagine how much the Fire Lord would pay for the Avatar.

216
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,518
You guys would be set for life!

217
00:17:17,623 --> 00:17:22,690
Keep the scroll! We can buy a hundred with the reward we will get for the kid.

218
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,712
You'll regret breaking a deal with me!

219
00:17:47,315 --> 00:17:52,101
Thanks, Momo. I owe you a bushel of apples.

220
00:18:31,687 --> 00:18:34,066
Aang, are you there?

221
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:36,319
I'm over here, follow my voice!

222
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,093
Where? I can't find you!

223
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:40,771
I'm right here!

224
00:18:43,886 --> 00:18:47,975
Uhh, never mind! I'll find you!

225
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:50,569
Run!

226
00:18:51,244 --> 00:18:52,962
Katara! You're okay!

227
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:58,063
Help me get this boat back in the water so we can get out of here!

228
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:02,475
We need a team of rhinos to budge this ship.

229
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:07,471
A team of rhinos... or two waterbenders?

230
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,459
Everybody in!

231
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:26,016
Are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail?

232
00:19:26,106 --> 00:19:28,327
We have no time for your proverbs, Uncle!

233
00:19:28,393 --> 00:19:31,203
It's no proverb.

234
00:19:31,268 --> 00:19:34,643
Bleeding hog-monkeys!

235
00:19:39,618 --> 00:19:41,986
Hey! That's my boat!

236
00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:44,392
Maybe it should be a proverb.

237
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,955
Come on, Uncle!

238
00:19:48,672 --> 00:19:51,262
Sokka! Can't you make it go any faster?

239
00:19:51,352 --> 00:19:56,820
I don't know how. This thing wasn't made by the water tribe.

240
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:13,879
Hey, you did the water whip!

241
00:20:13,952 --> 00:20:15,752
I couldn't have done it without your help!

242
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:21,370
Will you two quit congratulating each other and help me out!

243
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:38,378
That's good!

244
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:49,004
Aang, look!

245
00:20:50,575 --> 00:20:53,094
Oh, no!

246
00:21:01,606 --> 00:21:07,180
Have you lost your mind!? This is no time for flute practice!

247
00:21:07,247 --> 00:21:13,312
We can stop the boat! Aang, together, push and pull the water!

248
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:22,428
It's working! It's slowing down!

249
00:21:27,964 --> 00:21:29,427
We're doing it!

250
00:21:29,532 --> 00:21:33,068
But we have another problem!

251
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:57,075
I knew a bison whistle would come in handy. Thanks, Appa.

252
00:21:57,165 --> 00:22:00,324
Yeh, we owe ya one.

253
00:22:02,192 --> 00:22:04,577
My boat!

254
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:13,182
Hehe, Prince Zuko, you're really going to get a kick out of this.

255
00:22:13,282 --> 00:22:19,368
The lotus tile was in my sleeve the whole time!

256
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:29,556
Aang, I still owe you an apology.

257
00:22:29,637 --> 00:22:32,860
You were just so good at waterbending without really trying.

258
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:37,655
I got so competitive that I put us all in danger. I'm sorry.

259
00:22:37,741 --> 00:22:39,296
That's okay, Katara.

260
00:22:39,378 --> 00:22:42,429
Besides, who needs that stupid scroll anyway.

261
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,828
Is that really how you feel?

262
00:22:44,923 --> 00:22:45,878
The scroll!

263
00:22:45,978 --> 00:22:47,893
First, what did you learn?

264
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,004
Stealing is wrong.

265
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,226
Unless it's from pirates!

266
00:22:54,261 --> 00:22:56,341
Good one, Katara.

267
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,068
