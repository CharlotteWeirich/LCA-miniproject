welcome back
to the clippie awards,

4
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,286
honoring the year's most
accomplished delivery boys.

5
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:31,557
Our next category
is best newcomer on a bicycle.

6
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:32,825
Good luck, Dwight.

7
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:33,993
(Bell dings)

00:00:34,028 --> 00:00:35,761
And the nominees are

9
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:39,399
Johnny Jensen from rent-a-cat,

10
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:42,801
Nezzbin Zalgabarg,
ten-minute underwear,

11
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:46,572
and Dwight Conrad, speedy wig.

12
00:00:46,606 --> 00:00:48,408
And the clippie goes to...

13
00:00:48,442 --> 00:00:50,676
(Grunting)

14
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,011
Little Johnny Jensen!

15
00:00:57,518 --> 00:01:00,453
Oh, don't feel bad, son.

16
00:01:00,487 --> 00:01:02,522
We couldn't be
more proud of you.

17
00:01:02,556 --> 00:01:04,623
Unless, of course,
you had won the award.

18
00:01:04,658 --> 00:01:07,460
Man, you're so lucky
to have your family here.

19
00:01:07,494 --> 00:01:10,096
The stupid Professor
didn't even show up for me.

20
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,266
I'd just like to thank
my awesome parents.

21
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,134
We love you, Johnny!

22
00:01:15,169 --> 00:01:16,169
Shh!

23
00:01:16,203 --> 00:01:19,105
Now to get all serious.

24
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:22,341
It's time to pay tribute
to the brave delivery boys

25
00:01:22,376 --> 00:01:24,510
who gave their lives
this past year

26
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:27,346
in the line of duty.

27
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:30,316
Gene Tinker, bus.

28
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,120
Charles Kiley, train.

29
00:01:34,154 --> 00:01:38,157
Mike Pisarik, lion.

30
00:01:38,192 --> 00:01:41,494
They're on the truck
to heaven now.

31
00:01:41,528 --> 00:01:45,030
Up next, the award
for best delivery boy:

32
00:01:45,065 --> 00:01:48,468
Newspaper, phone book,
or miscellaneous.

33
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:51,471
Miscellaneous, that's me.

34
00:01:51,505 --> 00:01:53,072
The nominees are:

35
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:54,507
Gene tinker,

36
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:55,908
Charles kiley,

37
00:01:55,942 --> 00:01:57,176
Mike Pisarik,

38
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:59,812
and Philip J. Fry.

39
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:02,081

40
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:03,916

43
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,491
Sign here.

44
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,496
Wow.
Uh, (Clears throat)

45
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,998
I'd like to thank the academy
of delivery sciences,

46
00:02:19,032 --> 00:02:20,833
my lovely robot, Bender,

47
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:23,836
and most of all, my dear nephew,

48
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,005
Professor Farnsworth.

49
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,108
He always has time for me,

50
00:02:29,143 --> 00:02:30,876
whether it's sending me
on a delivery,

51
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,079
or just pulling me aside
to tell me I'm doing a bad job.

52
00:02:34,114 --> 00:02:35,248
And why?

53
00:02:35,282 --> 00:02:36,749
Because he's family,

54
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:39,051
and family is always there
for each other.

55
00:02:40,587 --> 00:02:42,054
(Groans) I'm sorry,

56
00:02:42,088 --> 00:02:43,756
but I can't keep reading
this tissue of lies.

57
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,191
The truth is,

58
00:02:45,225 --> 00:02:48,394
Professor Farnsworth is a cold,
heartless jerk!

59
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:54,133
And the fish sticks were limp!

60
00:02:58,772 --> 00:03:00,706
Ooh, hefty.

61
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,042
You could really bash
in a skull with this thing.

62
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:04,910
I know, right?

63
00:03:06,746 --> 00:03:08,147
(Clears throat loudly)

64
00:03:08,182 --> 00:03:09,248
What?

65
00:03:09,283 --> 00:03:10,883
Oh, your awards show.

66
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:12,718
I'm sorry I couldn't make it,

67
00:03:12,752 --> 00:03:14,953
but I had a very good reason.

68
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:16,789
Perhaps you'd favor us with it?

69
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:18,157
My pleasure.

70
00:03:18,192 --> 00:03:20,926
You see, I came down
with a searing case

71
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,562
of who gives a crap.

72
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:23,962
(Giggles)

73
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:25,464
(Growling)

74
00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:27,966
Oh, I wish I had
more living relatives.

75
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:29,669
What about
the Professor's parents?

76
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:31,103
They're still alive?

77
00:03:31,137 --> 00:03:33,906
Sure, they exhibit
all the telltale signs...

78
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,642
toenails growing,
hearts pumping fluid,

79
00:03:36,677 --> 00:03:38,411
the whole shmagoigle.

80
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:40,079
So where do these fossils live,

81
00:03:40,113 --> 00:03:42,248
in sedimentary rock?

82
00:03:42,282 --> 00:03:44,817
(Laughing)

83
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:46,419
No.

84
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:48,521
According to
his next of kin file,

85
00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:50,656
they live
in a virtual retirement home

86
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:52,425
on the near-death star.

87
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:53,492
I've been there.

88
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:54,793
Let's boldly go

89
00:03:54,828 --> 00:03:56,895
where we've gone before.

90
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:13,479
Halt!

91
00:04:13,513 --> 00:04:15,114
Visitors are forbidden.

92
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:16,382
Oh, really?

93
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,950
Does that rule apply to...

94
00:04:17,984 --> 00:04:19,151
Clippie winners?

95
00:04:19,185 --> 00:04:20,319
I'm sorry, sir.

96
00:04:20,354 --> 00:04:22,655
Go right in.

97
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:24,990
That's Philip J. Fry.

98
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:28,193
Ned and velma Farnsworth,

99
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:30,363
423 Shadybrook Lane.

100
00:04:30,397 --> 00:04:32,498
Let's hover-roll.

101
00:04:34,735 --> 00:04:38,070
Fry, you're so confident and
take charge on this trip.

102
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:39,672
It's kind of a turn-on.

103
00:04:39,706 --> 00:04:42,107
Not now, Leela,
I'm trying to meet old people.

104
00:04:46,246 --> 00:04:50,549
("Also Sprach Zarathustra"
plays)

105
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:53,185
(Doorbell rings)

106
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:58,157
My God...

107
00:04:58,191 --> 00:05:00,493
It's full of geezers.

108
00:05:09,869 --> 00:05:11,904
Hey, why are they hooked up
like that?

109
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:14,907
Is it some kind of craft-matic
adjustable death bed?

110
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:16,542
(Chuckles) Don't be ridiculous.

111
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:19,378
Their bodies are being used
to generate electricity.

112
00:05:19,413 --> 00:05:22,415
The idea came from an old
movie called <i>the matrix.</i>

113
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:24,350
But-but wouldn't
almost anything

114
00:05:24,384 --> 00:05:26,619
make a better battery
than a human body?

115
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:27,886
Like a potato?

116
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:29,355
Or a battery?

117
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:31,590
Plus, no matter
how much energy they produced,

118
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,226
it would take more energy
than that to keep them alive.

119
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,728
I know, I know.

120
00:05:35,762 --> 00:05:37,363
It sounds absurd.

121
00:05:37,397 --> 00:05:39,432
In fact,
when <i>the matrix</i> first came out,

122
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:42,267
it seemed like
the single crummiest, laziest,

123
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:43,902
most awful, dimwitted idea

124
00:05:43,937 --> 00:05:46,238
in the entire history
of science fiction,

125
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:48,574
but it turned out to be true.
Who knew?

126
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:50,476
Good work, writer
of <i>the matrix.</i>

127
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:54,246
This is it, room 1119.

128
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,081
Aw, it's my relatives.

129
00:05:56,115 --> 00:05:59,552
I'm gonna call them
Gram-Gram and Shabba-doo.

130
00:05:59,586 --> 00:06:01,387
They look just like you, Fry.

131
00:06:01,421 --> 00:06:03,556
Arms, legs, ugly.

132
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,759
Too bad we can't visit them
in their virtual world.

133
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:08,728
We can.
Just moisten your heads

134
00:06:08,762 --> 00:06:11,230
and put on these
real-to-virtual adapter caps.

135
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:18,738
Hmm, electricity plus hats
with wires on them.

136
00:06:18,772 --> 00:06:20,305
Are you sure this is safe?

137
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,576
It's not just safe,
it's 40% safe.

138
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,544
(Electrical crackling,
grunting)

139
00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:38,056
(Yelling)

140
00:06:44,865 --> 00:06:47,199
(Yelling)

141
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:51,404
Told you it was safe.

142
00:06:54,285 --> 00:06:57,988
Wow, so this is my relatives'
virtual old-folks home.

143
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:10,100
There's only one word for it:
Terrible.

144
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:12,436
And also horrible.

145
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,937
This is their room.

146
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:17,073
They're gonna be so
excited to meet me.

147
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:19,510
Hi.

148
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:21,011
I'm your distant relative.

149
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:22,679
Forget it, you flimflammer.

150
00:07:22,713 --> 00:07:25,616
I can smell a scam a mile away.

151
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:29,586
Reverse mortgages.

152
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:32,122
Get your reverse
mortgages here.

153
00:07:32,157 --> 00:07:34,057
Oh, come in, come in.

154
00:07:36,127 --> 00:07:38,695
So, you're really
my grandson, huh?

155
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:40,430
Well, it's not quite
that simple.

156
00:07:40,465 --> 00:07:42,599
See, I got frozen, and your son,

157
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:45,536
Professor Farnsworth, is my
great-great-great-great-great...

158
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,304
Huh?
What?

159
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:50,106
Yep, I'm your grandson
all right.

160
00:07:50,141 --> 00:07:51,542
A grandson?

161
00:07:51,576 --> 00:07:53,310
My, you're a big boy.

162
00:07:53,344 --> 00:07:54,611
What are you, a...

163
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:56,112
A junior in high school?

164
00:07:56,147 --> 00:07:57,481
Most recently, yes.

165
00:07:57,515 --> 00:07:58,982
Oh, you look so thin.

166
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:02,219
Can I offer you some
virtual ham casserole?

167
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:03,987
Sounds delicious.

168
00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:06,290
Mmm.

169
00:08:06,324 --> 00:08:08,124
(Sighs)

170
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:11,195
Nobody's eaten my food
like that in ages.

171
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:14,231
I don't cook much since
we moved out of reality.

172
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,902
(High-pitched droning)

173
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:20,837
(Snoring)

174
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:25,309
And that's how I got this scar
above my eye,

175
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,311
and this fork inside my lung.

176
00:08:27,345 --> 00:08:29,145
(Chuckles) That's a doozy.

177
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,014
Hey, look at this.

178
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:32,849
I can pull my thumb off.

179
00:08:32,883 --> 00:08:35,485
Oh, stop, Shabba-doo,
you're freaking me out.

180
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,521
Don't let him get your nose.

181
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:39,022
(Laughter)

182
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:40,524
(Snorts)

183
00:08:40,558 --> 00:08:41,825
Oh, lord.

184
00:08:41,859 --> 00:08:43,193
(Snoring resumes)

185
00:08:43,228 --> 00:08:45,329
It's so nice
to have more family.

186
00:08:45,363 --> 00:08:46,830
All I had was the Professor,

187
00:08:46,864 --> 00:08:48,865
and he's kind of crotchety
and moldy.

188
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,167
You should have seen
him when he was little.

189
00:08:51,202 --> 00:08:54,170
My golly, he was
crotchety and moldy.

190
00:08:54,205 --> 00:08:56,373
We miss him terribly,

191
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:59,209
but it sure has been nice
spending time with you.

192
00:08:59,244 --> 00:09:01,911
It gets lonely and
depressing around here,

193
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:05,349
with no entertainment
except the rigged bingo!

194
00:09:05,383 --> 00:09:07,351
Old man (Distantly):
Prove it, loser!

195
00:09:07,385 --> 00:09:08,852
Well, we should get going.

196
00:09:08,886 --> 00:09:10,687
It was great to meet you,
though,

197
00:09:10,722 --> 00:09:13,724
and hear about how bursitis
transcends physical existence.

198
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:16,627
(Sniffles)
Keep up with your studies, huh?

199
00:09:16,661 --> 00:09:17,894
What?

200
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:19,529
Oh, God, I'm still here?

201
00:09:21,432 --> 00:09:22,966
I'll miss you guyyyyys...

202
00:09:26,904 --> 00:09:30,106
I don't think Gram-Gram
likes that place,

203
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:32,142
and I know Shabba-don't.

204
00:09:32,176 --> 00:09:34,010
I sure wish
they could come with us.

205
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:39,750
(Alarm sounds)

206
00:09:39,784 --> 00:09:41,785
Guards (Chanting):
Elder abuse! Elder abuse!

207
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:43,420
(Screaming)

208
00:09:43,454 --> 00:09:44,721
Go it! Fastly!

209
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:46,323
(Engine whines)

210
00:09:46,357 --> 00:09:47,991
It won't start.

211
00:09:48,025 --> 00:09:50,093
The batteries are dead.

212
00:09:52,963 --> 00:09:54,798
I'm about to lose
history's greatest life

213
00:09:54,832 --> 00:09:57,601
all because of some
useless old people.

214
00:09:57,635 --> 00:09:59,135
They're not useless.
(Grunts)

215
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,904
They can cook ham casserole...
(Grunts)

216
00:10:00,938 --> 00:10:03,239
And watch TV
at incredible volume...

217
00:10:03,274 --> 00:10:05,241
(Grunts)
And they generate electricity...

218
00:10:05,276 --> 00:10:06,310
(Gasps) That's it!

219
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:07,711
(Grunting)

220
00:10:10,481 --> 00:10:11,715
(Engine starts)

221
00:10:21,992 --> 00:10:23,259
We can cut them off.

222
00:10:23,294 --> 00:10:25,128
Turn left at Miriam Feinberg.

223
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:27,564
I meant Feingold!

224
00:10:39,677 --> 00:10:42,846
It's so nice to meet
the Professor's parents.

225
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,481
I'm Dr. Zoidberg.

226
00:10:44,515 --> 00:10:45,716
I'm very important.

227
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,016
Leela:
Hey, Zoidberg,

228
00:10:47,051 --> 00:10:48,985
you forgot to empty
this trash can.

229
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,355
Don't hit me!

230
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:54,224
I bet the Professor will be
thrilled to see you again.

231
00:10:54,258 --> 00:10:55,726
Oh, Professor.

232
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,127
Some special old people
are here for you.

233
00:10:58,162 --> 00:11:00,530
Are they my zombies
from hammacher schlemmer?

234
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:01,732
(Gasps)

235
00:11:01,766 --> 00:11:03,700
Mama? Daddy?

236
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:06,035
Son!
Hiya, kiddo!

237
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,505
Leave me alone!

238
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:11,875
I never want to see you again!

239
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:14,010
What crawled up his geritol?

240
00:11:14,044 --> 00:11:17,414
Well, to be honest,
a few troubling things

241
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:19,215
did happen in our past.

242
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,151
Lady, all of human history
happened in your past!

243
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:23,754
(Laughs)

244
00:11:23,788 --> 00:11:27,724
Eh, let's not let those
dark days ruin our visit.

245
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,361
Philip, what do you say we go
out today and live it up?

246
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:32,696
Live it up?

247
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,664
I'd be surprised
if you live it out!

248
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:36,533
(Laughs) Whoo!

249
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:38,402
You're on fire!

250
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:40,704
♪

251
00:11:57,588 --> 00:11:59,856
♪

252
00:12:13,638 --> 00:12:15,906
(laughing)

253
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:20,444
Whoa, looks like
you guys had fun.

254
00:12:20,478 --> 00:12:21,912
Did we ever!

255
00:12:21,946 --> 00:12:23,647
Gram-Gram fell down
at the ice cream store

256
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:25,048
and we got free ice cream!

257
00:12:25,082 --> 00:12:26,983
Now let's all go take a nap!

258
00:12:27,017 --> 00:12:28,184
(Whooping)

259
00:12:57,014 --> 00:13:00,750
Professor, Amy and I
are concerned that... oh!

260
00:13:00,785 --> 00:13:03,052
(Sobbing)

261
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:06,857
Aw. What's wrong?

262
00:13:06,891 --> 00:13:10,093
I just want my parents
to love me.

263
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:11,461
God, how I hate them!

264
00:13:11,496 --> 00:13:13,262
Of course they love you!

265
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:14,865
Not like they love Fry!

266
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:16,867
They never
played with me like that.

267
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:18,835
They were always "too tired."

268
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,770
Oh, what awful parents!

269
00:13:20,805 --> 00:13:23,940
Come closer, I'll tell you
the whole story.

270
00:13:23,975 --> 00:13:27,243
Tell you what, let's get an
opaque bubble layer going.

271
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:31,648
Okay, go.

272
00:13:31,682 --> 00:13:36,119
It all started a century
and a half ago.

273
00:13:36,153 --> 00:13:39,489
<i>I had a perfectly normal</i>
<i>adolescence in new New York.</i>

274
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:42,358
<i>But my parents were</i>
<i>simple hedge fund managers</i>

275
00:13:42,393 --> 00:13:45,161
<i>who couldn't appreciate</i>
<i>my interest in science.</i>

276
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:47,964
Mom, dad, look what I made!

277
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:49,365
(Yawns)

278
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,801
That's wonderful, dear.

279
00:13:51,836 --> 00:13:55,705
Here you go, squeakers.

280
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,342
<i>I was accepted to mit</i>
<i>at the age of 14,</i>

281
00:13:59,376 --> 00:14:01,511
<i>but my parents</i>
<i>crushed my dreams</i>

282
00:14:01,546 --> 00:14:03,146
<i>like a discarded frog head!</i>

283
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,715
Honey, I'm afraid
we can't let you go.

284
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,884
You're just not
emotionally mature enough

285
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,385
for college yet.

286
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,254
(Mumbling): "Not mature
enough for college yet!"

287
00:14:11,288 --> 00:14:13,990
(Sobs loudly)

288
00:14:14,025 --> 00:14:16,560
<i>Worried that city life</i>
<i>was filling my head</i>

289
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:18,929
<i>with an unhealthy</i>
<i>respect for education,</i>

290
00:14:18,963 --> 00:14:20,730
<i>my parents moved us to...</i>

291
00:14:20,765 --> 00:14:23,033
<i>A peaceful farm!</i>

292
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:25,101
(Sobbing)

293
00:14:25,135 --> 00:14:26,603
I think that's sweet.

294
00:14:26,637 --> 00:14:27,871
Oh, shut up!

295
00:14:27,905 --> 00:14:30,273
(Cow mooing, chickens clucking)

296
00:14:30,307 --> 00:14:33,176
You're all I have left,
squeakers.

297
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,510
(Bird screeches)

298
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:36,245
(Screaming)

299
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,615
Oh, God, I hated that place!

300
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,116
My parents kept me
there for years!

301
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,851
So when I finally ran away,

302
00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:44,955
I vowed never to
speak to them again!

303
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:48,625
That's a really sad
and long story, Professor.

304
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:50,193
But you'll never get over this

305
00:14:50,227 --> 00:14:51,795
unless you go to
your parents now

306
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:54,030
and tell them honestly
how you feel.

307
00:14:54,065 --> 00:14:55,865
(Sniffs) You're right.

308
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,567
I will.

309
00:14:57,602 --> 00:15:00,971
Oh, I hate you,
I hate you, I hate you!

310
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:02,472
You ruined my life!

311
00:15:02,506 --> 00:15:03,974
Good-bye!

312
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:06,342
(Sobbing)

313
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:13,818
That is one crazy,
uncircumcised old man.

314
00:15:18,254 --> 00:15:19,789
(Door opens, Fry panting)

315
00:15:19,823 --> 00:15:22,558
I almost headed off the
Professor at the east river,

316
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:24,393
but the wind caught
his skin flaps

317
00:15:24,427 --> 00:15:26,696
and sent him parasailing
over the queensboro bridge.

318
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,097
Why would he go to queens?

319
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:29,565
He doesn't need tires.

320
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,434
Our old farm was in queens.

321
00:15:32,469 --> 00:15:35,204
He must've gone back there to
defile it with his nudity!

322
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:36,772
Come on, hurry!

323
00:15:36,807 --> 00:15:38,808
(Groaning painfully)

324
00:15:41,344 --> 00:15:43,813
Why are you so eager to
find the Professor, Fry?

325
00:15:43,847 --> 00:15:45,314
Aren't you mad at him?

326
00:15:45,348 --> 00:15:46,582
Of course I'm mad.

327
00:15:46,617 --> 00:15:47,817
That's been established.

328
00:15:47,851 --> 00:15:49,284
I just want to find him

329
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:50,820
for Gram-Gram and
Shabba-doo's sake.

330
00:15:50,854 --> 00:15:52,154
Who?

331
00:15:52,188 --> 00:15:53,756
Faster, faster!

332
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,991
Okay, stop short!

333
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:57,326
(Grunts)

334
00:15:58,695 --> 00:16:00,262
There's the old place.

335
00:16:01,598 --> 00:16:03,899
Ned:
Hasn't changed a bit.

336
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:05,635
Put on your glasses, sweetie.

337
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:07,503
(Screams)

338
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:11,140
(Hooting)

339
00:16:11,174 --> 00:16:12,775
(Professor whimpering, sobbing)

340
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:14,010
(Gasps)

341
00:16:14,044 --> 00:16:15,277
I hear something!

342
00:16:19,816 --> 00:16:21,017
(Fry gasps)

343
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:22,451
It's the Professor!

344
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:25,821
Yes, everyone look at the freak!

345
00:16:25,856 --> 00:16:28,924
His parents didn't love him,
so they kept him here,

346
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,327
a hundred Miles
from the nearest microscope!

347
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:33,963
Why?

348
00:16:33,997 --> 00:16:35,364
Why?!

349
00:16:35,398 --> 00:16:36,766
Oh...

350
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,267
He deserves the truth, velma.

351
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,102
I think he's old enough
to handle it.

352
00:16:40,137 --> 00:16:41,603
Cupcake...

353
00:16:41,638 --> 00:16:43,673
We never told you this, but...

354
00:16:43,707 --> 00:16:46,008
You had an older brother.

355
00:16:46,043 --> 00:16:48,477
Wha...?

356
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:52,648
Velma:
<i>In many ways, he was like you.</i>

357
00:16:52,683 --> 00:16:56,552
<i>He loved science and was</i>
<i>desperate to go to college.</i>

358
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:58,387
<i>He even looked</i>
<i>a little like you.</i>

359
00:17:00,724 --> 00:17:02,825
But the sad fact was...

360
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:06,028
Oh, how can I
put this delicately?

361
00:17:06,063 --> 00:17:07,830
He was a crazy-ass nutjob!

362
00:17:07,864 --> 00:17:09,231
Thank you, ned.

363
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:10,833
But so what?

364
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:14,670
He was our crazy-ass nutjob,
and we loved him.

365
00:17:14,705 --> 00:17:17,073
(Screams, groans)

366
00:17:17,107 --> 00:17:20,342
Velma: <i>Every night, the poor
boy had terrors in his sleep.</i>

367
00:17:20,376 --> 00:17:23,079
<i>His pajamas would be</i>
<i>soaked with sweat.</i>

368
00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:25,547
Yeah, sweat. Right.

369
00:17:25,582 --> 00:17:28,417
Velma: <i>We'd stay at his
bedside all night,</i>

370
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:31,987
<i>and whenever he'd start moaning</i>
<i>and sweating his pants,</i>

371
00:17:32,022 --> 00:17:34,890
<i>we'd read to him</i>
<i>from his favorite book.</i>

372
00:17:34,925 --> 00:17:37,426
81, thallium.

373
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,394
82, lead.

374
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:41,831
82, bismuth.

375
00:17:41,865 --> 00:17:44,767
Ned: <i>The poor little psycho never
could've survived on his own.</i>

376
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:47,603
<i>So we kept him on</i>
<i>the farm as long as we could.</i>

377
00:17:47,637 --> 00:17:50,906
Velma:
<i>But one night he ran away,</i>

378
00:17:50,941 --> 00:17:53,109
<i>taking nothing but</i>
<i>the clothes on his back.</i>

379
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:56,178
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

380
00:17:56,213 --> 00:17:58,513
(Screaming)

381
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:06,455
Velma: <i>He was admitted to a
prestigious institution...</i>

382
00:18:06,489 --> 00:18:08,924
<i>a mental institution!</i>

383
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:11,393
Ned: <i>Got himself a full
wackademic scholarship.</i>

384
00:18:11,427 --> 00:18:14,864
<i>And we never saw him again!</i>

385
00:18:14,898 --> 00:18:17,867
We couldn't let you end up
like your older brother.

386
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:21,303
That's why we kept you
on the farm and helped you get

387
00:18:21,337 --> 00:18:24,039
your online doctorate
in rodeo studies.

388
00:18:24,074 --> 00:18:26,075
Rodeo studies?

389
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:28,744
We did it out of
love for you, Floyd.

390
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:31,313
Floyd? Who the hell's Floyd?

391
00:18:31,347 --> 00:18:32,714
I'm Hubert!

392
00:18:32,749 --> 00:18:34,049
You're Hubert?

393
00:18:34,084 --> 00:18:35,785
The older brother?

394
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:37,119
(Gasping)

395
00:18:37,154 --> 00:18:38,553
But... we thought

396
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:40,389
you were still in
an institution!

397
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:41,757
Oh, no, no, no, no.

398
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:44,093
I was out within 25 years.

399
00:18:44,127 --> 00:18:47,296
It felt like a minute
compared to grad school.

400
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,465
Oh, hubie, we're so happy
to see you again!

401
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,733
Wait.

402
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:53,235
Was all that true?

403
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,637
Did you really sit up
with me every night?

404
00:18:55,672 --> 00:18:57,273
You bet, sport.

405
00:18:57,307 --> 00:19:00,309
That's why we were always
too tired to play with you.

406
00:19:00,343 --> 00:19:02,611
I'm so sorry we never
got the chance.

407
00:19:04,714 --> 00:19:06,615
Oh, mama!

408
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:08,117
Daddy!

409
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:10,452
(Sobbing)

410
00:19:11,554 --> 00:19:12,855
(Clears throat)

411
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:15,291
Uh, this may not
be the best time,

412
00:19:15,325 --> 00:19:18,493
but a couple years ago,
a homeless rodeo clown

413
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:20,329
named Floyd came to
the door claiming he was...

414
00:19:20,363 --> 00:19:21,997
Bender!

415
00:19:22,032 --> 00:19:25,134
Why do you always have
to be the center of attention?

416
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,343
You're sure you want to go back
to the near-death star?

417
00:19:34,377 --> 00:19:36,178
Oh, my, yes.

418
00:19:36,213 --> 00:19:38,814
Our muscles are sore,
our bones ache.

419
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:40,549
My damn skin even hurts.

420
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,017
It's no dream house,

421
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:44,220
but we get fed
through our spines

422
00:19:44,254 --> 00:19:46,288
and the rent is reasonable.

423
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:50,226
Don't worry.

424
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,294
I'll come back
and visit sometime.

425
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:53,863
How about December,

426
00:19:53,897 --> 00:19:56,631
when they inject the holidays
into our brains?

427
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,734
That sounds nice, Gram-Gram.

428
00:19:58,768 --> 00:20:00,202
Well, son,

429
00:20:00,237 --> 00:20:02,238
I guess this is
good-bye again.

430
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:03,705
Not quite yet.

431
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,574
I took the liberty
of reprogramming

432
00:20:05,608 --> 00:20:07,176
your retirement simulation.

433
00:20:08,778 --> 00:20:10,512
Why don't I come in
for a moment

434
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:11,847
and show you around?

435
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:23,058
Good virtual God!

436
00:20:23,093 --> 00:20:24,760
It's our old farm!

437
00:20:24,794 --> 00:20:26,762
It's beautiful!

438
00:20:26,796 --> 00:20:30,766
Appearances... just a simple
matter of appearances.

439
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,501
Speaking of which...

440
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:35,304
(Gasps)

441
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:38,673
Velma:
My boy!

442
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,910
My beautiful boy!

443
00:20:40,944 --> 00:20:43,012
One last chance to play...

444
00:20:43,046 --> 00:20:44,780
if you're not too tired?

445
00:20:44,814 --> 00:20:47,749
Not too tired to chase you,
you cute little nutjob!

446
00:20:47,784 --> 00:20:49,551
Come on, velma!

447
00:20:49,585 --> 00:20:51,053
Someone needs tickles!
I'm gonna get you!

448
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:52,888
Here I come!
(Laughing)

449
00:20:52,923 --> 00:20:55,291
I almost got you!
Come here, you.

450
