1
00:00:07,493 --> 00:00:09,484  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:495 Y2:516
A Leela of Her Own

2
00:00:33,373 --> 00:00:35,284  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:061 Y2:082
Put down the binoculars.

3
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,849  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:061 Y2:127
The wall of that strip club isn't gonna
collapse twice in one day.

4
00:00:39,053 --> 00:00:44,173  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:061 Y2:127
I know. I accept that. Now I'm
interested in that new pizza parlor.

5
00:00:44,373 --> 00:00:48,571  X1:093 X2:626 Y1:061 Y2:126
Makes me pine for my days as a delivery
boy. "Here's your pizza," I'd say.

6
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:52,089  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:061 Y2:127
"I didn't order any," they'd say.
Then off to my next adventure.

7
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:56,451  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:456 Y2:516
That story stunk.
Hand me the binoculars.

8
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:04,083  X1:155 X2:559 Y1:490 Y2:516
The owner is from Signas-Five.

9
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:09,248  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:061 Y2:126
Signoids? On our block? They should go
back where they came from.

10
00:01:09,493 --> 00:01:12,132  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:061 Y2:088
Society's never gonna make progress...

11
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:15,450  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:061 Y2:121
...until we learn to pretend
to like each other.

12
00:01:15,653 --> 00:01:18,725  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:061 Y2:122
Let's make these hideous strangers
feel welcome.

13
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:19,962  X1:337 X2:379 Y1:495 Y2:516
No.

14
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:25,446  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:061 Y2:126
You sure about these chairs? Guidebook
says human legs bend down at knee.

15
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:27,245  X1:249 X2:466 Y1:061 Y2:088
It's okay, Mama.

16
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:33,289  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:061 Y2:126
Anyone complains,
I bend legs up for free. Customers.

17
00:01:35,613 --> 00:01:40,641  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:061 Y2:126
Welcome to Earth Pizza Store.
Here, sit. I bend the knees for you.

18
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,451  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:489 Y2:516
That's comfy.

19
00:01:46,653 --> 00:01:50,043  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:490 Y2:516
What kind of pizza goes in you?

20
00:01:50,293 --> 00:01:55,287  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:451 Y2:516
Silt? Asbestos?
We got guano, very fresh.

21
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:56,852  X1:258 X2:459 Y1:490 Y2:516
Have any food?

22
00:01:57,093 --> 00:02:02,690  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:451 Y2:516
Here, try a deep-dish pizza.
Contains four kinds of things.

23
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:13,882  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:451 Y2:516
- This tastes like vomit.
- Thank you.

24
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:17,648  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:456 Y2:516
Actually, I mean to offend a little.
This is awful.

25
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,485  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:516
What's wrong?
Was it something Leela said?

26
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:36,126  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:451 Y2:516
We come to Earth to start new life,
raise fat, spoiled Earth kids...

27
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:41,453  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:454 Y2:516
...hang many underwear from Earth
clothesline, live Earthican dream.

28
00:02:43,693 --> 00:02:47,129  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:450 Y2:516
Don't cry, foreign people.
I used to work in a pizzeria.

29
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:49,887  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:490 Y2:516
As soon as I stop blasting puke...

30
00:02:50,093 --> 00:02:56,043  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:450 Y2:516
...I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza.
- Thank you, magic biped.

31
00:02:57,133 --> 00:03:02,253  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:454 Y2:516
You save us, sir. If we cannot make
Earth Pizza, our dream will die.

32
00:03:02,493 --> 00:03:07,044  X1:193 X2:521 Y1:456 Y2:516
Just like rats we crushed
to make the wine.

33
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:19,086  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:451 Y2:516
For starters, use quality ingredients.
Case in point? No more live bees.

34
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:23,847  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:451 Y2:516
When you put pizzas in the oven,
don't get in with them.

35
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:25,884  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hey, <i>ocupado.</i>

36
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:30,092  X1:222 X2:493 Y1:451 Y2:516
Most important of all
is the big-screen TV.

37
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:34,849  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:455 Y2:516
Families need a TV so they don't
have to talk to each other.

38
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:37,965  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:490 Y2:516
The Earthican pastime. Blernsball.

39
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:45,048  X1:126 X2:585 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Mulligan drives the ball. It's going,</i>
<i>going and caught by the shortstop.</i>

40
00:03:45,253 --> 00:03:50,885  X1:106 X2:608 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Mets lose again. I haven 't seen play</i>
<i>this bad since the days of Bob Uecker.</i>

41
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:53,647  X1:176 X2:537 Y1:061 Y2:126
<i>This is Bob Uecker</i>
<i>saying thanks for watching.</i>

42
00:03:53,893 --> 00:04:00,128  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:456 Y2:516
Mets? Shortstop? Pinching the hitter?
I don't understand this Blernsball.

43
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:05,652  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:450 Y2:516
We'll teach you. Your pizzeria will
play a game against Planet Express.

44
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:09,044  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:516
- But you'll need nine players.
- No problem.

45
00:04:14,893 --> 00:04:17,202  X1:275 X2:441 Y1:490 Y2:516
Play the ball.

46
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:36,044  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:490 Y2:516
Go, team. Beat those no-good Signoids.

47
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:39,643  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:451 Y2:516
Show them they stink in a game
they've never played.

48
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,643  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:490 Y2:516
This is why I love Earth.

49
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:51,881  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:451 Y2:516
Beautiful star-brightened day, friendly
Blernsball game with chum pals.

50
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:53,964  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:490 Y2:516
So pleasant for everybody.

51
00:04:56,453 --> 00:04:59,172  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hit by a pitch. Take your base.

52
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:04,646  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:451 Y2:516
Sorry about that. I guess I needed
a few more warm-up pitches.

53
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,129  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:493 Y2:516
No batter, no batter.

54
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,722  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:451 Y2:516
- No batter anymore.
- Take your base.

55
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:17,091  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:516
I didn't mean to hit you.
I have trouble with depth perception.

56
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,563  X1:228 X2:486 Y1:493 Y2:516
Yeah. Me too, now.

57
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:25,084  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:451 Y2:516
Hey, batter, batter, batter, batter.
Hey, duck.

58
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,244  X1:254 X2:461 Y1:490 Y2:516
Take your base.

59
00:05:29,253 --> 00:05:30,845  X1:217 X2:498 Y1:493 Y2:516
Please, I want to live.

60
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:34,449  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Can I use bat to protect head?
- Apparently not.

61
00:05:36,413 --> 00:05:38,643  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:490 Y2:516
Check out the one-eyed bean machine.

62
00:05:41,493 --> 00:05:44,166  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hooray, I make a score point.

63
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,692  X1:222 X2:493 Y1:451 Y2:516
You beaned a run in.
Better let me pitch.

64
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:53,326  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:450 Y2:516
But I've got a no-hitter going.
You're right. Here.

65
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:58,926  X1:231 X2:484 Y1:455 Y2:516
Don't take her out.
She's a firecracker.

66
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:03,050  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:455 Y2:516
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Am I under arrest?

67
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:08,287  X1:124 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:516
You're the sleaze bag who owns
the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.

68
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:11,923  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:455 Y2:516
Now I'm the sleaze bag who owns
the New New York Mets.

69
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:14,641  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:456 Y2:516
The Mets?
Those bums are worse than me.

70
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:19,643  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:450 Y2:516
But they don't draw a crowd like you.
Which is why I want to sign you.

71
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:25,047  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:516
You mean, I'd be the first woman ever
to play major league blernsball?

72
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:27,124  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:489 Y2:516
lt'd be a publicity stunt.

73
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,848  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:456 Y2:516
A one-eyed lady might bring out
the freak show crowd.

74
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:35,371  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:451 Y2:516
Wow, the first woman ever to play
major league blernsball.

75
00:06:35,613 --> 00:06:38,889  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Again, yeah. But you'd just be...
- Yippee!

76
00:06:45,213 --> 00:06:50,526  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:451 Y2:516
The first woman ever to play major
league blernsball. How do I look?

77
00:06:50,773 --> 00:06:54,846  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Like a sexy Yogi Berra.
- Why is your number 7 /8?

78
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:57,009  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:495 Y2:516
The whole numbers have been retired.

79
00:06:57,213 --> 00:07:00,410  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:450 Y2:516
I'm impressed.
You look just like a ball player.

80
00:07:00,613 --> 00:07:03,685  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Can I pat you on the butt?
- I'm a professional athlete.

81
00:07:03,893 --> 00:07:06,043  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:490 Y2:516
So go ahead.

82
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:07,931  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:494 Y2:516
Now I'm too nervous.

83
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:23,284  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:456 Y2:516
The Swedes have already
turned this one into a "laffer".

84
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:28,004  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:061 Y2:127
And that's with two "F's."
The crowd is pouring out L.A. -style.

85
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:34,562  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:516
Skipper, we're losing the crowd.
Put in our new novelty act, Leela.

86
00:07:34,813 --> 00:07:37,532  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:490 Y2:516
I already put in the circus clown.

87
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:41,448  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:451 Y2:516
But he bunted. Clowns are only funny
when they swing away.

88
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:47,364  X1:127 X2:593 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Your attention please. Now pitching</i>
<i>for the Mets, Turanga Leela.</i>

89
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:51,247  X1:226 X2:486 Y1:490 Y2:516
<i>A one-eyed woman.</i>

90
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:54,769  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:490 Y2:516
Come on, throw like a girl.

91
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:58,767  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Go, Leela.
- Too much eyeliner.

92
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:01,368  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:490 Y2:516
This is history in the making.

93
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:05,122  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:456 Y2:516
Bjornson steps up to the plate,
and Leela delivers.

94
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:08,730  X1:291 X2:424 Y1:489 Y2:516
Bull's-eye.

95
00:08:08,973 --> 00:08:13,967  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:456 Y2:516
An inauspicious start for the career
of the first woman blernsballer.

96
00:08:16,493 --> 00:08:21,613  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:456 Y2:516
An inauspicious continuation for the
career of the first woman blernsballer.

97
00:08:32,373 --> 00:08:35,968  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:495 Y2:516
Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean...

98
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:46,762  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:061 Y2:127
It's a three-bean, ball salad.
The Mets fans love it, though.

99
00:08:47,013 --> 00:08:50,926  X1:197 X2:517 Y1:061 Y2:127
They haven't had much
to cheer about this year.

100
00:08:55,813 --> 00:09:00,489  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:451 Y2:516
That was great. You got more publicity
than a cowboy in a shark tank.

101
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,928  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:490 Y2:516
Poor Tex. He was quite a shark.

102
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:09,968  X1:292 X2:424 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Hey!
- Come on!

103
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:13,330  X1:315 X2:401 Y1:451 Y2:516
- I win.
- Sorry.

104
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:19,369  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:451 Y2:516
- How did you get in here?
- As your agent, I have access.

105
00:09:19,613 --> 00:09:22,923  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Since when are you my agent?
- Quiet! Call coming in.

106
00:09:23,173 --> 00:09:27,963  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:456 Y2:516
Yes? A big endorsement deal
for Leela? How much?

107
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:33,048  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:451 Y2:516
You put a one and two zeros
in front of that, or we pass. Deal.

108
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:37,644  X1:087 X2:631 Y1:455 Y2:516
- That's great. How much did you get me?
- One hundred dollars!

109
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:44,527  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:451 Y2:516
As a pitcher,
I serve up plenty of bean balls.

110
00:09:44,773 --> 00:09:47,685  X1:094 X2:620 Y1:490 Y2:516
So I know good beans when I see them.

111
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:53,485  X1:102 X2:613 Y1:455 Y2:516
- Bean-Bay Beans! They're the beaniest!
- Cut!

112
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:57,451  X1:240 X2:476 Y1:495 Y2:516
Bean! Bean! Bean!

113
00:09:57,693 --> 00:10:00,890  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:061 Y2:121
In short order,
Leela has become a fan favorite.

114
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,481  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:489 Y2:516
You're the best, babe. Hang on.

115
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:20,853  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:451 Y2:516
You put a one and two zeros
in front of that, or we pass. Deal.

116
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:24,688  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:451 Y2:516
- So, what did you get me?
- A thousand and one pesos.

117
00:10:37,493 --> 00:10:41,122  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:495 Y2:516
Cut. Now do one with the bean suit on.

118
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:48,769  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:490 Y2:516
Leela bringing in customers.

119
00:10:49,013 --> 00:10:52,244  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:456 Y2:516
This keep up, we need to buy
second sauce toilet.

120
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:57,732  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:451 Y2:516
I want to injure men by throwing stuff
at them, just like you. Will you sign?

121
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:03,044  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:456 Y2:516
Sure thing, sweetie.
Who should I make it out to?

122
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:04,522  X1:299 X2:418 Y1:490 Y2:516
To eBay?

123
00:11:04,773 --> 00:11:08,846  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's a popular name today.
Little "E," big "B"?

124
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:19,169  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:451 Y2:516
Five bucks an autograph, 200 fans, add
a one and two zeros, we got a wad.

125
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:24,362  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:455 Y2:516
I'm doing it for all the female
athletes who need a role model.

126
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:28,845  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:451 Y2:516
- A role model for how to stink.
- What? Who are you?

127
00:11:29,093 --> 00:11:32,529  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:456 Y2:516
Jackie Anderson.
I'm on the team at NNYU.

128
00:11:32,773 --> 00:11:35,162  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:490 Y2:516
I was hoping to play in the majors.

129
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:37,329  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:490 Y2:516
Following in my footsteps.

130
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:41,043  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:451 Y2:516
God forbid! Your freak show
is making it impossible...

131
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:44,086  X1:217 X2:497 Y1:451 Y2:516
...for female players
to be taken seriously.

132
00:11:44,293 --> 00:11:47,808  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:489 Y2:516
I hope you're proud of yourself.

133
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:59,567  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:455 Y2:516
Show's over, no refunds.
You heard the robot. Get out!

134
00:12:02,693 --> 00:12:07,448  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:450 Y2:516
Fans haven't been cheering for me.
They've been cheering at me.

135
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:12,363  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:516
Don't be upset, Leela.
You look really cute in your uniform.

136
00:12:12,573 --> 00:12:17,727  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's what makes it so sad!
I thought I was doing something heroic!

137
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:22,961  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:451 Y2:516
You are! What about that little girl
you visited in the hospital who died?

138
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:26,483  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:450 Y2:516
You're right.
I can't let people down anymore.

139
00:12:26,693 --> 00:12:31,767  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:450 Y2:516
God's my witness, I vow to earn the
respect of girls and women everywhere!

140
00:12:31,973 --> 00:12:36,125  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:451 Y2:516
I will become the best
blernsball player of all time!

141
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:41,851  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's statistically impossible. In 77
innings, you haven't gotten one out.

142
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,841  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:450 Y2:516
At this rate, you'll be the worst
player of all time.

143
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:49,846  X1:200 X2:514 Y1:451 Y2:516
Then I have a new vow.
I solemnly swear...

144
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:55,252  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:451 Y2:516
...I will become not the worst
blernsball player of all time!

145
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:17,252  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:456 Y2:516
Look! The players who broke
the various color barriers!

146
00:13:17,453 --> 00:13:22,527  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:451 Y2:516
When will man learn that all races
are equally inferior to robots?

147
00:13:24,653 --> 00:13:30,091  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:451 Y2:516
If I could be just a little better
than him, I can hold my head high.

148
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:34,326  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
He once struck out when his tongue
got stuck to a cold bat.

149
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:38,685  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:451 Y2:516
- He tried to catch with an oven mitt!
- It's a crummy hologram.

150
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:42,329  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:455 Y2:516
I'm not a hologram.
Hank Aaron the 24th.

151
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:47,089  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:451 Y2:516
How could you play so badly?
The original Hank Aaron was great!

152
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,931  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:490 Y2:516
I was better than great.

153
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,688  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:061 Y2:121
- I was the home run king.
- Neat!

154
00:13:52,893 --> 00:13:56,329  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:451 Y2:516
So, Hank, the bad Hank,
just how bad were you?

155
00:13:56,573 --> 00:13:58,484  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:490 Y2:516
My batting average was low.

156
00:13:58,693 --> 00:14:03,483  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:451 Y2:516
Low? It was zero! You went your
whole career without getting a hit.

157
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:07,652  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:061 Y2:126
Leela beats that. She pitched
without ever getting an out!

158
00:14:07,893 --> 00:14:12,045  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:061 Y2:126
You stink! Junior, she belongs
in the exhibit instead of you!

159
00:14:12,253 --> 00:14:15,165  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:061 Y2:126
Forget it!
This job's too cushy to give up.

160
00:14:17,053 --> 00:14:22,002  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:456 Y2:516
- Wade Boggs, goes down smooth.
- I don't want to be in this exhibit.

161
00:14:22,213 --> 00:14:26,809  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:451 Y2:516
I need your help, so I can be one tiny
iota less pathetic than you.

162
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:30,801  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:516
I can't help you play better
than Tiny lota. He was great!

163
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:33,208  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:489 Y2:516
But I'll teach you all I know.

164
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:40,652  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Okay, let's see what you can do.
- She can lodge a ball in your brain.

165
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:43,447  X1:149 X2:565 Y1:490 Y2:516
You better get a batting helmet.

166
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:48,844  X1:201 X2:513 Y1:490 Y2:516
All right, low and away.

167
00:14:55,653 --> 00:15:00,090  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:451 Y2:516
Okay, try it again. But this time,
keep your eye off the ball.

168
00:15:00,293 --> 00:15:02,045  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:495 Y2:516
You mean on the ball?

169
00:15:02,253 --> 00:15:06,883  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:516
- Who's in the hall of fame?
- You're holding the bat upside down.

170
00:15:07,093 --> 00:15:11,848  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Just pitch the ball!
- Okay, eye off the ball.

171
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:17,205  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Strike!
- Man, you did it, Leela!

172
00:15:17,413 --> 00:15:22,089  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:516
I didn't hit the batter! I was pitching
and not just belly-itching!

173
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:26,531  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:451 Y2:516
Oh, you got that too?
I think there's a rash going around.

174
00:15:35,013 --> 00:15:41,327  X1:092 X2:624 Y1:061 Y2:126
Welcome to Fenway where the Mets end
a season that ranks among the worst.

175
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,604  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:490 Y2:516
You opened a franchise!

176
00:15:45,813 --> 00:15:49,249  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:456 Y2:516
Yes. Our biggest seller
is Leela's Bean Pizza!

177
00:15:49,453 --> 00:15:53,048  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:451 Y2:516
Six kinds of beans
plus things that look like beans.

178
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:54,845  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:493 Y2:516
Beans, huh?

179
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:59,651  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:451 Y2:516
This is great!
How do you make the crust so fizzy?

180
00:15:59,853 --> 00:16:01,844  X1:206 X2:508 Y1:490 Y2:516
Ancient Signoid secret.

181
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:06,450  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:451 Y2:516
My husband, some hotshot.
Here's his ancient Signoid secret.

182
00:16:07,373 --> 00:16:10,683  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:451 Y2:516
Live hornets.
We smoosh them right into dough.

183
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:14,044  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I don't care if it's horse manure.
- That's good.

184
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:17,882  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:454 Y2:516
I want to buy this franchise.
How's $ 1 00,000?

185
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:21,449  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:451 Y2:516
No! We come to Earth
to make pizza, not money!

186
00:16:21,653 --> 00:16:25,407  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:451 Y2:516
- No, Blek! Other way around.
- Right. Offer accepted!

187
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:32,885  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:516
Fans, Boston's turning the last game
into a real "squeeeker".

188
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:38,730  X1:084 X2:632 Y1:450 Y2:516
And that's with three "E's"! Two men on,
and they're down to their last out.

189
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:42,892  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:450 Y2:516
It's my last chance to prove
I'm not the worst player ever.

190
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:46,569  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Put me in.
- No! We're actually winning this game!

191
00:16:46,813 --> 00:16:52,365  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:451 Y2:516
You only go in as a joke
when we're eight runs behind!

192
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:56,561  X1:101 X2:615 Y1:456 Y2:516
Come on!
Let's see some fundamentals out there!

193
00:16:56,813 --> 00:16:59,122  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:495 Y2:516
And not clown fundamentals!

194
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:10,245  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:456 Y2:516
Darn! Darn! Darn!
Now the bases are loaded!

195
00:17:10,453 --> 00:17:13,490  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:516
Isn't there a man
who can get one more out?!

196
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,884  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:451 Y2:516
- I can!
- I repeat. Isn't there a man on...

197
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:21,490  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:455 Y2:516
- I've been training with Hank Aaron!
- The Hank Aaron?

198
00:17:21,693 --> 00:17:24,366  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:450 Y2:516
- I've trained with a Hank Aaron.
- All right then...

199
00:17:24,573 --> 00:17:29,647  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:450 Y2:516
...get in there and pitch like you've
never pitched like you before!

200
00:17:29,853 --> 00:17:34,324  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:451 Y2:516
<i>Now pitching for the Mets,</i>
<i>Turanga Leela!</i>

201
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:38,242  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:454 Y2:516
- Bean! Bean! Bean!
- Go, Leela! Go!

202
00:17:40,053 --> 00:17:42,408  X1:217 X2:498 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Go, Leela!
- Put it down the pike!

203
00:17:42,613 --> 00:17:47,050  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:451 Y2:516
Strike him out! Do it for the hundreds
of women everywhere!

204
00:17:48,173 --> 00:17:54,282  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:453 Y2:516
<i>Your attention! Now pinch-hitting</i>
<i>for the Poindexters, Jackie Anderson!</i>

205
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:59,483  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:455 Y2:516
Look! College blernsball's
finest female hitter...

206
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:03,362  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:451 Y2:516
...making her debut against
the worst female anything.

207
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:08,289  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:455 Y2:516
I've never seen anything this weird
and I've seen Mr. Belvedere naked!

208
00:18:08,573 --> 00:18:11,167  X1:179 X2:535 Y1:451 Y2:516
Keep cool.
She's like any other player.

209
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:14,843  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:456 Y2:516
She puts on her sports bra
one arm at a time.

210
00:18:18,253 --> 00:18:20,448  X1:287 X2:427 Y1:495 Y2:516
Strike one!

211
00:18:21,013 --> 00:18:24,642  X1:175 X2:539 Y1:490 Y2:516
Strike one! A personal best!

212
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:28,362  X1:286 X2:428 Y1:495 Y2:516
Strike two!

213
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:34,288  X1:161 X2:553 Y1:451 Y2:516
This moment is brought
to you by Month Old Franks...

214
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:37,331  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:490 Y2:516
...the hot dogs with experience!

215
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:25,365  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:456 Y2:516
A grand slam blern! The Mets lose!
Their season is over!

216
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:29,327  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:061 Y2:126
Leela, the first woman ever
to reach the majors...

217
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:33,725  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:061 Y2:126
...will go down as the worst player
in the history of blernsball.

218
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:37,767  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:450 Y2:516
She's taught the world
that being a bum knows no gender.

219
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:42,050  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:516
Tonight we've seen the start
of a great career...

220
00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:47,572  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:451 Y2:516
...for the first woman to play
the sport well, Jackie Anderson!

221
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:54,370  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:451 Y2:516
- Leela?
- Jackie. I guess you were right...

222
00:19:54,613 --> 00:19:58,447  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:453 Y2:516
...I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

223
00:19:58,653 --> 00:20:02,851  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:456 Y2:516
- You were an inspiration after all.
- I was?

224
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:09,401  X1:095 X2:619 Y1:451 Y2:516
You were so awful that women set out
to prove they don't stink as bad as you.

225
00:20:09,613 --> 00:20:14,004  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:516
That's so kind of you.
I guess I made a difference after all.

226
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,852  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:451 Y2:516
You absolutely did, Leela.
Now please...

227
00:20:17,093 --> 00:20:21,052  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:490 Y2:516
...please retire. Immediately.

228
00:20:22,253 --> 00:20:24,403  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:490 Y2:516
Hey, kid! Catch.

229
00:20:33,653 --> 00:20:37,248  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:516
You're still the worst
football player of all time.

230
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:38,966  X1:321 X2:393 Y1:495 Y2:516
Yeah.

231
00:20:39,213 --> 00:20:41,249  X1:321 X2:393 Y1:495 Y2:516
Yeah.
