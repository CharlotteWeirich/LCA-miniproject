00:20:21,268 --> 00:20:24,738
ZOIDBERG: As the candy hearts
poured into the fiery quasar...

306
00:20:24,908 --> 00:20:27,627
...a wondrous thing happened,
why not?

307
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:30,581
They vaporized
into a mystical love radiation...

308
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:34,747
... that spread across the universe,
destroying many, many planets...

309
00:20:34,908 --> 00:20:37,706
...including two gangster planets
and a cowboy world.

310
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:42,504
But one planet was exactly the right
distance to see the romantic rays...

311
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:46,456
...but not be destroyed by them. Earth.

312
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:50,541
So all over the world,
couples stood together in joy.

313
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,266
And me, Zoidberg.

314
00:20:52,428 --> 00:20:58,503
No one could have been happier, unless
it would have also been Valentine's Day.

315
00:20:58,668 --> 00:21:01,819
What? It was? Hooray!
