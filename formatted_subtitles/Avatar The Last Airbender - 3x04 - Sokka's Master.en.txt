katara water...
earth...
fire...
air.
long ago...
the four natio lived
together in harmony.
then everything change
when the fire nation attacked.
only the avatar, master of all
four elements could stophem.
but when the world
needed him most
he vanished.
and i discovered the new avatar
an airbender named aang.
and although his airbending
skills were great
he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.
but i believe aang
can save the world.
man previously on "avatar... "
aang blending in is better
than hiding out.
if we get fire nation disguises, we'll be
just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave.
you have no right
to judge me, uncle.
i did what i had to do in ba sing se,
and you wer a fool for not joining me.
i see you favor
the white lotus gambit.
not many still cling
to the ancient ways.
those who do can always
find a friend.
katara wow, this is amazing
to watch.
kind of makes you realize
how insignificant we are.
eh, u've seen nothing once,
you've seen it 1,000 times.
sokka oh, man.
you've never not seen
anything like this.
katara the fire is gonna
destroy that town.
aangnot if we can stop it.
there's a creek over here.
i'll bend the water
on to the fire.
toph, let's make a trench to keep
the fire from coming any closer.
what should i do?
keep an eye on momo.
so what, i'm just
a ler-sitter?
there, there.
feel better?
sokka, stand clear.
right, stand clear.
got it.
good work, everybody.
man look at you.
you're just a fat,
disgusting old man.
you do nothing, you say nothing.
you just eat and roll around
in your own filth like a pig.
you're a disgrace.
these people have no idea how close
they were to getting toasted last night.
yeah, the worst thing
about being in disguise
is we don't get
the hero worship anymore.
i miss the love.
boo-hoo, poor heroes.
what's your oblem?
you haven't even touched
your smoked sea slug.
it's just, all you guys can do
this awesome bending stuff
like putting out forest fires, and flying
around, and making other stuff fly around.
i can't fly around, ok?
i can't do anything.
that's not true.
no one can read a map ke you.
i can't read at all.
yeah, and who keeps us laughing
with sarcastic comments all the time?
i mean,
lo at katara's hair, right?
what's up with that?
what?
what's wrong with my hair?
nothing, i was just trying to...
sokka look, i appreciat
the effort, but the fact is
each of you is so amazing
and so special, and i'm not.
i'm just the guy
in the group who's regular.
i'm sorry you're feeling so down, but i
hope yoknow none of us see you that way.
i know something that's gonna
ma you feel better.
you do?
shopping.
maybe a little something
to rnvigorate my battling.
hey, how about these?
hi-ya!
"smack-a-dacka-doo!"
aang what do you think?
pretty slick, huh?
all i need to complete
the outfit is a wind sword.
what's a wind sword?
it's where i get a sword handle
and then i just swing this around
and bend air out like a blade.
yeah, nice.
i'll jt ick to what i got.
ooh.
that's what sokka's
talking about.
man you have a good eye.
that's an original from piandao
the greate sword master and
sword mar in fire nation history.
he lives in the big castle
up the road from here.
that's it.
that's what you needed
all along, sokka.
a sword?
not the sword.
a master.
we've all had masters
to help us get better.
you should see if you
can study with piandao.
that's a great idea.
i could've never gotten to where
i am without master pakku.
everyone needs a teacher.
i learned from badger moles.
they don't talk,
but they're still od teachers.
it would be nice to be
a master swordfighter.
all right, i'll talk to him.
can i help you?
i've come to train
with the master.
you should know the master
turns almost everyone away.
what did you bring him
to prove your worth?
well, uh...
right.
let's get this over with.
master, my name is sokka, and i wish to
be instructed in the way of the sword.
piandao sokka.
that's an unusual name.
oh, uh, really?
uh, where i come from,
the fire nation colonies
it's a pretty normal name,
for fire nation colonials.
piandao let me guess.
you've come hundreds of miles
from your little village
where you're the best
swordsman in town
and you think you deserve
to learn from the master.
well, actually, i've been
all over the world.
piandao yep, here we go.
i have a lot to learn.
you're not doing a very good job
of selling yourself.
i know.
your butler told me that when i
met you, i would have to prove worth
but the truth is,
i don't know if i am worthy.
hm, i see.
wellthen, let's find out
together how worthy you are.
i will train you.
rself.
you must think of it as
another part of your own body.
like a second head.
well, more like
an extra-long, really sharp arm.
the sword is a simple tool,
but in the hands of a master
it becomes the most versatile of weapons,
and just as the imagination is limitless
so too are the possibilities
of the sword.
aang what should we do today?
i'm tapped out.
i already picked my toes, twice.
twice?
the first time was for cleaning, but the second
time's just for the sweet picking sensation.
sokka's been in charge
of the schedule.
i'm not sure
what we should be doing.
plus, it's so hot today.
how hot is it?
i don't know.
real hot?
it's so hot, it's so hot,
momo is shedding like appa.
huh, huh?
i guess the jokes
don't run in the family.
katara oh, everyone's a critic.
the warrior practices a variety of
arts to keep his mind sharp and fluid.
the first you will learn
is calligraphy.
write your name.
writing my name will make me
a better swordsman?
when you write your name, you
stamp the paper with your identity
you must learn to use your sword to
stamp your identity on a battlefield.
remember, you cannot take back a stroke
of the brush, or a stroke of the sword.
you are getting ink
on your face.
i am?
i am.
so this is about putting
my identity on the page, right?
landscape painting teaches a warrior
to hold the lay of the land in his mind.
in battle, you only have an
instant to take everything in.
now, paint it.
and no peeking.
sokka i'm finished.
you added a rainbow.
is that ok?
piandao sokka.
concentrate on
what you're doing.
rock gardening teaches the warrior
to manipulate his surroundings
and use them to his advantage.
hm, manipulate them
to my advantage.
oh.
ah.
hey, would you mind grabbing
a cold drink for m
i'll take a slice of lemon
in mine, please.
what's going on in there?
crazy old man.
katara so where are
we going next?
we're starting from here.
no, we're over on this island.
you noodle-brains don't know
what you're doing.
i miss sokka.
ooh, i got one.
if you miss him so much,
why don't you marry him?
piandao you've had a good
first day of training.
i have?
but i thought i messed up
every single thing we worked on.
you messed things up
in a very special way.
you are ready for a real sword.
are you giving me one of yours?
no.
your sword must be
an extension of yourself
so tomorw, you will make
your own sword.
choosing the correct material the most
important step in crafting a sword.
you must trust your steel
with your life.
choose carefully.
master, would it be possible for me to leave
and bring back a special material for my sword?
i wouldn't have it
any other way.
sokka's coming.
hey, guys.
what are you doing?
aang sokka?
to you're back.
we missed you so much.
say something funny.
funny how?
what's the deal?
i don't know.
they missed you or something.
i didn't care.
thanks.
that warms my heart.
anyway, i need some help.
who's this?
oh, these are my friends.
just other good
fire nation folks.
do you think we can make
a sword out of a meteorite?
we'll make a sword unlike
any other in the world.
sokka, when you first arrived,
you were so unsure.
you even seemed
down on yourself.
but i saw something
in you right away.
i saw a heart as strong as
a lion turtle, and twice as g
and as we trained, it wasn't
your skills that impressed me.
no, it certainly
wasn't your skills.
you showed something
beyond that.
creativity, versatility,
intelligence.
these are the traits
that define a great swordsman
and these are the traits
that define you.
you told me you didn't know
if you were rthy
but i believe that you are more worthy
than any man i have ever trained.
i'm sorry, master.
you're wrong.
i am not worthy.
i'm not who you think i am.
i'm not from the fire nation.
i'm from the southern
water tribe.
i lied so that i could
learn swordsmanship from you.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry, too.
no, this is my fight, alone.
you used to be
the pride of the fire nation.
our top general,
the dragon of the west.
now, look at you.
piandao excellent.
using your superior agility
against an older opponent.
smart.
piandao good use of train.
fighting from the high ground.
yes, use your surrouings.
make them fight for you.
very resourceful.
excellent work, sokka.
i think i'm a little old
to be fighting the avatar.
how did you know?
oh, i've been around a while.
you pick things up.
of course, i knew from the
beginning that sokka was water tribe.
you might want to think of
a better fire nation cover name.
try "lee."
there's a million lees.
the way of the sword doesn't
belong to any one nation.
knowledge of the arts
belongs to us all.
soa, you must continue
your training on your own.
if you stay on this path,
i know that one day
you will becoman even
greater master than i am.
wait.
the master wanted you to have this,
as something to remember him by.
it's a pal sho tile.
aang the white lotus.
hm.
katara what does it mean?
i have no idea.
ooh, that reminds me.
toph, i thought
you might like this
since you've probably never had a
chance to bend space earth before.
sweet.
check this out.
you know, i don't think there's
such a thing as "space earth."
if it's from space,
then it's not really earth.
sokka must you ruin everything?
katara i can't believe
i missed you.
