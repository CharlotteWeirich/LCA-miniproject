Guard
Line them up for the Warden!
Dad. Excuse me, coming through.
The Warden wants me over there, sorry.
Warden
Welcome to The Boiling Rock.
I'm sure you've all heard the
horrible rumors about our little island.
Well I just want to tell you
that they don't have to be true.
As long as you do everything I say.
Look me in the eye when I'm talking to you.
Hakoda No.
Oh, you'd rather look at my shoes?
Then take a look!
I know exactly who you are,
Hakoda of the Water Tribe. So strong willed.
But don't worry, we'll get rid
of that in time. Now look me in the eye.
See? Isn't that better. You will all
do as I say or pay the price. You will all...
Are you okay, Sir?
I'm fine! Get these
prisoners out of my sight!
Thank goodness you're okay.
If you take one step closer
you'll see just how okay I am.
Dad, it's me.
Sokka, my son.
You know Sokka, you should be
more careful with that guard outfit on.
I almost punched you in the gut.
Yeah, I ran into that problem earlier.
Are you comfortable
Chit Sang?
If you're trying to get me to talk,
forget it. I'm not a squealer.
Chit Sang, I only asked
you if you were comfortable.
Well, yeah. Actually,
I am pretty comfortable.
Are you still comfortable?
No.
I know you and your cronies are not smart
enough to come up with that little escape plan.
So you're gonna tell me.
Who is?
So where's Bato? Where's
everyone else from the invasion?
The others are being held
at a prison near the Fire Nation palace.
They singled me out as
their leader and sent me here.
But before I left I met some young women
who said they knew you. The Yoshinama Fighters?
You mean the Kyoshi Warriors?
That's right.
Their leader Suki is here
and she's gonna escape with us.
Good, we'll need
all the help we can get.
And you know Prince Zuko?
The son of the Firelord?
I don't know him, but I knew of him.
Well, he's here too.
Sounds like a major problem.
Actually,
he's on our side now.
I know, I had the same reaction.
After all he has done, it was hard to trust him.
But he's really proven himself and
I never would have found you without his help.
So, do you have a plan?
We had one but some of the other
prisoners got involved and ruined it.
I don't know if there's
another way off this island.
Sokka, there's no prison in the World
that can hold two Water Tribe geniuses.
Then we'd better find two.
Zuko, are you there?
I'm here.
I just got done talking to my Dad.
We came up with an escape plan together.
Male Guard
What are you doing here?
I was just telling this
dirty lowlife what I think of him!
Well, you'll have to do
that later, he's coming with us.
Why?
Female Guard Because we have
orders straight from the Warden. That's why.
Could I just get 10 more
seconds to rough him up a bit?
Fine, ten seconds.
Sokka
Take that! And this!
Newbie.
We have a new plan but
it's gonna need a big distraction.
Be in the yard in one hour.
Alright,
that's enough.
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?
I didn't do anything wrong.
Mai Come on Zuko.
We all know that's a lie.
Mai.
How is he?
I think he's ready to talk.
Have you had enough
time to think about what I asked?
Yes.
And?
You're right. There was another
person involved in the escape plan.
Who?
It's a guy who's disguised like a
prison guard, only he's not a prison guard.
He's the mastermind.
He came up with the plan.
How did you know I was here?
Because I know you so well.
But... how?
The Warden's my Uncle you idiot.
The truth is, I guess I don't know you.
All I get is a letter. You could have at least
looked me in the eye when you ripped out my heart.
I didn't mean to...
You didn't mean to?
Dear Mai, I'm sorry that
you have to find out this way, but I'm leaving.
Stop! This isn't about you.
This is about the Fire Nation.
Thanks Zuko.
That makes me feel all better.
Mai, I never wanted to hurt you.
But I have to do this to save my country.
Save it?
You're betraying your country.
That's not how I see it.
Sokka,
what's going on?
I don't have much time. If I'm seen with
you the guards might think something's up.
I just talked to my Dad.
That's great.
Yeah and we're escaping today.
On the gondola.
What?
My dad and I came up
with a plan together.
We're gonna commandeer the gondola and we're
gonna take a hostage with us so they won't cut the lines.
We'll never make it onto the gondola.
There's too many guards.
My dad already thought of that.
He said we'll need a distraction.
That's why we're
gonna start a prison riot.
Okay. Let's say by some miracle this
all works and we make it on the gondola.
The Warden will still just cut
the lines, even if we have a captive.
Not if the Warden is the captive.
I have to go.
I'll find you before we start the riot.
Male Guard Hey you!
The Warden wants to see you.
Why?
I don't know. I didn't ask.
Maybe I could schedule another
time with him? How's tomorrow?
He wants to see you,
now.
Warden
Put him in the line up.
One of you is an imposter
who thought he could fool me.
But now that person is
going to be in a lot of trouble.
Who is it?
Chit Sang That's him, Warden.
He's the imposter.
Bully Guard What?! I am not.
He's lying! He's a liar!
Bully Guard I'm telling you,
it wasn't me.
Save your breath. I know
you've been working together.
You threw Chit Sang in the very cooler
they used to escape. It was all part of your plan.
That was just a coincidence.
Guard
Sir, there's someone to see you.
Who told you to interrupt me!
Azula I did.
Warden Princess Azula.
Uh, it is an honor to welcome you to the Fire Nation's
most exemplary prison. I didn't realize you were coming.
Who is this?
He's a guard who was involved
in a recent and feeble escape attempt.
It wasn't me.
Quiet you.
You're wasting your time.
That's not one of them.
How do you know?
Because I'm a people person.
Sokka Hey, I just got orders.
Let the prisoners out into the yard.
Guard But we’re in
the middle of lockdown.
Oh, okay. I'll just go tell
the Warden you said that.
I'm sure he'll be glad to hear about you
undermining his authority. What's your name again?
Wait. Don't tell the Warden,
I… I'm just a little confused.
Hey, I'm confused too. But the
Warden's in a bad mood and irrational.
So if you ask me, it's best not to
question it and just do what he says.
Yeah, you're right.
We're letting them out.
This is it.
We have to start a riot.
Okay,
but how do we do that?
I'll show you.
Prisoner Hey, why did you do that for?
That hurt my feelings.
Aren't you mad at me?
Uhh, well normally I would be,
but I've been working to control my anger.
This isn't working.
Chit Sang Hey you.
You're lucky I didn't rat you out.
But my generosity
comes with a price.
I know you're planning
another escape attempt and I want in.
Actually,
we're trying to escape right now.
But we need a riot. You wouldn't
happen to know how to start one would you?
A prison riot?
Please.
Hey! Riot!
Impressive.
Prisoner Forget about
controlling my anger. Let's riot!
Warden Who let these prisoners
into the yard? This is supposed to be a lockdown!
Guard Ma'am, there's
a riot going on. I'm here to protect you.
I don't need any protection.
Hah, believe me.
She doesn't.
I'm sorry but I'm under direct orders
from your Uncle to make sure nothing happens.
Get off of me!
Zuko, good. We're all here. Now all we need
to do is grab the Warden and get to the gondolas.
And how do we do that?
I'm not sure.
Argh, I thought
you thought this through.
I thought you told me it's okay
not to think everything through!
Maybe not everything.
But this is kind of important.
Chit Sang Hey, uhh, fellas.
I think your girlfriend's taking care of it.
You wouldn't dare.
Sorry Warden,
you're my prisoner now.
We've got the Warden,
now let's get out of here.
That's some girl.
Tell me about it.
We're almost there.
Back off,
we've got the Warden.
Let's go.
Everyone in.
What are you doing?
I'm making it
so they can't stop us.
Way to think ahead.
We're on our way.
Wait.
Who's that?
Zuko That's a problem.
It's my sister and her friend.
This is a rematch
I've been waiting for.
Me too.
Guard #1
There's the Warden. I see him!
Cut the line!
Guard #2
He wants us to cut the line.
Guard #3 But if we cut the line,
there's no way he'll survive.
Guard #1 He knows that.
Ty Lee
They're about to cut the line!
Then it's time to leave.
Goodbye Zuko.
They're cutting the line.
The gondola's about to go!
Hakoda
I hope this thing floats.
Guard
What are you doing?!
Saving the jerk who dumped me.
Who is that?
It's Mai.
What is she doing?
Sorry Warden,
your record is officially broken.
Well, we made it out.
Now what?
Zuko, what are you doing?
My sister was on that island.
Yeah and she's probably
right behind us. So let's not stop.
What I mean is she
must have come here somehow.
There.
That's our way out of here.
Azula Leave us alone.
I never expected this from you.
The thing I don't understand is why?
Why would you do it? You know the consequences.
I guess you just don't know
people as well as you think you do.
You miscalculated.
I love Zuko more than I fear you.
No, you miscalculated!
You should have feared me more!
Come on,
let's get out of here!
You’re both fools.
What shall we do with them,
princess?
Put them somewhere I'll never have
to see their faces again. And let them rot.
Katara What are you doing in this thing?
What happened to the war balloon?
It kind of got destroyed.
Sounds like a crazy fishing trip.
Did you at least
get some good meat?
I did. The best meat of all.
The meat of friendship and fatherhood.
Chit Sang
I'm new. What's up everybody?
Dad.
Hi, Katara.
How are you here?
What is going on? Where did you go?
We
kind of went to a Fire Nation prison.
Seriously,
you guys didn't find any meat?
