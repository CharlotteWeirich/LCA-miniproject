Katara water.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.
Then, everything changed
when the fire nation attacked.
Only the avatar,
master of all four elements,
could stop them.
But when the world
needed him most, he vanished.
and i discovered the new avatar,
an airbender named aang
And although his
airbending skills are great
He has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.
But i believe aang
can save the world.
Man previously on "avatar."
I need you, zuko.
I've plotted every move
of this day, and the only way
we win is together.
We've done it, zuko.
The fire nation
has conquered ba sing se.
Zuko i betrayed uncle.
Azula no, he betrayed you.
When you return home, father
will welcome you as a war hero.
But i don't have the avatar.
What if father
doesn't restore my honor?
What happened?
Oh, no!
Man you hear something?
Man he's awake.
Stop, wait!
Momo?
Twinkle-Toes, that's got
to be you.
Aang, you're awake.
Aang are you sure?
I feel like i'm dremaing.
You're not dreaming.
You're finally awake.
Aang, good to see you
back with the living, buddy.
Sokka?
Uh-Oh, somebody catch him.
He's gonna...
Aren't you cold?
I've got a lot on my mind.
It's been so long.
Over three years
since i was home.
I wonder what's changed.
I wonder how i've changed.
I just asked if you were cold.
I didn't ask
for your whole life story.
Stop worrying.
Aang why are we on
a fire nation ship?
Why is everyone
dressed this way?
And why am i the only one
who's completely out of it?
You need to take it easy, o.K.?
You got hurt pretty bad.
I like your hair.
I have hair?
How long was i out?
A few weeks.
Everything ok?
We're fine, dad.
I'm hakoda, katara
and sokka's father.
He knows who you are.
I just called you "dad,"
didn't i?
I guess you're right.
Nice to officially
meet you, chief hakoda.
It's an honor to meet you.
Great, great.
Now you guys have finally met,
so would you mind giving us
a little privacy?
Of course.
Are you mad at
your dad or something?
What?
Not at all.
Why would you say that?
Mmm-Mmm.
Maybe we should go upstairs.
You need a healing session.
Tell me where your pain
feels most intense.
A little higher.
Wow.
You're definitely in
the right area there.
I can feel a lot of energy
twisted up around there.
Let me just see if i can...
I went down.
I didn't just get hurt, did i?
It was worse than that.
I was gone,
but you brought me back.
I just used the spirit water
from the north pole.
I don't know
what i did, exactly.
You saved me.
You need to rest.
Woman your princess azula,
clever and beautiful
Disguised herself as
the enemy and entered
the earth kingdom's capital.
In ba sing se, she found
her brother zuko, and together,
they faced the avatar.
Women and the avatar fell,
and the earth kingdom fell.
Woman azula's agents quickly
overtook the entire city.
They went to ba sing se's
great walls...
...and brought them down.
The armies of the fire nation
surged through the wall
And swarmed over ba sing se,
securing our victory.
Women now the heroes
have returned home.
Woman your princess, azula.
And after three long years,
your prince has returned.
Zuko.
After what happened
in ba sing se,
we had to get you to safety.
We flew back to chameleon bay,
where we found my father
and the other water tribe men.
The earth king decided he wanted
to travel the world in disguise,
so he set off alone.
Well, not completely alone.
Soon, the bay was overrun
with fire nation ships.
Rather than fight them all,
we captured a single ship
and made it our disguise.
Since then,
we've been traveling west.
We crossed through
the serpent's pass
a few days ago.
We've seen a few
fire nation ships,
but none have bothered us.
So, what now?
We've been working on
a modified version
of the invasion plan.
It's sokka's invasion plan.
Yes, sokka's plan.
We won't be able to mount
a massive invasion without
the earth king's armies
But the solar eclipse
will still leave
the fire nation vulnerable.
So we're planning
a smaller invasion.
Just a ragtag team
of our friends and alls
from around the earth kingdom.
We already ran into
pipsqueak and the duke.
Good to see you again, aang.
And the best part is,
the eclipse isn't even
our biggest advantage.
We have a secret.
You.
Me?
Yep, the whole world
thinks you're dead.
Isn't that great?
The world thinks i'm dead?
How is that good news?
That's terrible.
No, it's great.
It means the fire nation
won't be hunting us anymore.
And even better,
they won't be expecting you
on the day of black sun.
No, no, no, no, no.
You have no idea.
This is so messed up.
I'll handle this.
The avatar is back.
Katara aang, wait.
Remember, they don't know
we're not fire nation.
Everyone, just stay calm.
Bato and i
will take care of this.
I hate not being able
to do anything.
Hopefully, you won't need to.
Commander, why are you
off course?
All western fleet ships
are supposed to be moving
Toward ba sing se to support
the occupation.
Actually, we're from
the eastern fleet.
We have orders
to deliver some cargo.
Ah, eastern fleet.
Well, nice of admiral chan
to let us know he was sending
one of his ships our way.
I'm sure admiral chan
meant no disrespect, sir.
I mean, how hard is it
to write a quick note
and send a hawk our way?
Next time, we'll send two hawks,
to be sure you get the message.
Sir, admiral chan has been
on leave for two months
at ember island.
What?
Why doesn't anyone
ever tell me anything?
Something's not right.
They should've known that.
I think this is a captured ship.
Just stay quiet until
we're safely across the ramp.
Then we'll sink this ship.
They know!
You seem so downcast.
Has mai gotten to you already?
Though actually, mai has been in
a strangely good mood lately.
I haven't seen dad yet.
I haven't seen him
in three years,
since i was banished.
Azula so what?
So, i didn't capture the avatar.
Who cares?
The avatar's dead.
Unless you think he somehow
miraculously survived.
This is water from
the spirit oasis
at the north pole.
It has special properties,
so i've been saving it
for something important.
No.
There's no way
he could've survived.
Well, then i'm sure you
have nothing to worry about.
I'm gonna give us some cover.
I can't just stand by
and do nothing.
Aang, no!
You're still hurt,
and you have to stay secret.
Just let us handle this.
Fine.
Katara how we doing?
Things couldn't get much worse.
The universe just loves
proving me wrong, doesn't it?
You make it too easy.
Thank you, the universe.
Hey, aang.
We're going into town
to find some dinner.
Well, i am pretty hungry.
Maybe dinner's a good idea.
Here, tie this around your head.
It'll cover your arrow.
I'm not going out if
i can't wear my arrow proudly.
Aang, come on.
Be practical.
You guys go ahead without us.
We'll catch up with you.
I think i understand why being
a secret bothers you so much.
You don't want people
to think you failed.
You're right, i don't.
But the problem is, i did fail.
Aang, that's not true.
It is true.
I was in ba sing se.
I was there, but i lost.
And now, the earth kingdom
has fallen for good.
It's not for good.
Remember, there's still a plan.
The invasion.
And i hate
the invasion plan, too.
I don't want you or anyone else
risking your lives
to fix my mistakes.
I've always known that i would
have to face the fire lord
But now, i know i need
to do it alone.
Aang.
Katara, please.
Just go, please.
Is there anything you need?
I need to redeem myself.
I need my honor back.
I brought you some food.
Oh, no.
You have been away
for a long time.
I see the weight of your travels
has changed you.
You have redeemed yourself,
my son.
Welcome home.
I'll leave you two alone.
What's wrong, katara?
He left.
What?
Aang.
He just took his glider
and disappeared.
He has this ridiculous notion
that he has to save
the world alone
That it's all
his responsibility.
Maybe that's his way
of being brave.
It's not brave.
It's selfish and stupid.
We could be helping him,
and i know the world needs him
But doesn't he know how much
that we need him too?
How could he just
leave us behind?
You're talking about me too,
aren't you?
How could you leave us, dad?
I mean, i know we had gran gran,
and she loved us, but... but we
were just so lost without you.
I'm so sorry, katara.
I understand why you left.
I really do, and i know
that you had to go,
so why do i still feel this way?
I was so sad and angry,
and hurt.
I love you more than anything.
You and your brother
are my entire world.
I thought about you every day
i was gone, and every night
when i went to sleep
I would lie awake missing you
so much, it would ache.
Ozai i am proud of you,
prince zuko.
I am proud because you
and your sister
conquered ba sing se.
I am proud because,
when your loyalty was tested
by your treacherous uncle
You did the right thing
and captured the traitor
And i am proudest
of all of your most
legendary accomplishment.
You slayed the avatar.
What did you hear?
Azula told me everything.
She said she was
amazed and impressed
With your power and ferocity
at the moment of truth.
Aang blockade.
Zuko why'd you do it?
You're going to have to be
a little more specific.
Why did you tell father
that i was the one
who killed the avatar?
Azula can't this wait
until morning?
It can't.
Fine.
You seemed so worried
about how father would treat you
Because you hadn't captured
the avatar.
I figured, if i gave you
the credit, you'd have nothing
to worry about.
But why?
Call it a generous gesture.
I wanted to thank you
for your help, and i was happy
to share the glory.
You're lying.
If you say so.
You have another motive
for doing this.
I just haven't figured out
what it is.
Please, zuko.
What ulterior motive
could i have?
What could i possibly gain
by letting you get all the glory
for defeating the avatar?
Unless, somehow,
the avatar was actually alive.
All that glory would suddenly
turn to shame and foolishness.
But you said yourself,
that was impossible.
Sleep well, "zuzu."
I'm not gonna make it.
I failed.
Roku?
You haven't failed, aang.
But everyone thinks
i'm dead again.
They think i've abandoned them,
and i'm losing this war.
I'm letting
the whole world down.
Roku if anyone is to blame
for the state of the world,
it is me.
I should've seen
this war coming,
and prevented it.
You inherited my problems
and my mistakes
But i believe you are destined
to redeem me,
and save the world.
I don't know.
Woman you already saved
the world.
And you'll save the world again.
But you can't give up.
You're right.
I won't give up.
You're ok.
I have so much to do.
I know,
but you'll have our help.
You didn't think
you could get out of training
Just by coming to
the fire nation, did you?
What about the invasion?
We'll join up with my dad
and the invasion force on
the day of the eclipse.
Hey, what's...?
Oh, it's your glider.
That's ok.
If someone saw it,
it would give away my identity.
It's better for now
that no one knows i'm alive.
