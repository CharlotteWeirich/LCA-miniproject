Ba-bum.
Previously on
The Dragon Prince...
So, the most important things,
I've written down.
A letter?
You'll understand in time.
I want you to break the seal when...
Well, you'll know when.
I have done terrible things.
I thought they were necessary.
Now, I don't know.
General Amaya reports
that Elvin forces are gathering
on the Xadian side of the Breach.
We must be prepared to fight,
and we won't be able to fight them alone.
The other four kingdoms
have agreed to a summit of the Pentarchy.
I will rally the kings and queens
behind Katolis
and finally destroy the Xadian threat!
Halt! Dismount, disarm,
and proceed alone to the meeting point.
Welcome.
How gracious.
You're the fourth to arrive.
May I say,
on behalf of all of the kingdoms,
we were deeply saddened
to hear of King Harrow's passing.
Thank you, King Ahling. That means a lot.
But we were reassured
when we received the scroll informing us
that you would be the regent of Katolis
until Ezran comes of age.
It is humbling to be trusted
with the boy's education and training,
as well as decisions of state.
And speaking of regents,
it seems we are only waiting
on the regent of Duren?
I apologize for my lateness.
Queen Aanya of Duren.
How you've grown.
Welcome.
Hmm. We are here to discuss
some rather weighty matters.
Will your regent be joining us soon?
I speak for myself now, and for my people.
Yes, this is a very serious situation.
I intend no offense, but these issues
require an adult perspective.
It seems I am a crown without an adult,
and you're an adult without a crown.
Let's just begin.
Very well.
I called us here today...
because I am afraid. Terrified.
After centuries
of fighting amongst ourselves,
the five human kingdoms
finally found a balance, an era of peace.
But a new threat has arisen to challenge
all of humanity...
a threat from Xadia.
On the night of the full moon,
the Dragon Queen sent assassins...
Moonshadow elves over the border,
and they murdered King Harrow.
Now, Sunfire elves
are gathering near the border.
An invasion is imminent.
Even worse, there are reports
of shadows in the clouds. Dragons.
Flying high
above the towns of Katolis.
When I close my eyes,
I see fire raining down,
death and destruction everywhere.
It won't stop in Katolis.
They will spread their wrath
to all the human kingdoms soon enough.
The time to stop Xadia is now.
We must stand together
to protect our common humanity.
I call on you to join me, to join Katolis.
Fight beside each other to drive back
this threat.
Ugh.
Ah, yes, the smell of land.
Sweet, sweet land.
Whoo-hoo!
Let him finish.
The faint, distant smell of land, that is.
There it is.
About a full day of sailing
ahead until we reach the shore.
Well, Zym, want to go count clouds again?
Or we could nap.
Lord Viren,
the people of Neolandia
understand the common humanity
that binds us.
If the other kingdoms
agree to act in unity,
we will commit to this alliance.
Yes. In unity,
you will have our support, as well.
King Florian?
If we are unanimous,
then the kingdom of Del Bar will join.
Queen Aanya, what say you?
I am... undecided.
"Undecided"?
Yes. It means I've yet to make up my mind.
This is why we need an adult.
A leader who can make strong choices
for their kingdom.
Everyone else here
was capable of making a decision.
I won't send my armies
to face unknown danger
based on a two-minute speech.
I may be a child, but apparently,
I'm the least impulsive of us all.
Besides, I hardly call
"we'll do what everyone else does"
a decision.
Well, she's got a fair point.
Perhaps, I was rash in my words.
I apologize.
You are a young queen,
but evidently far wiser than your years.
As a child ruler,
I have had to survive adults
trying to usurp my throne,
coups, conspiracies and assassinations.
But sometimes, it's not the hard threats,
but the soft threats that are the worst.
Sweet words can be more dangerous
than hidden daggers.
My 19-year-old doesn't know
half the words you just said.
And he still fights back
about eating his vegetables.
Queen Aanya, would you allow me
to share a story with you?
A story of a time when our kingdoms
worked together to achieve something...
miraculous.
Nine years ago, my oldest friend,
Prince Harrow, became the king of Katolis.
I remember the coronation
as if it were only yesterday.
Whoo!
I want to make a difference, Sarai.
You will.
You'll be a champion of love and justice.
And I'll be fighting by your side.
He was a beautiful young king
with a beautiful family,
and it was a time of hope in Katolis.
Are we done yet?
It looks pretty done to me.
Yes. It's beautiful.
An excellent likeness.
You can all move now.
No, hold on, you're not free yet.
I'm afraid the king
has to pose for one more.
Ah, my official portrait.
For history books and whatnot.
All right, ready?
Put on your best history face.
Why don't you join me, Viren?
But this is your official portrait
as king.
Yes, and you should stand next to me,
as I know you will stand by me
through anything.
I brought you a surprise.
Jelly tarts in bed?
We are the king and queen now,
we can do whatever we want.
Ah, someone's inherited your sweet tooth.
Ezran is a lucky boy.
Born a prince, as I was.
But there are so many in our kingdom
who were born with less.
Harrow, what troubles you?
Why do I deserve this?
What did I do,
except being born with everything?
You are humble, and grateful, and kind.
Sarai, my father told me that above all,
I must be a just king.
The night he died,
Lady Justice came to me in a dream.
Lady Justice, huh?
She was wearing her robes.
Ugh, so a boring dream.
May I continue?
Go on.
She said to me that justice was more
than fair decisions and fair consequences.
True justice was a fair system.
Then she laid before me her scales,
her sword, and her blindfold...
and told me to choose.
You chose the blindfold.
I did. She said the blindfold
gives us a way to test the system.
That I should use it to imagine
I had not been born yet,
and that I did not know
if I would be born rich or poor,
what color my skin would be,
what culture or practices
my family would have.
That a fair system should be fair
no matter the accident of my birth.
That the rights, and laws,
and opportunities within the system
should stand to protect
and empower everyone.
Lady Justice is wise.
Yes.
And she didn't make any moves on you?
Wise enough to know better.
You're especially inspiring
when you say things like that
with jelly smeared on your nose.
What?
King Harrow worked tirelessly.
He told me he thought of himself
as a servant of all the people of Katolis.
A servant king.
But one day,
two visitors came from a faraway place,
another kingdom, in fact.
They desperately needed
King Harrow's help.
Do you know
who these unexpected guests were?
They were my parents.
Yes.
Hey, can't a guy get a couple minutes
of below-deck privacy around here?
I'm serious, leave me alone.
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Why don't you join me down here?
I could use a little extra light.
Your parents, the queens of Duren,
carried themselves with great dignity,
but there was pain in their eyes.
No, please, you don't have to kneel.
We are here to humble ourselves
and beg your help.
The kingdom of Duren
has been suffering from a terrible famine
for nearly seven years.
Our food and resources are almost gone.
This winter, we will run out of food
and a hundred thousand people will die.
Then we will help you.
The kingdom of Katolis will share
all that we have with the people of Duren.
My king, with respect, you spoke too soon.
Katolis has barely enough food to sustain
its own people through the winter.
There is not a handful of grain to spare.
I won't turn my back on people in need.
If you share with them,
a hundred thousand people will still die,
but half of them
will be from our own kingdom.
Then it seems we have no choice.
Exactly. I'm sure they will understand.
We will share whatever we have with them.
And we will share in their suffering.
Harrow had committed help
far beyond our means.
That winter, starvation and death,
a devastating tragedy...
would be inevitable.
But a new possibility
presented itself to me.
I have been doing research.
Yes. I can see that.
Poring over ancient texts,
maps and archives.
And I may have found a creative solution.
Something that could save lives.
Well, go on!
Behold!
It's a rock.
This rock is, in fact,
a rare relic from Xadia.
It's a piece of a great monster,
a rocky giant
who lives high in the mountains.
A Magma Titan.
It's warm.
Yes.
Now, the titan lives
close to the border of Xadia.
If we can hunt this monster and slay it,
I can use the heart of the titan
in a powerful spell
that will warm the land,
and allow us
to magically grow an incredible bounty.
Enough to feed two kingdoms?
Enough to feed ten kingdoms.
Hmm.
Of course, at the time,
I was not the king's closest adviser.
It's a mistake, Harrow.
Why do you have such a problem with this?
We kill one monster
to save a hundred thousand people.
You keep calling it a monster.
Yes.
It's a giant beast made of rock and magma.
I call that a monster.
Is it intelligent?
What? What do you mean?
Does it think? Does it feel?
Does it have a family?
I sincerely doubt
it has a family.
Then is it the last of its kind?
Why does any of that matter?
I know it seems
like this will solve things,
but isn't it a little too easy?
That's always the way with dark magic.
What choice do we have?
You said you want to build a better world,
to really change things,
but that's going to take
decades of hard work.
There's no monster you can slay
and solve all your problems.
There's no shortcut.
This is going to be a very slippery slope!
Harrow, tell me you won't do this.
It's our only chance.
We will enter Xadia through the Breach.
There we can pick up supplies and...
I'm here.
Queen Sarai.
I thought you disapproved.
I disagree.
But I stand by you anyway.
Thank you.
I think this was
in our marriage vows, right?
Something about keeping you alive
when you're acting like a brave idiot?
Come on.
We traveled as quickly as we could
to the border.
Bold adventurers from two kingdoms
crossed the Breach together,
hoping to find a way to help their people.
Thunder, the King of the Dragons,
patrols the skies from dawn until dusk.
So, we will enter Xadia at sundown,
and we must return
with the heart of the titan
before the first moments
of the sun's rise.
Will these ballistas be able to
take down a Magma Titan?
If our aim is true,
we'll find the right spot
and get the job done.
What?
Nothing.
We emerged into darkness
and quickly got to work.
Let's go. The night is short.
With each step further into Xadia,
my heart beat louder
with excitement and fear.
This place held
both the promise of our salvation,
and the threat of our destruction.
We were ready for the fight of our lives.
We found the titan,
but it wasn't what we expected.
It's dead. What do we do now?
Don't sound so disappointed.
If it's dead, we don't need to kill it.
We just open it up and take what we need.
I've had his letter for a few days now,
but I just can't bring myself to open it.
I don't know. I know it sounds crazy,
but it's like, right now there are words
he hasn't said to me,
and they're all right in there.
They're just waiting to come to life.
But then once I read it...
once I read the last word...
then he'll really be gone.
Forever.
Okay. Thanks, Bait.
