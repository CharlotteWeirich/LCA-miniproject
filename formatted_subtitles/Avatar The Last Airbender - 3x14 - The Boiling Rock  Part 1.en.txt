Zuko No one can make tea like Uncle.
But hopefully I learned a thing or two.
Would you like to hear Uncle's favorite tea joke?
Katara Sure.
Aang I like jokes.
Toph
Bring it.
Zuko Okay. Well, I can't remember
how it starts but the punch line is...
"Leaf me alone, I'm bushed"
Well, it's funnier when Uncle tells it.
Right. Maybe that's because
he remembers the whole thing.
It's nice to get a chance to relax a little.
It hardly ever happens.
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
So what's up?
Sokka If someone was captured by the Fire Nation,
where would they be taken?
Zuko What do you mean?
Who was captured?
When the invasion plan failed,
some of our troops were taken.
I just want to know where they might be.
I can't tell you.
What? Why not?
Trust me. Knowing would just make you feel worse.
It's my Dad. He was captured too,
I need to know what I put him through.
It's not good Sokka.
Please.
My guess is
They were taken to the Boiling Rock.
What's that?
The highest security prison in the Fire Nation.
It's on an island in the middle of a boiling lake.
It's inescapable.
So where is this place?
Why do you need to know? What are you planning?
Nothing.
Boy, you're so paranoid.
It's in the middle of a volcano
between here and the Fire Nation.
You guys actually flew
right past it on your way here.
Thanks Zuko.
Just knowing makes me feel better.
Yeah, I'm sure it does.
Not up to anything, huh?
Fine, you caught me.
I'm gonna rescue my Dad. You happy now?
I'm never happy.
Look, I have to do this.
The invasion plan was my idea.
It was my decision to stay
when things were going wrong.
It's my mistake
and it's my job to fix it.
I have to regain my honor.
You can't stop me Zuko.
You need to regain your honor?
Believe me, I get it. I'm going with you.
No.
I have to do this alone.
How are you going to get there?
On Appa? Last time I checked...
...prisons don't have bison day cares.
We'll take my war balloon.
What does it say?
Need meat. Gone fishing.
Back in a few days. Sokka and Zuko.
One more thing...
Aang,
practice your firebending while I'm gone.
Do 20 sets of fire fists and 10 hot squats
every time you hear a badger frog croak. Zuko.
Nobody else has homework.
Pretty clouds.
Yeah, fluffy.
What?
What? Oh, I didn't say anything.
You know, a friend of mine
actually designed these war balloons.
No kidding.
Yep. A balloon. But for War.
There's one thing my Dad's good at,
it's War.
Yeah,
it seems to run in the family.
Hey, hold on.
Not everyone in my family is like that.
I know, I know,
you've changed.
I meant my Uncle.
He was more of a Father to me.
And I really let him down.
I think your Uncle would be proud of you.
Leaving your home to come help us, that's hard.
It wasn't that hard.
Really? You didn't leave behind
anyone you cared about?
Well I did have a girlfriend.
Mai.
That gloomy girl who sighs a lot?
Yeah.
Everyone in the Fire Nation thinks I'm a traitor.
I couldn't drag her into it.
My first girlfriend turned into the Moon.
That's rough buddy.
There it is.
There's plenty of steam to keep us covered.
As long as we're quiet we should be able
to navigate through it without being caught.
We're going down.
The balloon's not working anymore!
The air outside is just
as hot as the air inside so we can't fly.
So what are we supposed to do?
I don't know. Crash landing?
How are we gonna get off
the island if the balloon won't work?
We'll figure something out.
I suspected it might be a one-way ticket.
You knew this would happen
and you wanted to come anyway?
My Dad might be here.
I had to come and see.
Uncle always said I never thought
things through but this, ugh, this is just crazy.
Hey! I never wanted you to come along in the first place.
And for the record, I always think things through.
But my plans haven't exactly worked,
so this time I'm playing it by ear. So there.
What are you doing?
It doesn't work anyway.
And we don't want anyone to find it.
I hope you know what you're doing.
Zuko
There's no turning back now.
Zuko
I hope these disguises work.
Sokka We just need to lay low
and find my Dad as soon as possible.
Guards!
There's a scuffle in the yard, come on.
Chit Sang I didn't do anything.
I'm going back to my cell.
Bully Guard
Stop right there Chit Sang.
Sokka We can't blow our cover.
Bully Guard
I've had it with your unruly behavior.
What did I do?
He wants to know what he did.
Isn't that cute?
Zuko Uh, yeah, very cute sir.
Sokka Super cute.
You didn't bow down
when I walked by Chit Sang.
What?
That's not a prison rule.
Do it.
Make me.
Tsk, tsk. Firebending is prohibited.
You're going in the Cooler.
You!
Help me take him in.
Sokka
Meet back here in an hour.
Bully Guard
The Warden will deal with you soon.
Bully Guard
Can you believe this guy?
Sokka Prisoners. Am I right?
Bully Guard Ugh. Tell me about it.
Male Guard Hey new guy. I know it's the rule to have
your helmet on at all times but this is the lounge. Relax.
Zuko But what if there's an incident?
If I'm not prepared someone could strike me on the head.
Female Guard
Give it a week, he'll loosen up.
Can the new guy ask you
veterans a few questions about the prison?
No,
you can't date the female guards.
Trust me, you don't want to.
No, that's not it. The Boiling Rock, it holds
the Fire Nation's most dangerous criminals right?
So what about war prisoners?
It sure looks cold in there.
That's why we call it the Cooler.
He won't be firebending in there.
It's the Warden. Look alive.
Warden So Chit Sang, I hear you used
firebending to try to escape. You should know better.
I wasn't trying to escape.
Bully Guard He's lying.
I saw him with my own eyes.
No one has ever, ever escaped from here. I'd sooner
jump in the boiling lake myself than let that record fall.
Don't forget it.
Now go back to your shivering.
Zuko Hey there, fellow guard. How goes it?
Sokka Zuko?
Zuko Shh. Listen, I asked around the lounge. There are no
Water Tribe prisoners. I'm afraid your Father's not here.
What? Are you sure? Did you double check?
Yeah, I'm sure.
No. No!
I'm really sorry Sokka.
So we came all this way for nothing. I failed. Again.
Err, what would Uncle say?
Sometimes clouds have two sides,
a dark and light. And a silver lining in between.
It's like a silver sandwich. So...  when life
seems hard... take a bite out of the silver sandwich.
Maybe we haven't failed after all.
That's the spirit. I can't believe that worked.
I didn't even know what I was saying.
No, what you said made no sense at all.
But look, it's Suki!
Guard
Prisoners! Back in your cells!
What is it?
Did I do something wrong?
You mean you don't recognize me?
You people all look the same to me.
Oh.
Then maybe you'll recognize this.
Sokka, it's you.
The other Kyoshi Warriors,
are they here?
No, I don't know where they are.
They locked me here because I'm the leader.
Well, you won't be here for long,
I'm busting you out.
I'm so glad to see you Sokka.
I knew you'd come.
Female Guard
‘Scuse me, I need to get into that cell.
No,
you can't go in there.
The lights are out… the prisoner
could sneak up on you.
Step aside, fool.
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?
Guard, help! I think he's an imposter!
Argh! Arrest him!
Get him off me and arrest him!
You're under arrest!
Don't worry, I'll figure it out.
Warden Well, well, well.
I never thought I'd find you in here, Prince Zuko.
How did you know who I am?
How could I not?
You broke my niece's heart.
You're Mai's uncle?
I never meant to hurt her.
Quiet!
You're my special prisoner now.
And you best behave.
If these criminals found out who you are...
the traitor prince who let his nation down.
Why, they'd tear you to shreds.
So what's in it for you? Why don't you
just tell my Father and collect the reward.
Oh in due time believe me,
I intend to collect.
Oh, good. You guys have met.
A…actually, we met a long time ago.
We did?
Yeah, you kind of burned down my village.
Oh. Sorry about that.
Nice to see you again.
So listen,
I think I have an escape plan.
I checked out the Coolers again, the whole
point of them is to keep firebenders contained, right?
Yeah...
So they're completely
insulated and sealed to keep the cold in.
Well to keep the cold in it also
has to keep the heat out, right?
Just get to the point Sokka.
It's a perfect boat
for getting through the boiling water.
The cooler as a boat?
Are you sure?
I'm telling you, it'll work.
I walked around the perimeter.
There's a blind spot between two guard towers.
It's the perfect launching point.
I already tested it out.
We'll roll the cooler into the
water and just float with the current.
It'll take us straight across. As long
as we don't make a sound, no one will notice.
And bing, bang, boom
we're home free.
But how are you going
to get the cooler out?
Chit Sang Yeah,
how are you going to get the cooler out?
What?
We didn't. We… We didn't say that.
Yeah,
you heard wrong.
I heard you hatching
an escape plan and I want in.
There's nothing to get in on.
Yeah,
the only thing we're hatching is... an egg?
Ok, well, I come with you or the Warden
hears about this egg too.
I guess we have no choice.
Okay, you're in.
Now, first we need someone
to unbolt the Cooler. From the inside.
Oh,
I can get you inside.
Ugh. Hey, what are you, stupid?
Watch where you're going!
Hey,
you watch who you're shoving.
I think you mean
whom I'm shoving.
Sokka
I need backup over here.
Guard
No firebending. Into the cooler.
Sokka I can take you back to your
cell if you've learned your lesson.
Yes, I have.
Completely.
I got Suki and Chit Sang out
of their cells a few minutes ago.
They'll be waiting for us at the shore.
Someone's coming.
Male Guard Yeah,
new arrivals coming in at dawn.
Female Guard
Anybody interesting?
Nah, just the usual. Some robbers,
couple of traitors, some war prisoners.
Though I did hear
there might be a pirate.
Female Guard
No foolin’.
War prisoners.
It could be your Father.
I know.
Well, what should we do?
Are we going ahead with the
plan or are we waiting another night?
I don't know.
Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom?
All of our freedom on the slim
chance that my dad is gonna show up?
It's your call Sokka.
Took you guys long enough.
This here's my girl and my best buddy.
They're coming too.
Fine, everybody in the cooler.
Let's go.
Are you sure you want to go?
You're the one who said
you wanted to redeem yourself.
Redeem your honor.
Rescuing your Dad is your chance.
Your Dad?
If I had just cut my losses at the invasion,
maybe we wouldn't be in this mess.
Maybe sometimes it's just
better to call it quits before you fail.
No, it's not. Look Sokka,
you're going to fail a lot before things work out.
That's supposed to
make me feel better?
Even though you'll probably
fail over and over and over again.
Seriously, not helping.
You have to try every time. You can't
quit because you're afraid you might fail.
Hey, if you two are done
cuddling, can we get a move on?
No, I'm staying. You guys go.
You've been here long enough.
I'm not leaving without you, Sokka.
I'm staying too.
Not me, I'm out.
Let's roll baby.
We gave up our only chance of escaping.
I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake.
Argh, this current is so slow.
I can use this to paddle.
Guards! Secure the perimeter
and lock down the prisoners. Now!
The plan failed!
They're caught.
Get the fugitives and
throw them in the Cooler!
Uh, they are
in the cooler sir.
One that's bolted down and not
floating in the water! This is a lockdown!
We have new prisoners arriving!
Everything must be completely secure!
The gondola's moving.
This is it.
If my Dad's not there,
we risked everything for nothing.
We had to.
Come on,
come on.
Zuko
Is that him?
My Dad doesn't have a nose ring.
Where is he?
That's it? That can't be it.
I'm sorry Sokka.
Oh no.
Guard
Hey you, get off the gondola.
Dad.
