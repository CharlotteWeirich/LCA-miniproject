Shiro Shinobi says:  The Red Lotus is the world's newest threat. After confronting Zaheer, Korra learned that he is part of a secret society whose mission is to take out all the nations' leaders and destroy world order. But before Korra could warn anyone, she and Asami were apprehended by the Earth Queen's forces. And the Red Lotus have Mako and Bolin. Now both parties are headed toward Ba Sing Se.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  You have to let me out! The Earth Queen is in danger from a group of terrorists calling themselves the Red Lotus.  I talked to one of them in the Spirit World yesterday. He's insane!
Captain says:  Screaming about terrorists in the Spirit World? You're the one who sounds insane.

Asami says:  Do I have to be chained to the floor the whole way? It's going to be so uncomfortable.
Arik says:  Sorry Ma'am, I'm under orders.
Asami says: Can't you just chain me to that railing?  I mean, where am I gonna go?  Please?
Arik says: Well, as long as you're chained up, I guess it doesn't make a difference. 
Asami says: Thank you, Sir.
Korra says: Can I have ... some water?
Arik says: No water. We're also not going to bring you any rocks or fire, so don't ask. I guess there's air, but there's nothing we can do about that. We're not opening your compartment 'til we reach Ba Sing Se. 
Korra says: I hoped Mako or Bolin would have shown up to save us by now. I wonder if they're okay.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says:  If you think  holding us hostage will give you some leverage against the Avatar, you're gonna be very disappointed.
Ming-Hua says: Can't we just enjoy our time together in silence?
Mako says: And why did you need Korra alive back in Zaofu? You had her paralyzed. Why didn't you just take her out when you had the chance?
Ghazan says: Look, all you need to know is that the world is about to change, for the better.
Bolin says: So you guys were like locked up for fifteen years, huh? It must've been like crazy boring.
Ghazan says: Actually, it was only thirteen years. But it felt like thirty.
Bolin says: I mean, what did you do with all that time? Did you sing songs, work on crafts?
Ming-Hua says: Not a lot of craft supplies in a volcanic prison cell.
Ghazan says: And I must've renamed the constellations about a thousand times. When it rained, that was a big event.
Ming-Hua says:  I would've killed for some rain. Mostly I just made up stories about the guards: who was having trouble with his girlfriend; which one secretly wished he'd become a pastry chef.
Bolin says: Ooh okay, that sounds like fun. Let me try that on you guys.  You were raised by an older sister, your mustache grew in when you were ten and I'm sensing - just sensing - an unspoken attraction between you two.
Ghazan says:  Two out of three. Not bad.
Mako says: Bolin, would you stop making friends with the bad guys?
Bolin says: Sorry!
Zaheer says: Ghazan, gag those two. We're almost there.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: We have to find a way to get out of this prison before we get to the Earth Queen.
Asami says: Don't worry, I have a plan. These airships the Cabbage Corp sold to the Earth Kingdom are way cheaper than the ones Future Industries built.
Asami says: Now that's just shoddy workmanship.  There's no way I can get these locks off. I need the keys.  Give me five minutes, then start yelling for help.
</scene>

Hou-Ting says: When is the Avatar scheduled for delivery?
Gun says: The airship already left Fort Bosco and should be arriving in a few hours.
Hou-Ting says: Excellent. Bring it to me as soon as it lands.
Gun says: Yes, Your Majesty. But first there are some ... people here who captured two of the Avatar's friends. They would like to present them to you personally.
Hou-Ting says: You know I don't meet with bounty hunters.
Gun says: And of course I told them that. But they say they have some information that might interest you; about the location of your stolen airbenders.
Hou-Ting says: Really?  Fine, send them in.  Ah, yes, I remember these two. We'll find an acceptable home for you in prison, with the rest of the dissidents.  Now, I'm told you have some information for me. I hope this isn't just some ruse to increase your bounty.
Zaheer says: We don't want any bounty, Your Majesty. You can consider these two a "thank you" gift for simply taking the time to talk to us.
Hou-Ting says: How very magnanimous. So, where are my airbenders?
Zaheer says: I'd be happy to tell you, once you hand the Avatar over to me.
Hou-Ting says:  Who told you that we have the Avatar?!
Zaheer says: How I know is not important. But if I found out, others will too. And that could put you in a difficult position.
Hou-Ting says: Is that so?
Zaheer says: Your Majesty, imprisoning the Avatar will cause the other nations to turn against you and demand her freedom. Before long, we'd be in the midst of a sticky international incident. If you let me take her today, no one need ever know she was here, and you can get your airbenders back without interference. We both win.
Hou-Ting says: And what do you plan to do with the Avatar should I see fit to grant your request.
Zaheer says: All I can say is: I have business with her. But she won't be bothering you again. I can assure you of that. 
Hou-Ting says:  I find these terms agreeable. Gun, escort them to the antechamber until the Avatar's arrival.  Send these two to the dungeon.

<scene>
Korra says: Guards!  Get in here!  Something happened to my friend. She needs help.
Arik says:  Where is she?
Korra says: Nice work. Now let's take control of the ship.
</scene>

<scene>
Captain says: Mayday! Mayday! The Avatar has escaped. We're going down in quadrant four of the Si Wong Desert.
Asami says: I think you might have been a little over-aggressive with the airbending. The controls are busted.  Also, you broke the radio.
Korra says: Sorry, but it's not my fault this airship's a hunk of junk.
Asami says:  Hang on to something! 
Asami says: Well. They say any landing you could walk away from is a good landing.  But, given our location, I'm not so sure about that.
Korra says: You're the engineer. What do you think? Can we get flying again?
Asami says: It doesn't look good. Even if you metalbend the propellers back into shape, we have to dig this whole thing out of the sand.
Korra says:  Is everyone all right?
Arik says: Like you care.
Kong says: What the heck happened?
Arik says: She said her friend needed help, then they knocked me out!
Korra says: I'm sorry. But I couldn't let you take me to the Earth Queen as a captive. There are dangerous forces at work that you don't know anything about.
Kong says: More dangerous than being stranded in the desert?
Captain says:  Don't worry, Kong. I've radioed Ba Sing Se before we went down. We just need to sit tight. Somebody will be here to rescue us.
Korra says: I'm not waiting around for that. We need to get out of here now.
Asami says: If we all work together, we might be able to get the ship up and running.
Kong says: Not likely. I just tunneled out the engine room. It's like a sandbox in there.
Captain says: This ship isn't going anywhere. And neither are you. You're prisoners and it's our duty to transport you to the Earth Queen.
Korra says:  You realize that I'm the Avatar, right?  You don't want to fight me.
Captain says: I'm afraid you aren't giving us much of a choice. We have our orders.
Asami says:  Wait, did that sand dune just move?
Captain says: It was probably just a mirage. The desert will play tricks on you.
Asami says:  That's no mirage. Look.
Kong says: I heard that since all the spirits came back, this desert has been haunted by them.
Korra says:  Oh right, so I guess that's my fault too. Do you want to help us get this ship up and running, or do you want to wait around and meet that thing?
Kong says: We want to fix the ship. Right, Cap? 
Captain says: Let's get to work.
Korra says: Everybody stand back.
</scene>

Mako says: We have to find a way out of here before Zaheer gets his hands on Korra.
Prisoner says:  Take me with you. I haven't seen my wife and five kids for four years.
Bolin says: Four years?
Prisoner says:  The first few months were great, I-I could finally get some sleep, but ...  now I really miss them.
Mako says:  Listen. Bolin, this is up to you. I know you can metalbend.
Prisoner says: You can metalbend?
Bolin says: No.
Mako says: Yes you can. I believe in you.
Prisoner says: I believe in you too, Bolin.
Bolin says: I appreciate that, Mako, and fellow ... prisoner man. But I've been trying and trying and trying and I've never been able to do it. Not even a little.
Mako says: You've always had the ability deep down. You just haven't had the motivation. But this is your time! Get us out of here to save Korra. You can do it!  Bolin! Bolin!
Other prisoners says: Bolin! Bolin! Bolin! Bolin!
Bolin says: You're right.  Okay, here I go. Metalbending.  I can't metalbend.
Other prisoners says: Aww! 
Prisoner says: Hey, you guys didn't happen to bring any toilet paper, do you?

Lin says: First, you scare the life out of me, now you want to lick me.
Lin says:  Here, chew on this  and leave me alone.  Tonraq, you read me?
Tonraq says: Yes, we copy.
Lin says: I've found Korra's jeep, but the kids aren't here. Meet me at the Misty Palms Oasis.
</scene>

<scene>
Asami says: How's it looking in there?
Korra says: I just airbent all the sand out of the engine room. I think it's clean.
Kong says: Hasn't been this clean since it floated off the showroom floor.
Korra says: How's it going out here?
Asami says: Well, she's still pretty banged up, but I think she might be able to limp out of the desert. Kong, you want to see if you can get the engine started?
Kong says: Aye aye!
Arik says: All right!
Korra says: That's no spirit!  I think it's gone now.
Arik says: Kong, are you all right? What are we going to do? All of our supplies were on the ship. We've got no food, no water.
Captain says: Easy, Arik. Another ship is on the way. We just need to hold our position for a few hours.
Asami says: We might not have a few hours.
Korra says: How far are we from the edge of the desert?
Captain says: Too far to walk, if that's what you're thinking.
Arik says:  We can't just wait around to for that thing to pick us off one by one!
Captain says: You'll do as you're told, Airman. Now get a hold of yourself!
Asami says:  Maybe we can still build something to get us all out of here.
Captain says:  You want to make some wings out of scrap metal and flap real hard?
Asami says: No, but we might have enough material to construct a makeshift sand-sailer. Like the sandbenders use to get around. All we need is a sail and some kind of sled to attach it to.
Korra says: It's worth a try.
Captain says: Gather every piece of metal you can find. We'll give that sandy beast a run for his money yet.

<scene>
Zaheer says: Looks like he's in hurry. Wait here.
Dai Li agent says: Your Majesty, we received a distress signal from the airship carrying the prisoners. We believed the ship crashed in the Si Wong desert and the Avatar may have escaped.
Hou-Ting says:  This is outrageous! Send another airship to retrieve the Avatar immediately.
Dai Li agent says: It's already on its way, Your Majesty.
Ming-Hua says: What are we going to do now?
Ghazan says: There's no way we can track her down in the desert before the queen gets to her.
P'Li says: You really think we'd be lucky enough to capture her again? She'll be long gone by the time they arrive.
Zaheer says: It doesn't matter. We're through chasing her. It's time to make her come to us.
Hou-Ting says: What is this riff-raff doing in my throne room unannounced?
Zaheer says: Apologies, Your Majesty. But I couldn't help overhearing that the Avatar won't be joining us today.
Hou-Ting says: The Avatar is still in my custody. However, eavesdropping on royal conversations will land you in a cell right next to those boys you brought in. Now, if you value your freedom, you'll tell me where the airbenders are right now!
Zaheer says: That wasn't the deal.
Hou-Ting says: I will not bandy words with bounty hunters!  Seize these hoodlums and throw them in prison until they decide to show proper respect for the crown!
Hou-Ting says: Gun! Get in back here and lay down your life for your queen, you coward!  You wouldn't dare attack a queen!
Zaheer says:  Maybe I forgot to mention something to you. I don't believe in queens.  You think freedom is something that you can give or take on a whim ...  To your people ... freedom is just as essential as ... air. And without it ... there is no life.  There is only ... darkness.
</scene>

<scene>
Radio operator says: Hey! You can't be in here!
Zaheer says: No need for alarm. I just need to make an announcement to the entire city. How do I do that?
Radio operator says: Who do you think you are?
Ming-Hua says:  He's the man who just took down the Earth Queen. You want to be next?!
Zaheer says: Ming-Hua, please. We're here to help citizens like him, not hurt them.  Now, can you help me?
Zaheer says: Attention citizens of Ba Sing Se. I have an important announcement to make.  Moments ago, the Earth Queen was brought down by the hands of revolutionaries,  including myself. I'm not going to tell you my name, because my identity is not important.  I'm not here to take over the Earth Kingdom. I think you've had enough of leaders telling you what to do. It's time for you to find your own path. No longer will you be oppressed by tyrants. From now on, you are free!  I deliver Ba Sing Se be into the hands of the people!

Mako says: We have to get out of here, Bolin. Zaheer came here to take out the Earth Queen, and now Korra is next.
Prisoner says: You know that guy? He's my hero!
Mako says: Shut up!  You have to metalbend us out of here. C'mon! I know you can do it! This is your time!
Bolin says: You said before "was my time".
Mako says: I know I did it, but now it's really your time.  Do it!
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: Did you see that? I did it! I mean, not for us, but I metalbent all the other cells open!
Mako says:  I don't think that was you.
Zaheer says: Listen to me. I'm going to set you free, but I want to talk to you first. I have a message that I need you to take to Korra.

Asami says: You want to buy a slightly used sand-sailer?
Captain says: Thanks, Asami. You got a good head on your shoulders.
Korra says: I'm sorry for getting us stranded out there. I didn't mean for that to happen.
Captain says: You know, whatever the conflict between you and the queen is, I'm sure it's above my pay grade.  You've got a tough job. Good luck, Avatar. 
Arik says: Captain, have we been in the desert for too long? Or is that really a dragon over there?
Captain says: Ugh, let's go get a drink.
Korra says: Dhaaah!  Easy, girl. Did you think we weren't coming back to you? 
Korra says:  What are you all doing here?
Tonraq says: Korra, you're safe. 
Korra says: Yeah, we made it out of the desert. Thanks to Asami. 
Tonraq says: Do you remember Lord Zuko?
Zuko says: I met you when you were a very young girl. It's good to see you again, Avatar Korra.
Korra says: It's good to see you, Lord Zuko.
Lin says:  Thanks for ditching me back at Zaofu.
Korra says: Yeah, sorry about that. But, how did you all find us?
Lin says: I am a detective, you know.
Asami says: Did you find Mako and Bolin?
Lin says: Some people at the inn saw them captured by Zaheer's crew. We don't know where they are.
Tonraq says: Did you hear about the Earth Queen?
Korra says: What about her?
Radio says: Once again, the Earth Queen's reign has come to an abrupt and violent end. Ba Sing Se has descended into chaos. Rioters and looters have overrun the palace.
Korra says: The Red Lotus.
Tonraq says: What's that?
Korra says: The name of the group that's been trying to capture me and just took out the Earth Queen. I'm afraid this is only the beginning, Dad.

Bolin says:  Give it back, you dirty thief.
Mako says:  Hey, I stole that fair and square.
Mako says:  Ow, stop it.  Ooof. Okay, you win.
Bolin says:  Your purse, ma'am.
Elderly woman says:  Aren't you a little hero. Here,  let me give you a reward.
Bolin says:  Two yuans?! Seriously?! I risked my life for you,  as far as you know. 
Elderly woman says:  Why, you little hooligan!
Mako says: Nice grab, little brother.
Bolin says:  Thanks.  Bread tastes so much better than what we ate yesterday.
Mako says: We didn't eat yesterday.
Bolin says:  So much better.

Bolin says:  Mako! Do you know who that is? It's Toza, legendary earthbending captain of the Boar-q-pines. He's my hero. What do you think he's doing here?
Mako says: If you'd stop talking, we could hear.
Shady Shin says:  Here's your 10,000 yuans.  Not bad, considering all you have to do is lose your match tonight.  Hey, you're welcome!
Shady Shin says:  Can you believe that ingrate mook?
Bolin says: Wow. I mean, I hate to see Toza lose, even if he needs to.
Mako says: Why? He got paid. You didn't see any pro-benders crying for us when mom and dad died, and we got dumped on the street. Life is hard. You either hustle or get hustled.
Shady Shin says: And speaking of hustling, you two need to hit the bricks and collect enough bets to make this little investment pay off. 'Cause if you don't, you're gonna be right back in the dumpster where I found ya.
Mako says:  Don't worry, bro. We'll do fine. 
Shady Shin says: Seeing those young crooks really gives me hope for the future.

Bolin says:  Mr. Feeeeng! Hey, you wanna bet on the fight tonight?
Mr. Feng says:  Come back here, you little rat weasel!
Mr. Feng says: Oh, thanks for grabbing him, Bolin.  He's been trying to escape ever since he figured out I'm going to feed him to the new pythonaconda I just got in.
Bolin says: What? You're going to turn him into a snake snack?  Wait, I'll buy him. How much?
Mr. Feng says: Five yuans.
Mako says: No, the last thing we need is one more mouth to feed.
Bolin says:  But it's such a tiny mouth!  Pleeeaase? We can't just leave him for snake food! 
Mako says:  Bolin! You have to toughen up!  Big animals eat the little animals, that's just how it goes.  How much do you want to put on the match tonight, Mr. Feng?
Bolin says: Hey! Toza! 
Toza says:  Oh.  You're the kid who works with the Triple Threats.  What, does Shady Shin want me to belly-flop into the pool so I'm extra humiliated tonight?
Bolin says: I just wanted to say, you don't have to throw the fight. I mean ... you're the best!
Toza says:  I was the best. But now my body and my bank account are exactly the same: broke.  I made my decision! Leave me alone!
Mako says: What are you doing? Are you trying to get us in trouble with Shady Shin?
Bolin says: No! I just ... Maybe I'm not as mean as you! Maybe I just can't turn my back on people when they're down!

Bolin says:  Little fire ferret.  Helloo?  I got you buddy. Huh, looks like that snake wasn't hungry after all.  I wonder where he i—
Mako says: You really have a knack for getting into stupid situations, you know that?
Bolin says:  Yeah, thanks Mako.
Mako says: C'mon, we should get out of here.
Bolin says: No, not without him. 
Mako says: All right. But his food comes out of your half.
Bolin says: Hooray! You're with us now, Pabu!
Bolin says: I named him Pabu.
Mako says: How did you come up with that?
Bolin says: I don't know. It just kind of came to me while the snake was strangling me. Oxygen deprivation gives you some good ideas.

Shiro Shinobi says: Wait a second folks.  Toza looks like he's suddenly waking up from a bad dream.  He's blasting away  just like the championship season 10 years ago.  The legend's still got it.  Knockout!
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says:  Yes. He listened to me, Mako. I told him not to throw the fight  and he listened.
Shady Shin says: You what?!
Bolin says: Oh, well, you know, I'm sure there are other factors.
Lightning Bolt Zolt says:  All right, enough, enough.  You look ridiculous, fighting with kids. It's not dignified.  And you; what gives? You cost me a lot of money just now. I thought you were an honorable man.
Toza says: I am an honorable man. I just needed someone  to remind me.  Here's your money back. Now get out of my gym.
Shady Shin says:  Lets go, boys. We're gonna talk about this when we get back to the hideout.
Toza says:  Wait. You guys have got some real bending skills. With a little training, I think you could go pro. I could teach you everything I know.
Shady Shin says:  Sorry bum, but at least one of these kids is too smart to end up like you, right Mako? 
Toza says:  I could find you a place to stay right here in the arena. Who knows, you could be champs. At least it's a chance at an honest living.
Bolin says:  Can we, Mako? Mako, can we please?
Shady Shin says: Don't go soft on me, Mako. Remember, it's up to you to take care of your little brother. Use your head, make the smart play.
Mako says:  Sorry Shady, but you're right. I do have to take care of my brother, and I think this is what's best for him.
Shady Shin says:  Suit yourself. But who knows, maybe we can fix a fight together, some time.
Bolin says: I'm so glad we're not criminals anymore. Lets celebrate over dinner.
Mako says: Err, I think we better save our money.
Bolin says: Oh, I have lots of money coming. I bet everything we had on the Boar-q-pines.
Mako says: What?! But you knew the fight was fixed.

Ikki says:  No fair! You can't go into the Avatar State to win!
Tenzin says:  You did what!?  The Avatar State is not to be used as a booster rocket! You are toying with a dangerous power that you obviously do not appreciate!
Korra says: It's the Avatar State and I'm the Avatar. Who appreciates it more than me?
Tenzin says: Clearly you need more training to grasp the depths of your spiritual connections, not to mention that you're still a long way from mastering airbending.
Korra says:  I have mastered airbending!  Punch punch punch!  See?  Mastered.
</scene>

<scene>
Bumi says:  Looks pretty good to me.
Tenzin says:  Is it too late for you  to unretire from the United Forces?
Bumi says: The paperwork's gone through, little brother. From now on, it's 24/7  Bumi time! 
Tenzin says:  You've mastered Korra style airbending, now you need to master real airbending. Hopefully our visit to all the air temples  will give you the inspiration you need to look more deeply into your studies.
Jinora says:  Can we see where Grandpa Aang was born?
Meelo says: How many lemurs can I have?
Ikki says: I wanna get tattoos! But instead of arrows, I want lightning bolts!
Jinora says: You can't get lightning bolts. That doesn't make any sense.
Ikki says:  You don't make any sense!

Tenzin says:  No one's fighting! We're going to have a wonderful time!  Now that the president is in office and I'm not needed on the council, I can finally relax with my family and give Korra the attention she needs.
Korra says: Great, more attention.
Bumi says: Hah! Relax ... I'd pay money to see that. Maybe I'll tag along just to see "Vacation Tenzin".
Tenzin says: You're not invited.
Korra says:  Before we go on your dad's study trip, we're gonna have some real fun in my home town at the Glacier Spirits Festival. They've got rides, games, and all kinds of fried food on sticks.
Tenzin's children says: Yay!
Bumi says: Yep. There's Vacation Tenzin. And you can't stop me from going to the festival, Mom already invited me.

Mako says:  So I walk up and say: "Looks like you had some car trouble. Good thing the police are here." 
Korra says:  Did you write that beforehand?
Mako says:  Yeah! I had a few others.  Let's see, uh ... "Looks like you guys should put more 'try' in triad", huh? Or, "when you get to jail,  tell 'em Mako sent ya".
Korra says: Ooh, I like that one.
Mako says:  Okay, I'll use that next time. Beifong says if I keep it up, I could make detective soon.
Korra says: That sounds so fun. All I do is train all day. It's like Tenzin's totally forgotten how I beat Amon.
Mako says: Tenzin's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be.
Korra says:  Of course you'd take his side!
Mako says: I'm not taking his side, I'm just ...
Korra says:  I'm gonna take a walk. 
Mako says:  Why is it so much easier to bust triads than it is to get through one conversation with my girlfriend?

Tenzin's children says: Gran Gran!
Katara says: Oh ... you've all gotten so big.
Jinora says: We missed you, Aunt Kya.
Kya says: Ohh, I missed you, too. Your father doesn't bring you to visit nearly enough. He's probably scared I'll beat him up  like when we were kids.
Tenzin says: I'm not scared of you ...  anymore.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  You remember Mako.
Mako says:  Sir.
Tonraq says:  I hope you're not getting my daughter into anymore trouble up in the city.
Mako says: Uh ... No ... uh ... I ... no.
Korra says: Knock it off, Dad.
Bolin says: Wow! Look at all these people that came out to greet us.
Korra says: Uh, no. They came to greet them.
</scene>

<scene>
Tonraq says:  The great chief of the Northern Water Tribe comes to grace us with his  presence. Hooray.
Senna says:  Just relax  Tonraq, he'll be gone  soon enough. 
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: Whoa!  Who are the lovely ladies? 
Korra says: That's Eska  and Desna, the  chief's children. Desna is a guy.
Bolin says:  Oh, no, sure,  I knew that.  Uhhh ...  and which one is Desna?
</scene>

<scene>
Unalaq says:  Good to see you again, Avatar Korra.
Korra says:  Good to see you too.
Unalaq says:  Tonraq.
Tonraq says:  Brother.
</scene>

<scene>
Unalaq says: It's a shame the Southerners have abandoned all connections to the spirits.  Even during the most hallowed times.
Korra says:  I've always loved the Glacier Spirits Festival. It's fun.
Unalaq says:  This festival  used to be a solemn time of fasting  and meditation. Now it's just  a chance to watch some rube try to stick an  entire arctic hen in his mouth.
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: What? Oh, it's so good.
</scene>

<scene>
Tonraq says: Traditions change. It's not the end of the world.
Unalaq says: Tell that to the sailors who are being attacked by angry spirits in southern waters.  Some traditions have  purpose.
Korra says: Wait,  spirits are attacking ships?
Unalaq says:  I'm surprised the Avatar doesn't know about that. Apparently you haven't been given all of the information you need. It would be my honor to instruct you in the spiritual ways of the Water Tribe.
Korra says: I wouldn't mind learning about fighting spirits.  Airbending is getting pretty boring.
Tonraq says: Tenzin is Korra's instructor. He can give her all the training she needs.
Unalaq says:  So you've said.

Asami says: I'm glad you came with me to this meeting. Varrick is one of the richest men in the world, and he controls the entire global shipping business. So, you're my assistant. Just stand there and don't say anything.
Bolin says: No problem, Pabu and I are natural assistants.  Man, this is nice! I got to get into this whole business thing.
</scene>

<scene>
Varrick says: Did ya see that?  Levitation!  I was a foot off the ground!  Is that incredible or what? 
Male guest #1 says: How does he do that?
Male guest #2 says: That's unbelievable.
Male guest #3 says: That's amazing.
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says:  You looked like  you were just sitting on a pillow.
</scene>

<scene>
Varrick says: Are you saying I wasn't levitating?
Bolin says:  Uh ... no?
Varrick says:  Well, why didn't anyone tell me? Now I look like an idiot!  Swami, you're fired!  I like you, kid, you're a real straight shooter, just like me. Miss Sato, he's with you?  Brought your tiger shark with ya to do business, huh? Now that's moxie!  Get over here and pop a squat. Zhu Li, get some tea for my guests!
Asami says: Thank you for meeting with me. As you know, Future Industries is looking for a partner to handle our shipping.
Varrick says: Sure! But first you gotta check out my new venture! Moving pictures! Zhu Li, do the thing!  You're gonna love this!  Mind-blowing, right?
Bolin says:  Yeah.
Varrick says: Now forget that! That's the past! Shut it off, Zhu Li!  Imagine watching this!  Ginger, come over here and do your poses.
</scene>

<scene>
Varrick says: Spectacular! And, we tell a story; there's romance,  action, some funny animal stuff for the kids. You know, whatever! Thanks, Ginger, go rest your gams.  How about that tiger shark? We're gonna do big business with these movers as I call them.
Asami says: Okay ... but I'm just concentrating on getting Future Industries back on track. If we could hammer out a deal ...
Varrick says:  Stop! Look me in the eye.
Varrick says: We got a deal!  We'll hammer out the details at the royal feast tonight.  Now, who wants a rocket boat ride?
Bolin says: Is that how business usually goes?
Asami says:  You are a natural assistant!
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: This is a wonderful feast in your honor, Uncle.
Unalaq says: This is nothing. When this festival was founded, the tribal elders would commune with the spirits. People would watch the brilliant displays of light as spirits danced in the sky.
Korra says: Wow, I've never seen that.
Unalaq says: And that is a shame, since the Avatar is the bridge between the material world and the spirits. That is why I want so badly to teach you. To help you fulfill your destiny.
Tonraq says: I thought I had made it clear that Tenzin is teaching her.
Unalaq says: Every Avatar before you traveled the world to learn. It was Tenzin and your father who kept you secluded at the South Pole.
Korra says: I thought Aang ordered the White Lotus to keep me down here?
Tonraq says: We all did what we thought was best for you.
Korra says:  Who I train with should be my decision, Dad, not yours or Tenzin's.
</scene>

<scene>
Bumi says: Looks like someone's trying to take your place as the Avatar's stick-in-the-mud mentor.
Kya says: Bumi, don't pick on Tenzin. You know he's always been sensitive.
Tenzin says:  I'm not sensitive!
Unalaq says: As your chief, it is my honor to speak at this festival, which was founded to bring our tribes together and restore the ancient balance between our world and that of the spirits. But I am saddened to see what it has become: a cheap carnival that celebrates greedy and trivial humans.  I feel the time is fast approaching when the North can no longer stand idly by while our Southern brothers slip into total spiritual decay. Angry spirits are already attacking ships in your waters. I only hope we are not too late to change course.
Varrick says: Chief Unalaq everybody, always great to have him in town. Now, let's have some fun with Wacky Wushu's Dancing Otter penguins!
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: Wish me luck.  I'm making my move!  Whee!
Mako says: Good luck.
Korra says: Those two have always creeped me out. They smell like a grandma's attic.
Bolin says:  Hey, I'm Bolin. I'm a friend of Korra's! You're, uh, Eska right? Wow, I'm just, I am loving these robes.  So, you are from the north right? Cool, that's, like you know, that's my favorite direction.
Desna says:  I think  he is trying to  establish some kind of bond with you based on your geographic point of origin. 
Eska says:  Perhaps it would be interesting to spend time with a person whose ways are so rough and uncultured.  You amuse me.  I will make you mine.
Bolin says:  You mean like a boyfriend, or like a slave ...?
Eska says: Yes.  Win me prizes.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Unalaq offered to train me. He says he can teach me about the spirits and my connection to them.
Mako says: Sounds good. What does Tenzin think?
Korra says: Tenzin thinks I'm his prisoner or one of his kids. I'll never finish training with him in charge.
</scene>

<scene>
Game guy says: We have a winner!
Korra says:  I mean, you heard what Unalaq said.  The South is spiritually unbalanced and it's the Avatar's job to fix it, but my dad won't even let me think about Unalaq teaching me. Well?
Mako says: Well what?
Korra says: What do you think I should do?
Mako says: I guess you should do what you think is right. I support whatever decision you make.
Korra says:  Oh thanks. That's a big help.
Mako says: I thought you wanted me to be supportive? Now you want me to tell you what I think? Make up your mind!
Korra says: Just forget it.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Uh, Naga what are you doing?  Naga, hush!  Quiet, Naga, you'll wake everyone up! 
Bolin says:  Uh, What's going on?
Korra says: What, is, that?
Bolin says:  Got it!  Don't got it!
Tonraq says:  Korra!
Tenzin says: Spirit, why are you angry with us? What have we done to offend you?
Unalaq says: Go in peace.
Tonraq says: Korra!
Tenzin says: Are you all right?
Korra says:  How are you able to control that spirit when no one else could?
Unalaq says: As your father could tell you, I have spent my life studying the spirits and learning their ways. All of this knowledge is lost in the South, but I could teach you everything I know.
Tenzin says: Chief Unalaq, clearly you are very knowledgeable, but Korra still has much to learn about airbending. And I hope that going to the air temples will help her connect with the past Avatars.
Korra says: Ugh
Unalaq says:  The air temples will teach her nothing. Only I can give her the training she needs to be a complete Avatar.
Tonraq says: I've told you that will not happen!
Korra says: Hey! I'm right here! Anyone want to ask me what I think?
Tenzin says: Korra, please listen.
Korra says: I'm tired of listening to you. Both of you. You keep me locked up, telling me you know what's best. But both of you were powerless against the spirit attack.  I think it's time I had a new teacher.
Tonraq says: Now Korra—
Korra says: Unalaq has proven he's the only one who knows what I need to learn. I have to go with him.
Tenzin says: Please, I know you're angry, but we've come so far together.
Korra says: I'm sorry, Tenzin. This is as far as we go.
Tenzin says:  It has been a pleasure serving you, Avatar Korra.

Katara says: I think you forgot a couple of things. 
Tenzin says: Mother, I think I need some time alone with my family right now. 
Katara says: This is your family, Tenzin.  When you get to be my age, you'll be thankful for the time you had with your siblings. Besides, I think it's important that you all visit your father's home together.
Bumi says:  Come on! It'll be fun.
Kya says: I'm dying to see that laid back, Vacation Tenzin I've heard so much about.
Tenzin says: All right, hop on! I love you, Mom.  We'll see you soon!
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Do you think I did the right thing?
Mako says:  I don't know. I'm sorry, but I'm not very good at this Avatar counseling thing. But I know your heart is in the right place. You'll just have to trust it. .
Unalaq says: I know this was a hard decision, Korra, but it was the right one. Now it is time to put it behind you and begin your new training. I have great plans for you.

Shiro Shinobi says:  After a hundred and seventy years, there are new airbenders in the world and Bumi is one of them! So too is the mysterious Zaheer, who escaped from his prison thanks to his new ability. Now banished from Republic City, Korra made it her mission to find the new airbenders. Will she and Tenzin be able to bring back the Air Nation?
Asami says: Did someone order a fully equipped Future Industries airship?
Korra says: It's perfect! Thanks Asami.
Asami says: I figured if we're going to Ba Sing Se to search for airbenders, we should do it in style.
Meelo says: Yay, airship!
Ikki says:  I wanna see!
Meelo says: C'mon, Poki.
Kya says: While you guys are gone, Pema and I will hold down the fort.
Kya says:  Who's excited to spend some time with your Auntie Kya?
Kya says:  Oh!
Pema says: Aw, he likes you.
Korra says: Mako, I'm so glad you're here.
Mako says: Of course, Korra.  Avatar. Avatar Korra.  Once I received your message I proceeded to contact various locations within the Earth Kingdom as ordered by you, the Avatar.
Korra says:  Right, the Avatar thanks you for your loyal service. Did you find any more leads?
Mako says: There are reports of airbenders popping up all over the Earth Kingdom. I marked the villages on this map.  You guys can take it with you.
Korra says: Actually, I was kind of hoping you could come, too.
Mako says: Really? Uh, it's probably better if I sit this one out.
Korra says: I know things have been weird between us since we broke up, but you're a part of Team Avatar, and we can't do this without you.
Mako says: I'm sorry, I can't.
Pema says:  I'll miss you, sweetie.
Tenzin says: I'll miss you too. Once we find the airbenders, I'll send word. You can join us at the Northern Air Temple then.
Ikki says: Hey! How come Jinora gets to go with you but we don't? That's so not fair!
Meelo says: Yeah! What this girl said! Not fair!
Kya says: Because if airbenders show up here, they're gonna need some guidance from the two of you. It's a very important job.
Ikki says: Really? Me, a teacher?  Yay!
Meelo says: Those maggots will bow to me!
Tenzin says: Go easy on them, son.

Bolin says: Mako, wait a sec.
Mako says:  Korra already asked, bro. I can't just leave Republic City. I have a life here, and a job.
Bolin says: A life? You sleep under your desk. And what's a more important job than helping the Avatar rebuild an entire civilization?
Mako says: It's not just that.  I feel like I've been drifting apart from everyone.
Bolin says: Well, drift back, we need you! C'mon Mako, we're going to Ba Sing Se, where Dad grew up. What if I meet our grandma for the very first time, and she asks me  "Where's your sweet brother?" and I have to say "I'm sorry, Grandma, he had some really important police paperwork to file" and she starts to cry those grandma tears, and is like  "Mako! Why? Why? I can't go on, I ca--"  and then she dies.
Mako says: Okay, all right,  I'll come with you. I guess I gotta call Beifong. She's not going to be happy.

Meelo says: Bye! We'll miss you!

Mako says: As of now, these are the towns where we've gotten reports about airbenders. It looks like we can hit up most of them before we get to Ba Sing Se.
Korra says: We're going to bring the Air Nation back from the brink of extinction after nearly two hundred years.
Tenzin says: And it's all because of you, Korra.

White Lotus sentry says: Finally. Our shift change is here.
White Lotus sentry says: Hey! Where are the other guards?
White Lotus sentry says:  Zaheer?!
Zaheer says: It's nice to see you again, Ghazan.
Ghazan says: Thanks for busting me out. Where did you pick up the new skills?
Zaheer says: I have Harmonic Convergence to thank for that. I was given a gift. I believe it's a sign that our path is a righteous one.

Townsman says: Avatar Korra! Oh it's such an honor to have you come to our humble village.
Korra says: Thanks.
Tenzin says: I hate to get down to business, but is the airbender here now?
Townsman says: Kuon and his family will be joining us shortly for a special dinner. Please, right this way.  Kuon has been the talk of the town ever since he's got airbending; he's like a local celebrity.
Tenzin says: I just want to say it's an honor to meet a fellow airbender.
Kuon says: Oh, I still think of myself as a simple farmer. Who can airbend!  Oh, I'm so sorry! I still don't have any control.
Bolin says: No worries! I love pie. And so does Pabu. 
Tenzin says: Well, you're so much more than just a farmer now. Harmonic Convergence changed everything. You represent the future of a culture that is being reborn. You're going to help us rebuild the Air Nation.
Kuon says: I'm gonna do what now? The only thing I'm planning to rebuild is my barn.
Tenzin says: But you must come with us to the Northern Air Temple.
Kuon says: Well, I can't do that. I have a family and a farm.
Tenzin says: Of course you can come. This is of the utmost importance. Your wife will understand.
Kuon's wife says: Wait, what? No, I do not understand.
Kuon's daughter says: Daddy, where are you going? Why does the bald man want to take you away?
Kuon's wife says: No one's going to take Daddy away, sweetheart.
Korra says: Actually, this bald man does want to take him, but it's for an important cause. Your dad is an airbender, and he should learn about his culture.
Kuon says: I think there's been some sort of misunderstanding. I'm not going with you. I might be able to airbend, but I'm no Air Nomad, I'm no monk.
Townsman says: Okay, maybe we should just have some dessert huh? Who's up for dessert?
Tenzin says: Sir, you must understand, you're an airbender now, and there are thousands of years of culture you must learn about, skills you must master.
Kuon says: You expect me to abandon my entire life? My family?  No! No sir, I'm not going anywhere with you and I think it's best that you leave.

Korra says: In my head, I saw that playing out very differently.
Asami says: Maybe we should have stayed and tried harder to convince him to join us.
Bolin says: Or we could have thrown him in a potato sack and forced him into the ship.
Bumi says:  That's how they got me to join the United Forces.
Tenzin says: No, we can't coerce people, or throw them in potato sacks. They must come freely. But not to worry, there are plenty of other airbenders out there who will be happy to come with us once they find out what the Air Nation is all about.
Tenzin says:  When your son becomes a master, he'll have tattoos all over his body, just like me.  There's nothing more nutritious than our vegetarian diet.  I can tell that you're going to love wearing our ancient airbender robes. They're very breathable.  You'll never have to worry about your worldly possessions again, because you won't have any.  You'll get to shave your head.  Your best friend will be a giant bison! 
Tenzin says: Ugh, I really thought I had that last guy. Who doesn't want a bison as their best friend?
Bumi says: It's okay Tenzin, I still want to be an airbender.
Korra says: Okay, we've tried it your way, and people just don't seem to be responding. It's time for a little tough love.

Ryu's mother says: Oh, are you the Avatar? When my son got airbending, my husband and I were so happy. We thought this could open a lot of doors for him, maybe he could finally move out of the basement. 
Korra says:  How old is he?
Ryu's mother says: He's twenty-two, and you know, still just to figuring his life out.
Korra says: Well, I have a great opportunity for him. We're looking for airbenders to join us at the Northern Air Temple.
Ryu's mother says: Ah, that sounds wonderful! I'll get him.  Ryu! Get up here!
Korra says:  Hi, I'm Korra.
Ryu says: So you're like the Avatar or something. Big deal.
Korra says: Uh, I just wanted to talk to you about an opportunity.
Ryu says: Yeah, I heard you talking to my mom, and I'm not interested. 
Korra says:  Well, you're gonna be interested.
Korra says: You're an airbender now and you have a responsibility as a citizen of the world.
Ryu says: Whatever. I didn't ask to become an airbender, you know.
Korra says:  Well, I didn't ask to be the Avatar, but I am, and I'm fulfilling my duties.
Ryu says: So? You don't have to.
Korra says: Yes, I do have to.
Ryu says: No, you don't.
Korra says: Yes, I do!
Ryu says: No, you don't.
Korra says: Well,  if I didn't embrace my role, then our entire world could be thrown into chaos. Think about that! Is that what you want?
Ryu says: Maybe.
Korra says: No, it's not!
Ryu says: So what? Who cares?
Korra says: Everyone cares!
Ryu says: I don't care.
Korra says:  Yes, you do!
Ryu says: No, I don't.
Korra says: Well, you're about to care, you little slacker, because you're coming with me! 
Ryu says: Stop pulling on my collar! You're stretching it out! Mom, are you just gonna let her take me?!
Ryu's mother says: I think it's a great opportunity. Just try it for a week and see how it goes.
Ryu says: No! Let me go!
Korra says: That's it!
Mako says: Korra, enough! Let's get out of here!
Bolin says: So nice to meet you! Good luck with your son!

Ming-Hua says:  I'm flattered. You busted me out before that girlfriend of yours.
Zaheer says: We're getting her next.

Tenzin says:  Well, I guess we should just go to Ba Sing Se and try our luck there.
Korra says: I don't know what to do. I just thought more people would be excited about coming with us.
Bumi says: Well, maybe you gotta do more to get them excited. You need to add a little razzle-dazzle.
Bolin says: Yeah, razzle-dazzle! We could put on some sort of airbending street performance!
Bumi says: I was gonna say we could cover Tenzin's robe in sequins, but that's even better!
Korra says: It sounds ridiculous, but it might work.
Tenzin says: I'm willing to try anything at this point.
Bolin says: Yes! That is the kind of enthusiasm I like to hear!

Bolin says:  Come one, come all to witness The Amazing Airbenders! The airbending show that will leave you breathless ... with wind! First up, the tattooed master himself, you know him as the son of Avatar Aang, he shaves every hair on his head, every single day!  It's the one, the only guy with an arrow pointing to his nose, Tenzin!
Bolin says: Now, now, ladies and gentleman, ladies and gentleman, please be quiet. I have some serious news. We've heard that an escaped firebending convict has been spotted near here.  Now, I don't want to panic anyone, but if you see a firebender with a red scarf-
</scene>

<scene>
Crowd member says: I see him! He's right there!
Mako says:  I am the escaped convict, and you will all reap my fire.
Bolin says:  Oh no! Who will help us?
Korra says: I will. With my airbending skills!
Mako says:  Ah! Hey! Let me go! This is not what we rehearsed! Korra!
Bolin says: With the power of airbending, even this beast can float!  Like a feather.  Look what can be done in only a few short weeks of practice!
Bolin says: No no, don't worry folks. She might be young, but she is in full control!
Bolin says: Ladies and gentlemen, if you, or anyone you know is an airbender, please, send them our way! Master Tenzin and Avatar Korra would love to teach them all they know!
Kai says: Hey! Hello. If you're looking for airbenders, you just found one.
Kai says: I wanna join you guys.
Bolin says: Get outta town!
Korra says: We got our first recruit.  Just to be totally clear, we're going to be heading to Ba Sing Se, then the Northern Air Temple to live as nomads and rebuild the Air Nation. All that sound good to you?
Kai says: Yeah, Ba Sing Se, rebuild the temple, Air Nomad what-do-you-do, I'm in. Let's go right now.
Bolin says:  This is going to be so great!  You going to love it, er ... ah ... real quick, what's your name?
Kai says: Kai. So when do we hit the road?
Tenzin says: Hang on a second Kai, where are your parents? We can't have you come with us without their permission.
Kai says:  My parents are ... gone. 
Bolin says: You're an orphan?
Kai says: It happened about a year ago. My home town was raided by outlaws, but my parents fought back against them. I was so scared, but they told me not to worry they would protect me, and they did. My parents saved me and the entire village, but they died in the fight. Mum and pap meant everything to me, they're were my whole life.  Ever since then, I've been on the run. Those same outlaws are still after me.
Bolin says: Well, you don't have to be on the run anymore,  right guys? Tell him.
Tenzin says: I'm so sorry about your parents. I know we could never replace them ...  but we are here for you.
Korra says: We'll keep you safe, come on.
Bolin says:  When you board this airship, you're going to leave your old life behind and start a new path. That's big brother advice. Just think of me as your big brother. 
Mako says: Guys! I think we got trouble.
Earth Kingdom sheriff says: Release the boy, or we'll take him by force.
Kai says: The outlaws! They're here ... Uh, let's get out of here. 
Korra says:  We are not running away from anyone.
Korra says:  If you want Kai, you'll have to go through me!
Korra says: Your days of harassing an innocent boy is over. You outlaws are going to prison.
Earth Kingdom sheriff says: Outlaws? Innocent boy? I'm a sheriff  and these are my deputies, and this kid is a thief.  Whatever he told you was a lie, we've been chasing him for months.
Korra says: Where's Kai?
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Right here, I found him slipping away.
Kai says: I was just going to the bathroom.
Mako says: With your stash of gold?
Kai says: I told you, I found this on the road.
Mako says: Enough with the lies kid. I want the truth.
Earth Kingdom sheriff says: The truth is, he's the outlaw. He spent an entire life in an orphanage, got adopted by a real nice family six months ago, and how did he repay them? By taking their entire life savings. We've been after him ever since.
Korra says: Is that true?
Kai says: The person who stole that stuff was the old me. Once I got airbending, I changed. I don't know how to explain it, but I feel like airbending choose me for a reason , like I'm a new person. I'm sorry! Please, you have to listen to me.
Bolin says: Are, are you taking him back to the orphanage?
Earth Kingdom sheriff says: No, he's headed to jail.
Korra says: Wait! You've got the family's life savings, now let us take Kai.
Tenzin says: Do you really want our first member of the Air Nation to be a liar and a thief?
Korra says: He just needs some guidance, Tenzin. Who better to give it to him than us?
Earth Kingdom sheriff says: Do you want this boy or not?
Tenzin says:  Yes, you can release the boy into our custody.
Kai says: Thank you!
Korra says: Don't make me regret it.
Bolin says: Welcome to the family, little bro.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: I just want you to know that I'm going to be watching you, kid. I know exactly what you're all about, 'cause I've been there. You don't have me fooled.
Kai says: Woah! Hey, lighten up.  I'm turning over a new leaf, making a change.  Don't you worry about me.
Jinora says: Hi, I'm Jinora.  If you need any help with airbending, I could show you what I know.
Kai says: Thanks, that's real nice of you. 
Tenzin says:  Jinora, we're leaving now.

White Lotus sentry says: They came out of nowhere.  I'm so sorry, Lord Zuko.
Zuko says: How could you let this happen?
White Lotus sentry says: They caught us by surprise, and Zaheer is an airbender now.
Zuko says:  No! This can't be.  Do you have any idea the power these criminals possess? Individually, they can take down any bender.  Put them all together, they could take down the entire world. And now you're telling me that their leader is an airbender?
White Lotus sentry says: We can track them.
Zuko says: We don't need to track them, I know exactly where they're going.  Notify the new chiefs of the Northern Water Tribe that an attack on their prison is imminent,  and send word to Lin Beifong in Republic City. The Avatar must be protected.
White Lotus sentry says: Where are you going?
Zuko says:  To stop them.

Shiro Shinobi says:  Avatar Korra is back, and yours truly, Shiro Shinobi, couldn't be more thrilled! It's been my honor to bring you news of Korra and her friends over the years; so many heart-pounding moments! Who can forget Amon and his Equalist revolution? I still have nightmares! Then there was the time I covered the Nuktuk mover premiere! Boy, was that fun! But enough about me. Sit back, relax, and take a trip down memory lane!
Wu says: You know, there's something about being kidnapped that makes a guy realize he needs to get his act together.
Mako says: Yeah, I agree. Let's toughen you up.
Wu says:  Daaah, I wasn't ready!  Wu down!
Yin says: What's going on?  Mako, how dare you injure the prince! Would his royal highness like a cherry-berry lemonade?
Wu says: And maybe some of those sticky dumplings, too?
Mako says:  Look at you! You're so weak, "Wu down" is your catchphrase.
Wu says: I know, I'm a wimp. But it's not my fault, I was born that way! I'm not like you Mako, I wasn't raised by a pack of cops in the woods.
Mako says:  You don't know anything about me, do you?
Wu says:  Yeah, I'm drawing a blank. Why is that? How do I not know stuff about you?
Mako says: Uhh ... you never asked?
Wu says: Well, I'm asking now!  What's your favorite food? What's your favorite color? Is there a special lady in your life?
Mako says: Not since Korra and I broke up.
Wu says:  What? You dated the Avatar?  Sit!  You and I need to have a little gab session right now!  How'd you guys first meet?
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Bolin and I were playing for the Fire Ferrets.
Wu says:  You were a pro-bender?
Mako says:  Yes. Will you just let me tell the story?
Wu says:  Carry on.
Mako says: Bolin and I grew up dirt poor, so once I became a pro-bender, I wanted it all: Riches; fame; accolades. But all that changed when I met Korra.
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: Come on, I want you to meet my brother, Mako.
Korra says: Mako? Wow, I-I heard you play on the radio!
Mako says: Come on, Bolin, we're up.
Wu says:  Whoa! That was the first time you met? Kind of rude there, buddy!
Mako says:  You know what else is rude? Interrupting.  Korra proved to be an amazing pro-bender  and a loyal friend. She helped me save Bolin when he was taken by the Equalists.  After going through such a crazy experience, I felt like Korra and I had a powerful connection.
Wu says:  So then you smooched her real good, eh?
Mako says:  Not exactly.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Ahhhh!
Asami Sato says: Oh no! I'm so sorry, I didn't see you!
Mako says: How could you not see me? I mean I was ju-juuuu  I was, I-I, wow.  That was ... 
Wu says:  Wait. That was the first thing you said to Asami? You really gotta work on your introductions.
Mako says:  Hey. When you got charm like mine, you don't need introductions.
Mako says: Hanging out with Asami was awesome. But it made things with Korra  complicated.
Korra says: So, I was thinking we should spend some time together.  Look, I really like you and I think we were meant for each other. 
Mako says: Korra, I'm really sorry, but I just don't feel the same way about you. 
Wu says: That's harsh, Mako.
Mako says: I know.  And the worst part about it is, it wasn't totally true.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: We need to talk.
Korra says: Save your breath. You've already made it clear how you feel about me.
Mako says: No, I haven't. What I'm trying to say is, as much as you drive me crazy, I also think you're pretty amazing. 
Wu says:  Hot dog! Smooch City, here we come. You player.
Tu says:  Whoa. I thought you were dating Asami.
Mako says:  Tu! Get out of here!
Yin says:  Naughty Mako! You take after your grandfather!
Mako says: Guys, Grandma, everything wasn't so cut and dry. I wasn't dating Asami.
Tu says:  Denial.
Mako says:  Okaaay, maybe I was dating her; it was all very confusing.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: But my feelings for Korra became clear when Tarrlok captured her. It felt like a piece of me was gone.
Mako says:  I was so worried. Are you all right?
Korra says: I'm fine. I'm glad you're here.
</scene>

<scene>
Wu says: Hoo! I bet Asami wasn't too happy about that. 
Asami says: I've noticed how you treat Korra, how you acted when she was missing. You have feelings for her, don't you?
Mako says: Things are crazy right now. Can we deal with our relationship problems later?
Asami says: Well, there might not be a relationship to worry about later.
Mako says:  Asami!
Wu says:  Ouch!
Mako says:  Yep. Turns out, she was right. It was time to man up and call it quits.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Asami. I'm sorry things got so messed up between us. But whatever happens today, I want you to know how much I care about you.
Asami says: I care about you, too.
Wu says:  Wait. Was that supposed to be you breaking up with her?
Mako says:  Yes. That was a breakup.
Tu says:  Didn't sound like a breakup.
Mako says:  It was mutual. We had an understanding!  We both knew—  Can I just get on with the rest of my story or what?
Wu says: Fine.  But I hope you weren't as ambiguous with Korra as you were with Asami.
Mako says: Trust me, I wasn't.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Korra and I ended up stopping Amon together and after that, I was finally able to tell her how I felt. Exactly how I felt.
Mako says: I love you, Korra.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: I love you, too.
Yin says:  Awww. And then you two lived happily ever after?
Mako says:  Ummmm ...
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Tenzin's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be.
Korra says: Of course you take his side.
Mako says: I'm not taking his side.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: You know, sometimes I wonder whose side you're on.
Mako says: There aren't any sides!
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: How could you take his side?
Mako says: What's with you and sides?
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  Well, excuse me, officer! Don't let me stand in the way of you writing tickets! I'm just trying to save the world!
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Well, I guess if we're both putting our jobs first, maybe there's no room for our relationship!
Korra says: So, what? Are you ... breaking up with me?
Mako says: Yeah ... I guess I am.
Wu says:  Now that's a breakup!
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: After that, I dove into my work. Someone had been taking out supply ships heading to the Southern Water Tribe.  Asami's company was one of the victims, so she and I worked together to catch the perps.  The stakeout was the perfect way to get my mind off Korra. It was an intense night.  Asami and I discovered the triads had double-crossed us. We barely got away, but by then, Asami's warehouse had been cleared out.
</scene>

<scene>
Asami says: My company ... it's over ... I give up.
Mako says: Well ... I'm not giving up on you.
Mako says:  I know, I know, don't tell me ... I had no right kissing Asami.
Wu says:  No, actually, I'm completely fine with that. You officially broke up with Korra and therefore, you're free to smooch whoever you wish.
Mako says:  If only it had been that simple.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Mako, I missed you so much!
Mako says: Korra ... hey, I-I missed you, too.  So you're not still mad at me? We had that fight before you left, remember?
Korra says: Not really. I got attacked by a dark spirit and I lost my memory for a little while. Maybe it hasn't all come back yet. Was it a bad fight?
Mako says: Ahhhhh ...  Hmmmm, no. No. It-it wasn't that bad.
Wu says:  Whoa, whoa, whoa! So you were back with Asami, but then Korra came back and thought you guys were still together and you didn't tell her you weren't?
Yin says:  Just like your grandfather.
Mako says:  Well, me and Asami were never officially back together.
Tu says:  Really? That again? You know, it seems like you're so afraid to disappoint anyone that you end up disappointing everyone.
Wu says:  Truer words have never been spoken.  High-five! 
Mako says: Well, eventually, I did tell Korra. But by then, she already knew.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Why didn't you just tell me the truth in the first place?
Mako says: I know I should have, but ... I didn't want to hurt you all over again. I guess part of me wanted to forget about the breakup, too.
Korra says: I think we both know that this ... us ... doesn't work.
Mako says: You're right.
Korra says: It's ... over. For real this time.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: After Harmonic Convergence, the world changed. Team Avatar traveled around, searching for new airbenders. At first, it was awkward being around Korra and Asami.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says:  As you were.  Ladies.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: But then I realized I had to figure out who I was without a lady in my life.
Wu says: I know what that's like.
</scene>

<scene>
Wu says: I mean, to need distance from women.  Because I have so many, all over me, all the time.
Mako says:  Anyway,  I eventually helped Korra defeat Zaheer and save the airbenders.  And we did it as friends. Korra showed me the importance of putting others before myself  and whenever I think of her, she continues to inspire me.
</scene>

<scene>
Wu says: Wow! That story is amazing and I really learned something!
Mako says: You did? Good. 
Wu says: Yeah! I learned that I really didn't know anything about you! Crazy!  Also, I realized that ladies are complicated. No offense, Grandma.
Yin says: None taken.
Wu says: I better just focus on being a better king.  Okay, come at me. I can take it.
Wu says: Aahhhhh! Wu down!
Asami says: I brought you some tea.  I thought you might be cold out here.
Korra says: You're so sweet.  Thanks. 
Asami says: Are you okay? You seem out of sorts.
Korra says: Sorry. I've just been thinking about something Toph said. She told me that the world doesn't need me and it's basically pointless to try and stop Kuvira.
Asami says: That's ridiculous.
Korra says: At the time, I thought so, too. I figured she was just being her normal, cranky self. But I'm beginning to think she had a point.
Asami says: No, she doesn't. The world does need you. You're the Avatar.
Korra says: But no matter what I do, the world seems to always be out of balance!  Growing up, I couldn't wait to be the Avatar. I thought I was really gonna change things. I was so naive.  The first time I saw Amon take someone's bending away, I was terrified.
Amon says: Your firebending is gone! Forever.
Korra says:  Then my worst nightmare came true.
Mako says: Korra!
Korra says:  No!
Amon says: I told you I would destroy you.
Asami says:  Korra, you're forgetting about all the good that happened after you exposed Amon as the fraud he was. The Equalist Movement lost its leader and its power.  Free elections were held in the United Republic and nonbenders finally had a voice.  People had hope again and it was all because of you.
Korra says: And I was hopeful, too. That feeling didn't last long.  As soon as I defeated Amon, a new enemy took his place.  I can't believe I trusted you. You made me think you wanted to restore balance with the spirits, but this, this isn't balance, it's madness! Now let her go!
Unalaq says: If you want your friend to make it out of the Spirit World, you'll open the other portal now.
Korra says:  Because of Unalaq, I betrayed Tenzin, opened the portals, and threw the Spirit and human worlds into chaos.  It was my fault he fused with Vaatu and became a Dark Avatar.  And I was helpless to stop him from destroying Raava and cutting off my connection to my past lives.  With Raava gone, Unalaq and Vaatu became more powerful than ever. 
Asami says:  But you became more powerful, too. I mean ... you turned into a giant spirit.
Korra says: Yeah ... that was pretty awesome.
Asami says:  And opening the spirit portals turned out to be a good thing.  You brought back the airbenders and caused a positive shift in the world.
Korra says: Yes,  but Zaheer got airbending too and nearly killed me.  If it weren't for Zaheer,  the Earth Queen would still be alive. There would have been no crisis in the Earth Kingdom  and Kuvira wouldn't be in power.  Things are more out of balance than ever now. Nothing's changed!
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says: You're right, Korra.
Korra says: I am?
Asami says: She is?
Tenzin says: It's true, there will always be new conflicts and enemies to face. But the important thing is to learn from your enemies and better yourself over time, which you have.  You've changed so much since you first arrived on Air Temple Island. When you first came here, you were hot-headed and a bit selfish.  But you've matured into a thoughtful young woman who puts the needs of others before herself.  The new Air Nation is a testament to that. You sacrificed everything to save them. You're an inspiration to the world.
Korra says:  Thank you both. I know this Kuvira problem is only going to get worse. But no matter what happens, no matter how crazy things get, I'll always try to restore balance. 
Baraz says:  And that's when I made a solemn vow never to eat bark-onion soup again.  Been six years, four months and fourteen days ...  Urgh!  I can still taste it. 
Bolin says:  Does anyone else feel like throwing themselves overboard?
Varrick says:  Not me!  I've spent the last few hours tuning out all these incredibly boring stories ...
Baraz says:  Hey!
Varrick says:  All the while  mentally composing the most exciting tale  ever told, soon to become the greatest  mover  ever made!  I present to you now:  Bolin,  as Nuktuk, Hero of the South—  Trademark Varrimovers International—  in  the incredible true story of Bolin! Hero of the world!
Bolin says:  Wait, am I playing Nuktuk, or is Nuktuk playing me?
Varrick says:  Both. It's your true story, but we'll capitalize on the  audience of the Nuktuk franchise.  Duh!
Bolin says:  How can you call me "the hero of the world"?  I left my friends and family to join up with a psychotic dictator who imprisoned me and now,  I'm running back home with my tail between my legs.
Varrick says: Nyahbabababab! You're emphasizing the wrong story beads. Let me tell it. The story of Bolin begins in an exotic port of call.  A wise sage, the richest merchant in the world, and a handsome devil all  sit on a single pillow in the living room of a luxury yacht! How do they all fit on one pillow?
Bolin says:  Ooh! Giant pillow!
Varrick says: Wrong! They're all the same man! Me!  I try to teach a swami the power of levitation, but he's too stupid  to understand it, so I kick him out.  "Upon whom can I bestow my awesome knowledge?" I ask myself. Then, in walks Nuktuk, with a twinkle in his eye, a gorgeous dame on his arm, and a song on his lips. He bursts into a rapturous melody!  "Where can I find my teacher?" 
Bolin says: Oh, come on! I wasn't singing, you were not levitating, and Asami is just a friend, thank you very much.  If you want to tell my true story, you should start from when I met Korra. She came to the bending arena, one fateful night ...
Korra says: This place is even more amazing than I imagined!
Bolin says: Name's Bolin, by the way.
Korra says: Korra. 
Baraz says:  Bo-ring!  When does the singing start?
Bolin says:  There wasn't any singing!
Varrick says: You're on-screen talent, kid. Leave the storytelling to the masters.  So, the trouble begins when the Avatar is trapped in the Spirit World. The world's most evil villains realize that with Korra out of the way, the time is right to try to take out Bolin.  So, the worst of the worst team up. They're led by ... Zaheer, leader of the Red Lotus and master of the skies, a flying chaotic chaos machine!  He's joined by ... Vaatu, the ultimate force of pure spirit evil in the universe. The biggest, meanest, scariest kite that ever flew! 
Bolin says:  Wait! Zaheer didn't team up with Vaatu. How would that even happen?
Varrick says:  How do you think?
</scene>

<scene>
Vaatu says: Hello?
Zaheer says: Hey. It's Zaheer.
Vaatu says: Oh. Hey, Zaheer.
Zaheer says:  Glad I caught you at home. 
Vaatu says:  Uh-huh. Very funny. Like I can leave this stupid tree.
Zaheer says: Hold on, let me conference in—
</scene>

<scene>
Varrick says: Amon! The reanimated  zombie body  of the bloodbending leader of the Equalists! 
Amon says:  Hey, guys, I'm totally in for taking out Bolin. He's way too powerful and awesome. But can we please not include—
Unalaq says: Not include who, Amon?
Varrick says:  The evil Unalaq. The diabolical but incredibly boring and unpopular sorcerer from the north, who's listening in on the other line!
Unalaq says:  I've spent my life trying to defeat Nuktuk, I mean, Bolin, and I know just where to find him: With all the beautiful ladies!
</scene>

<scene>
Varrick says: Yes, Bolin had a reputation as the world's greatest ladies' man.
Bolin says: Oooh, now the story's getting interesting.
Varrick says: After leaving the beautiful but emotionally unstable Water Tribe princess at the altar,  he met a fetching airbender, the heir to a vast Earth Kingdom fortune! 
Bolin says:  Opal, so smart and caring, so pretty to smell,  and she'll probably never talk to me again because I'm so stupid! Stupid! So, so, so  stupid. 
Varrick says:  Pull it together, you leaky lug.  But the darkest moment is always right before the dawn! For at his lowest point, Bolin sought advice from the man who started it all, the wisest of the wise—Me!—for some of my signature sage advice!  Nuktuk, I mean, Bolin, there's only one thing for you to do if you want to save the Avatar and defeat the "Fearsome Foursome"  —I'm not really sure if I like "Fearsome", I mean, "Evil Squared" might be better. Whatever— You have to assemble the fighting-est airbender army of all time! But it turns out the airbender recruits are a sorry lot,  so Bolin brings them to a secret mountaintop training facility, where he teaches them the ancient art of dodging fruit and balancing on sticks! Meanwhile, back with Zombie Amon ...
</scene>

<scene>
Amon says: Okay, guys, I think we finally ditched him.
Unalaq says:  Haha, very funny, I'm still on the line. So, about that evil plan to destroy Nuktuk.
Unalaq says:  Hello? Anyone there?  Guys!
</scene>

<scene>
Varrick says: And with danger closing in, Opal realizes how much she loves Bolin and forgives him for whatever stuff he was talking about earlier, which will probably not be in the final cut of the mover anyway.
Bolin says:  She does?
All refugees says: Awww!
Varrick says: And she kisses Bolin, magically passing on the airbender power of flight!
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: Okay, that part seems a little unbelievable.
Varrick says:  This is no time for thinking, kid! We're heading into the big finale!  Bolin gathers his airbender army to fight alongside Rotan and Juji against the Terror Square!  Maybe that's the name of the bad guys, "Terror Square"!  What about "Legion of Darkness"? Well, we'll put a focus group on it.  Bolin teaches the airbenders to create a giant tornado.  Then he flies around in the sky,  pushes Zaheer into it,  turning him into wind, forever! But Bolin doesn't realize that the Universal Interplanetary Combination Zero-Hour—talk about a ticking clock—is almost upon him!  And when Juji shoots his laser eyes at the evil Unalaq,  the beams accidentally fly into the magic spirit doorway!  They bounce off Vaatu, setting him free,  and hit Bolin, turning him into a giant!  But when Vaatu is set free, the evil Unalaq, who has always been an annoyingly clingy person, is so close to Vaatu that they combine into one horrifying monster!  Giant Bolin and the evil UnaVaatu fight toe-to-toe, zapping each other with their laser beams as they stomp around Republic City!  It looks like the evil UnaVaatu might win!  But thankfully, Bolin's spiritual mojo is so strong that he attracts the queen of the fairies!  With her help, Bolin turns UnaVaatu into magic dust and sprays him into the sky.  And that's where the stars come from.  Oh yeah, and he turns into a dragon and he goes into the Spirit World and he saves the Avatar.  The end!
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says:  Wait! You like that?  It didn't make any sense! What about Zombie Amon? What happened to him, huh? And-and-and-and stars are magic fairy dust?  Are you guys crazy?  Are you crazy?
Baraz says:  It's just a mover.  Don't over-think it. It's like a ride.
Varrick says:  Never let the truth get in the way of a good story, kid!

Shiro Shinobi says:  After a close encounter with Amon, Korra took a leave of absence from Tarrlok's task force. But the Avatar has still been hard at work, leading the underdog Fire Ferrets to the pro-bending championship finals. Only one team stands in their way: the Wolfbats! Led by team captain Tahno, the brutal Wolfbats look to repeat as champs. Have the Fire Ferrets finally met their match?
</scene>

Radio host says:  You're listening to "The Music Hour"!  Brought to you by Cabbage Corp,  Republic City's trusted name in technology for over fifty years.
Korra says:  Man, I got a good feeling about tonight. I don't care if we are the underdogs. We can take those pompous Wolfbats.
Mako says:  It's going to be our toughest match ever, but I think you're right.
Bolin says:  Introducing your new champs, the fantastic Fire Ferrets!
Amon says: Good morning, citizens of Republic City. This is Amon.  I hope you all enjoyed last night's pro-bending match, because it will be the last.  It's time for this city to stop worshiping bending athletes as if they were heroes. I am calling on the council to shut down the bending arena  and cancel the finals, or else there will be severe consequences.
Bolin says: That guy's got some nerve.
Mako says: You think the council will give in?
Korra says: I'm not waiting to find out. We need to get to City Hall.
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says:  Korra, you shouldn't be here. This is a closed meeting.
Korra says: As the Avatar and a pro-bending player, I have a right to be heard. You can't cancel the finals.
Tenzin says: I know winning the championship means a lot to you. But as far as I'm concerned, we need to shut the arena down.
Korra says: What about the rest of you? Tarrlok, there's no way you're backing down from Amon, right?
Tarrlok says: Actually,  Tenzin and I agree for once.
Tenzin says: The council is unanimous. We're closing the arena.
Mako says: No!
Bolin says: You can't!
Korra says:  I-I don't understand. I thought you, of all people, would take a stand against Amon.
Tarrlok says: While I am still committed to bringing that lunatic to justice, I will not put innocent lives at stake just so you and your friends can play a game.
Mako says:  Pro-bending might only be a game to you, but think of what it means to the city! Right now the arena is the one place where benders and nonbenders gather together ... in-in peace! To watch benders ...
Bolin says: Beat each other up! In peace!  It's an inspiration to everyone!
Tarrlok says: I appreciate your naive idealism, but you're ignoring the reality of the situation.
Korra says: The reality is if you close the arena, you let Amon win!
Bolin says:  Yes, exactly what she said! Yes!
Tarrlok says: I'm sorry, but our decision has been made. This meeting is adjourned.

Lin says: I can't believe I'm saying this, but I agree with the Avatar.
Tarrlok says: You do?
Korra says: Yeah, you do?
Lin says: I expected this kind of cut-and-run response from Tenzin.  But the rest of you? Come on, show a little more backbone. It's time that the benders of this city displayed some strength and unity against these Equalists.
Tenzin says:  We must prevent the conflict between benders and nonbenders from escalating into all-out war!  The council is not changing its position, Lin.
Tarrlok says: Now just a moment, Tenzin. Let us hear what our esteemed Chief of Police has in mind. 
Lin says: If you keep the arena open, my metalbenders and I will provide extra security during the championship match. There's no better force to deal with the chi blockers. Our armor is impervious to their attacks.
Tarrlok says: Are you saying that you will personally take responsibility for the safety of the spectators in the arena? 
Lin says:  I guarantee it.
Tarrlok says:  It is hard to argue with Chief Beifong's track record.  If she is confident her elite officers can protect the arena, then she has my support. I am changing my vote.  Who else is with me?  The arena stays open. Good luck in the finals.
Bolin says: All right!
Mako says:  Yeah!
Korra says:  Thank you!
Tarrlok says: And good luck to you, Chief Beifong.
Tenzin says: A word please, Lin.

<scene>
Tenzin says: Tarrlok's playing you and I don't want to see you get hurt.
Lin says: I know what I am doing and the risks that come with it.
Tenzin says: In that case, I'm going to be by your side during the match.
Lin says:  You don't need to babysit me.
Tenzin says: It's for Korra. I want to make sure she's safe.
Lin says:  Do what you want! It's not like I've ever been able to stop you before.
Korra says:  Excuse me, Chief Beifong. I wanted to thank you for your help,  it ... really ... means a lot ...  What is her deal? Even when she's on my side, she's against me!
Tenzin says: I've known Lin since we were children, she's always been ...  challenging.
Korra says: What did your father do to make her hate the Avatar so much?
Tenzin says: My father and Lin got along famously.  I'm afraid her issues ... are with me.
Korra says:  Wait a second ...  it all makes sense now!  You and Beifong, Beifong and you. You two were a  couple!
Tenzin says:  What! How-?  Where'd you get that idea?
Korra says: Ha!  Your wife.
Tenzin says:  Criminy! I'll have to have a word with her.
Korra says:  So ... Pema stole you from Beifong. I'm surprised our "esteemed Chief of Police" didn't throw her in jail.
Tenzin says:  Oh, she tried.  Anyway, Pema didn't steal me, Lin and I had been growing apart for some time. We both had different goals in li-  Why am I even telling you this? It all happened a long time ago and we've moved passed it.
Korra says: Hm, apparently Beifong hasn't.
Tenzin says: What do you ...  Of course she has! Anyway, this is none of your business! 
Korra says:  See you at home, Mr. Heartbreaker!

Lin says:  I have the skies, the bay, and every nook and cranny of this place covered.  Now leave me alone and let me do my job.
Tenzin says:  Lin, with so much on the line it would be nice if we could help each other out, at least for one night.
Lin says:  Like old times?
Tenzin says: Like old times.
Lin says:  Okay, I'll try to be less abrasive than usual.
Tenzin says: I would appreciate that.

Shiro Shinobi says:  The anticipation is palpable as we are just moments away from the championship match.  Will the Wolfbats' ferocity help them repeat as champs?  Or will the underdog Fire Ferrets serve up a surprising bowl of smackdown soup?
Bolin says:  Now I know there's a big crowd but don't be nervous. You're gonna do great, I believe in you. 
Ring announcer says: Introducing the challengers, the Future Industries Fire Ferrets!
Bolin says:  You're on, Pabu.
Bolin says: Yes! Nailed it!  He's so talented!
Ring announcer says: And their opponents, the three timed defending champions, the White Falls Wolfbats!
Bolin says: Pfft,  they got nothing on us, buddy. Anybody can howl.  Hm, whatever.
Korra says:  I'm gonna knock Tahno's stupid hair off his stupid head!
Shiro Shinobi says: The champs and challengers face off at the center-line and here we go! 
Shiro Shinobi says: Tahno tries to clean the Avatar's clock with some dirty water boxing.  Ming shakes off Mako's attack and returns the favor.  Shaozu gets fancy, but Bolin ricochets a disk off the ropes and says 'No, thank you sir!'
Mako says:  Nice shot!
Shiro Shinobi says: The waterbenders slug it out, looking evenly matched.  Tahno gets a little too worked up and unleashes a deluge on Bolin that would certainly elicit a foul.  Or apparently not.
Mako says:  What's the big idea, ref? That was a hosing foul! 
Shiro Shinobi says: And the Wolfbats advance despite Tahno exceeding the waterbending time limit.  A questionable call by the officials.  Ming trips up Mako with another dirty trick!
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says:  Oh come on, refs! There was some funny business in that last play!
Lin says:  Wouldn't have guessed you knew the rules of pro-bending?
Tenzin says:  I've been brushing up. That Wolfbat blatantly bent a disk outside of his zone.
</scene>

<scene>
Shiro Shinobi says: The Ferret brothers are backed up to zone three and the Wolfbats smell blood.  Looks like Tahno snuck in an illegal icing move but once again there's no call.  I don't know what match the refs are watching but it's obviously not this one.  Oh ... a splash-and-clash sends the Avatar to zone three as well.  It's a knockout! The Wolfbats win the championship for the fourth year in a-  Hold on a second, folks!  Scratch that! The Ferrets are still alive, but just barely.  What an unbelievable move! These Ferrets aren't just bending the elements, they're bending my mind!  The underdogs survive to see round two.
Korra says: What's wrong with these refs?
Mako says: They've been paid off; it's the only explanation.  Someone wants us to lose.
Korra says:  If the Wolfbats are gonna fight dirty,  then so should we.
Mako says: No we can't!  The refs have it out for us. If we're gonna win this thing, it has to be fair and square.
Korra says:  Argh, that's no fun but ... all right.
Ring announcer says: Round two! 
Shiro Shinobi says:  The opening salvo is a brutal call as both sides give it their all.  But once again, Tahno sneaks in a little ice to get the upper hand.  Wowzers! Those look like illegal head shots to me! 
Ring announcer says: Round two will be decided with a tie-breaker!
</scene>

<scene>
Referee says:  The Fire Ferrets win the coin toss. Which element do you choose?
Korra says:  I'm taking this one. Let's go!  You and me, pretty boy!
Tahno says:  Thought you'd never ask.
Tahno says:  Come on, little girl. Give me your best shot.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  Hmph, chump.
</scene>

<scene>
Ring announcer says: Round two goes to the Fire Ferrets! 
Mako says:  Nice one!
Bolin says: That's the stuff. You are my herooo-ah!
Mako says:  We might actually win this thing!
</scene>

<scene>
Tahno says:  Let's send them to a watery grave!
</scene>

<scene>
Lin says:  I can't believe your sweet-tempered father was reincarnated into that girl. She's tough as nails.
Tenzin says:  Reminds me of someone else I knew at that age. You two might get along if you would only give her a chance.
Lin says:  Hmph.
</scene>

<scene>
Shiro Shinobi says: One round apiece:  who wants it more?  The Wolfbats fly out of the gates, swinging with bad intentions.  The challengers are showing a lot of heart but the champs are really starting to find their rhythm now.  Can the Ferrets hang in there with the best,  especially when the best are frankly getting a little help from the refs?  It's all down to this final round!  Mako is leaving it all in the ring  but it looks like Tahno and Ming are up to more shenanigans!  Oh, this has gone too far!  That water had rocks in it!
Referee says:  Knockout!
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says:  Oh, come on! Those were illegal head shots! Open your eyes, ref!
Shiro Shinobi says:  Well, folks it's a controversial call but the Wolfbats notch a nasty knockout to win the match!  For the fourth year in a row, they'll be crowned tournament champions.
Tahno says:  I barely broke a sweat! Anybody else wanna scrap with the champs?
</scene>

Tenzin says: Look out!

Shiro Shinobi says: Folks, there is some sort of electrical disturbance in the stands. Metalbender cops are dropping like bumbleflies. There appear to be masked members of the audience wielding strange devices on their hands.  One of them is in the booth with me right now, folks! He is leveling one of those glove devices at me now and I believe he is about to electrocute me. I am currently wetting my pants.

Tahno says:  What's going on here, ref?
Referee says:  I don't know!
</scene>

Tahno says:  All right, you want a piece of the Wolfbats? Here it comes!
</scene>

Tahno says:  Wait, please don't do this!  I'll give you the championship pot,  I'll-I'll give you everything just  please don't take my bending!

Amon says: I believe I have your attention, benders of Republic City.  So once again, the Wolfbats are your pro-bending champions.  It seems fitting that you celebrate three bullies who cheated their way to victory because every day,  you threaten and abuse your fellow nonbending citizens  just like the Wolfbats did to their opponents tonight.  Those men were supposedly the best in the bending world and yet it only took a few moments for me to  cleanse them of their impurity. Let this be a warning to all of you benders out there:  if any of you stand in my way,  you will meet the same fate.  Now, to my followers: for years the Equalists have been forced to hide in the shadows, but now we have the numbers and the strength to create a new Republic City.  I'm happy to tell you that the  time for change has finally come. Very soon, the current tyrannical bending regime will be replaced by a fair-minded Equalist government. You and your children will no longer have to walk the streets afraid! It's time to take back our city.
Mako says: How are we gonna get out of here?
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: Pabu! Listen up, buddy. 
Mako says:  Stop fooling around!
Bolin says: I'm not! I'm trying to save us!  See? Pabu's not just a one trick poodle pony. 
Amon says:  For centuries, benders have possessed an unnatural advantage over ordinary people.  But thankfully, modern technology has provided us with a way to even out the playing field.  Now anyone can hold the power of a chi blocker in their hand.  My followers and I will not rest until the entire city achieves equality, and once that goal is achieved, we will equalize the rest of the world.  The revolution has begun! 
</scene>

Lin says:  Tenzin!

Bolin says:  Me too!

Kuvira says: No. The eyes of the world are on us now. We must do this right. That's why we need Bolin.

Korra says:  If Kuvira's heading to Zaofu, so am I. She needs to know that the Avatar is back.  The world needs to know.
Meelo says: Woo-hoo! Avatar fight! This is going to be awesome!
Korra says:  Meelo, there's not gonna be a fight. Kuvira saved my dad. She was a captain in Su's guard; I think she can be reasoned with.

Varrick says:  In this stasis capsule is a preserved spirit vine sample weighing approximately two "Zhu Lis".
</scene>

<scene>
Varrick says: I have postulated that these spirit vines are a form of pure energy that's unstable in what we call--  --"typical earth conditions".  This machine should transfer the energy from the vine into a battery using electrical currents, reverse magnetic polarity, and a little-known phenomenon I like to call--  --the Varri-Effect!

Varrick says:  It's working! It's registering five "Varricks" of power.  Now seven Varricks!

Zhu Li says:  I think you're just weak, sir! Pull harder!
Zhu Li says:  Varrick ... you saved me.
Varrick says:  Of course I saved you.
Varrick says: I can't clean this place up by myself!  Grab a broom!
Kuvira says: What happened? Were we attacked?
Varrick says:  No! We were spirit-vined! But don't worry! I'm putting the kibosh on this project.
Kuvira says: No, you're not. Do you realize what we could do with this kind of power?
Varrick says:  Yes! I do! And that's why we gotta put an end to it! What if it fell into the wrong hands?
Baatar Jr. says:  Since when does that matter to you?
Varrick says:  I know, it's not like me, right? Usually I look at a project like this and think, "Wow! I could make a ton of money off this!" But recently, I've been having these strange feelings ... inside.  It's like I'm ... concerned with others. And there's this nagging voice in my head constantly telling me what's right from wrong!
Zhu Li says:  I believe that voice is your conscience, sir.
Kuvira says:  Well, I'm the other voice in your head, and I'm telling you you will continue with this project.
Varrick says: Sorry, no. I just really gotta stand my ground on this one-- Whoa!
Kuvira says: And now there's a voice in my head telling me to drop you on the tracks.  Should I listen?
Varrick says:  No! No! Head voices are liars, what do head voices know? I'll work on the project! Please don't drop me!

Hiroshi says: I can't forgive myself for all the horrible things I've done. And I never expect you to forgive me. I tore our family apart, and destroyed our good name.  But in a life of regret, you're the one thing I look back on that makes me smile.  I just want you to know I'm so proud of you, Asami. You are the greatest thing I ever created.

Bolin says: Am ... I in trouble?
Kuvira says: No. In fact, I have good news. We want you to be a part of our inner circle.
Bolin says:  Inner circle? No way! Yes!  That is a great honor. What does it mean, exactly?
Kuvira says: It means you've proven your worth. We're so close to uniting the Empire, but Su has some resentment towards me and Baatar that might cloud her judgment and stop her from making a wise decision. We believe you can help her see clearly.
Bolin says:  I can do that! By the time I'm finished telling her all the great things we've done, she'll be begging to join!
Kuvira says: Good. Because we're here.
Bolin says: Aren't all these troops gonna send the wrong message?
Kuvira says: The army is here to project strength. You're here to present peace.
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says:  Opal! You're here, too! 
Opal says:  No! You've chosen your side.
Bolin says: Sides? There shouldn't be sides!  I know, why don't we all stand in a circle, huh? Maybe hold hands?
Suyin says:  I'm not giving up Zaofu. I don't care if you brought your entire army.
Kuvira says: Su, I didn't bring my army to threaten you. I wanted to show you all that your son and I have accomplished.
Suyin says:  You must realize what you're doing goes against everything your father and I tried to teach you.
Baatar says: Son, you belong here.
Baatar Jr. says:  Why? So that I could go on living in your shadow?
</scene>

<scene>
Suyin says: Don't say that! Can't you see she's brainwashed you!
Kuvira says:  Ha! I didn't brainwash him! I set him free! And now he's accomplished more with me than he ever could with you.
Bolin says:  Okay, guys, obviously, there's a lot of personal, painful history here, so what do you say we just all forget about that stuff, huh? I mean, that's the past!  Right Wing? Right Wei? You guys know what I'm talkin' 'bout, right? High five!  All right. No, that's cool.  You know what I think we need to do? Focus on the future! And the future is bright, let me tell you!  I've seen it! Yeah!  Saw it last month! We went to this town that had nothing. Most of the people there had never seen a Satomobile before. Now, they have two Satomobiles, running water, and a magnet train that goes right through their town! I mean, how awesome is that?
Opal says: They might have been happy when you first arrived, but I've seen what happens after you leave. Citizens are forced to work as slave labor, dissenters are sent off to who-knows-where!
Bolin says: You're wrong, Opal! Now, I don't know what you think you've seen, but I am giving you the one-hundred-percent Bolin guarantee that we're making the Earth Empire a better place to live!
Suyin says:  I can't believe you brought Bolin here to try and sway us. Leave! Zaofu will never accept you as their leader!
Kuvira says:  Then you leave me no choice. You have twenty-four hours to agree to join the Empire, or we take the city by force.
</scene>

Meelo says: I see it! Zaofu! We made it!  And a bunch of other people are here, too.
Korra says:  Oh, no. I hope we're not too late.

Suyin says: Korra? I can't believe it, where have you been?  You disappeared; everyone was so worried!
Korra says: I'll tell you the whole story later. Right now, I want to help you stop Kuvira. What can I do?
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: You were just bluffing, right? I mean, you're not really gonna attack Zaofu ... are you?
Kuvira says: When people don't cooperate, we must find other ways of convincing them to join.
Bolin says:  Other ... ways? How many ... times have we used these "other ways" in the past?
Kuvira says:  It's not for you to worry about.
Bolin says: So, uh ... what does happen to all those towns and villages after we leave? I just realized I'd never really ... gone back and ... checked on them.
Kuvira says:  Those people are my loyal subjects, and they contribute to the Empire however I see fit. Now that you're in the inner circle, you're going to have to accept some hard truths.
Bolin says: Maybe ... I'm not really an "inner circle" kind of guy. Or--or maybe, we don't take over Zaofu! Maybe we can just--let them be on their own, and then, "Yay! The Empire's united! Congratulations to us!"
Kuvira says: I didn't know your personal feelings for Opal were stronger than your loyalty to me. Zaofu will join us. The only thing I'm second-guessing is my decision to bring you along. Maybe you need to spend some time in a reeducation camp.
Bolin says: I ... thought that's where we sent people to learn new trade skills.
Baatar Jr. says:  Hard truths, Bolin.
Kuvira says:  Your loyalty seems to be wavering.
Bolin says:  No--no, I'm totally on your side, completely, one-hundred-percent loyal.

<scene>
Korra says: How did things get so bad between you and Kuvira? I thought she was your protégé.
Suyin says: She was more than that. She was like a daughter to me. I took her in when she was eight years old and nourished her talents. Kuvira was smart, a natural leader, and quickly rose through the ranks. I saw myself in her.
Korra says: What happened?
Suyin says:  Three years ago, after the fall of the Earth Queen, Raiko and Tenzin came to see me.
</scene>

<scene>
Raiko says: The Earth Kingdom is in chaos. There's a vacuum of power, and I'm concerned about what will happen if someone doesn't take control of the situation.
Suyin says: And you think I should be the one?
Tenzin says: You're the perfect person to take charge. The world leaders trust you, and, as a Beifong, you have credibility in the Earth Kingdom.
Suyin says: I'm honored that you thought of me, but I'm not interested in imposing my ideals on an entire nation.  I'm afraid I can't help you.
Kuvira says: Suyin, I know this isn't my place, but I think you should do this. Zaofu has always been a beacon of modern progress, and now you can share that with everyone.
Suyin says: What would you have me do? March into Ba Sing Se with an army? We'd be seen as conquerors and greeted with nothing but war.
Kuvira says: There are already wars. The Earth Queen nearly destroyed our nation. This is our opportunity to change things.
Suyin says:  It's not going to happen.
</scene>

<scene>
Suyin says:  I didn't realize it at the time, but that moment put a rift between us. Kuvira turned my own son against me, and together they plotted behind my back.
Suyin says: What do you think you're doing?
Kuvira says:  We're doing what you don't have the guts to do: We're going to Ba Sing Se to help bring order back to the Earth Kingdom.
Suyin says:  No! You will stay here!
Kuvira says:  And who's going to stop me? Your security force was more than happy to join my cause. They're some of the best fighters in the world, and they are tired of being treated like exotic birds in your cage.
Suyin says: If you leave now, you will never be welcomed back.
Kuvira says: When I choose to return, it'll be on my own terms.
Suyin says:  Kuvira and Baatar left that day with Varrick, my security force, and a few of Zaofu's wealthiest citizens. After Kuvira proved herself by stabilizing Ba Sing Se,  Raiko and the other world leaders made her the provisional head of the Earth Kingdom. When she refused to step down, I knew it was only a matter of time before she made her way back here.
Korra says: I want to fix this.
Suyin says: You can. Go into the Avatar State and demolish her entire army. Remove Kuvira from power once and for all.
Korra says:  Fighting is something the old me would do. That always made things worse. Let me talk with Kuvira. Maybe I can reason with her.
Suyin says:  Kuvira doesn't listen to reason.
</scene>

Varrick says:  I can't believe Kuvira locked me in here like a prisoner! I'm not feeling well! I think I'm running out of air! Zhu Li, hold your breath!
Zhu Li says:  I'm not holding my breath.
Varrick says:  Great! Now we're both gonna die!
Bolin says:  Varrick? Varrick?!
Varrick says: Ahh! And the head voices are back!
Varrick says: Bolin! Thank goodness you're here! Where did that hatch come from? Forget the hatch! There's something important I gotta tell ya!
Bolin says: Well, there's something important I gotta tell you, too!
Varrick and Bolin says:  Kuvira's crazy!
Bolin says: How'd you find out?
Varrick says: When I refused to build her a superweapon, she threatened my life!
Bolin says: She threatened me, too! And she's threatening Zaofu and it turns out, she's been threatening villages this whole time!  We gotta get outta here.
Varrick says: I couldn't agree more, kid.
Baatar Jr. says: We have an unexpected guest. The Avatar is here to see you.
Kuvira says: Korra, it's such an honor to see you again. The last I heard, you were still healing in the South Pole.
Korra says: Well, I'm feeling much better now.
Kuvira says: That's wonderful news.
Korra says: I'm here to ask you to back down. Please. Take your army and leave.
Kuvira says: I think we both know that's not going to happen.
Korra says: I can't let you take Zaofu.
Kuvira says: Look, I was tasked with bringing stability to the Earth Kingdom. Zaofu is the last holdout. Why should I treat it differently than any other state?
Korra says: What you're doing isn't right!
Kuvira says: I understand you're just trying to do Su a favor, but you can't come to me as I am on the verge of reuniting my nation and tell me to stop. The world was descending into chaos while you were gone.  In order to fix it, I had to make some tough decisions.
Korra says: I know what that's like. I've had plenty of people mad at me about decisions I've made.
Kuvira says:  Exactly. Korra, if you really want to help, go back to Su and try to talk some sense into her. Let's call a temporary truce. I won't make any moves until you talk to her and get back to me.
Korra says:  Maybe that will be for the best.

Varrick says: We'll be helping by warning the world about Kuvira's potential superweapon!
Bolin says:  Well, that's helping, but it's a completely different type of helping.  Hmm. Let me think about this.
Varrick says:  That's not the flamethrower! What idiot designed these things?
Zhu Li says: You did, sir!

Hiroshi says: I'm sorry.
Asami says: But when I saw you, it wasn't anger I felt. It was sadness. You tainted our past and destroyed our future together.
Hiroshi says: I want to make amends.
Asami says: I'm not sure I'll ever be able to forgive you. But that doesn't mean I shouldn't try.
Asami says: I thought we could play some Pai Sho. Like we used to.

Bolin says:  Don't ... torture us.
Kuvira says:  Send these three away on the next train. Bolin and Zhu Li will be going to the reeducation camp for our most severe dissenters.  And you will continue work on the spirit-energy project, under close, armed supervision. I want it weaponized immediately. 
Zhu Li says:  Please! Have mercy on me! Don't send me away! Take me back!
Kuvira says:  Why would I?
Zhu Li says:  Because my only mistake was being loyal to the wrong person. I was blindly devoted to Varrick, and I looked past all the times he ridiculed me, or ordered me around, or made me clean his disgusting feet--  --because I thought he possessed the most brilliant mind in the world. But when I met you, I realized I was wrong. Compared to you, Varrick's a fool.
Varrick says:  Hey, come on! I'm right here!
Zhu Li says: I believe in everything you've done, and I believe in your vision. I want to devote my life to you. I pledge my allegiance to you, Great Uniter.
Kuvira says:  You two could learn something from her. Rise, Zhu Li. I'll give you another chance.
Varrick says:  Think about what you're doing! We're partners! We have history!
Zhu Li says:  I did everything you ever asked of me, and you never appreciated it!  Guards, do the thing!

Zaheer says: You won't get out, unless the Metal Clan has taught you a way to bend platinum.  Once we administer this poison, your body will naturally react, forcing you into the Avatar State in an effort to keep you alive. Sadly for you, you'll be entering it for the last time.
Korra says:  No! The Avatar Cycle.
Zaheer says:  Yes. When we dispatch you in the Avatar State, the cycle will end.  So we lucky few, this band of brothers and sisters in anarchy, are witnessing the beginning of an era of true freedom. Together, we will forge a world without kings and queens, without borders or nations, where Man's only allegiance is to himself and those he loves. We will return to the true balance of natural order. And though you will never again be reborn, your name will echo throughout history: Korra, the last Avatar.

Red Lotus sentry #1 says: Oh, so you just called me over to attack me? Fine! Now nobody gets any water.  I don't know how we ended up in daycare while everyone else gets to watch the Avatar being destroyed. I can hold a bowl of poison!

Bumi says: What are you talking about? I feel great!

Kai says: We have to do something!
Bumi says: How can he fly like that?
Tenzin says: He's unlocked powers of airbending that haven't existed for thousands of years.

Korra says: Dad. You're alive.
Tonraq says: I'm here for you.  I'm never gonna let you go.

Korra says:  It's great. Thanks.
Asami says:  You know, nobody expects you to bounce back right away. It's only been two weeks. You need time to heal.  I want you to know that I'm here for you. If you ever want to talk, or, anything. But let's just try to enjoy this today; for Jinora.
Korra says: You're right.  Okay, let's go.
</scene>

Tonraq says:  You look beautiful, sweetie. 
Tenzin says: You're looking stronger everyday, Korra.
Raiko says: I'd like to officially welcome you back to Republic City. I know that the last time we saw each other, it didn't end on the best terms. But I want to thank you for taking down those Red Lotus terrorists.
Asami says: We should go inside.
Ikki says:  I-I can help.
Meelo says:  I want to ride with Korra.  Jinora's already inside. Smells like shoe trees.
Ikki says:  Sandalwood, Meelo.
Lin says: I got this.  Hang in there, kid. 
Raiko says: She's not looking good.
Tonraq says: Neither would you if you'd gone through what she had.
Tenzin says: She'll be fine. She just needs time to heal. The poison took a great toll.
Raiko says: Of course. I'm just saying, with the Earth Kingdom in complete disarray since the loss of the Queen ...
Zuko says: And even with Zaheer locked up again, we still don't know how many Red Lotus members might be out there, hiding.
Raiko says: Exactly. With the world getting more and more dangerous, we need the Avatar now more than ever. Who will protect us while she's in a wheelchair?
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says: Jinora, come forward.  Today, we welcome the first airbending master in a generation. And I couldn't be more proud of my daughter.  When the existence of our people was threatened, when the Avatar's life hung in the balance, Jinora never gave up hope. Thanks to her leadership, I see a very bright future for the Air Nation. Of course, there would be no Air Nation without Avatar Korra: she opened the portals and somehow the world began anew for us. And she was even willing to lay down her own life in order to protect ours. There's no way we can ever repay her for all she's done. But we can follow her example of service and sacrifice. So while she recuperates, the Air Nation will reclaim its nomadic roots and roam the earth.  But unlike our ancestors, we will serve people of all nations, working wherever there is corruption and discord to restore balance and peace. Avatar Korra, I vow that we will do everything in our power to follow in your footsteps and bring harmony to the world.  Now, let us anoint the master who will help lead us in our new path.

Varrick and Bolin returned to warn everyone about Kuvira's spirit vine super weapon. Now Raiko wants to mount a defense against the Earth Empire! Meanwhile, Bolin, Opal, and Lin are on a mission to rescue Su Beifong and her family, who are being held captive by Kuvira!

Lin Beifong says:  You. Zip it. Now. I had enough of your babble on the way in.
Bolin says:  Yes, ma'am.
Opal says: Kuvira tore down all the domes. Why would she do that?
Lin says:  She's got a whole battalion of troops stationed there. There's no way we'll be able to spot anything useful from here. We'll have to go in for a closer look.
Toph says: Don't bother. All the prisoners have been moved.
Lin says:  Uh ... hey, Chief.
Toph says: Hey, Chief.
Opal says:  Grandma Toph!
Toph says: You were only up to my waist the last time we were together.
Bolin says:  Oh, man! Ohh, I can't. This can't be happening! 
Toph says: What?! Do you have to pee or something? 
Bolin says: No ... well, now, maybe. You're my hero! My name is Bolin. I'm dating your granddaughter, I mean, kind of. I may have screwed that up, but that's why I'm here and you're my hero! Oh, I said that. Can I have a hug too?
Toph says: What's up with him?
Lin says: He's an actor. So, you already checked the city for Su? How did you know she was captured?
Toph says: I've been living in the swamp and keeping watch on Zaofu through the vines.
Bolin says: Sure, okay, makes sense.
Toph says: By the time I got here, they were gone. I snooped around town and heard that they were taken away to some nearby prison camp.
Opal says:  Where would that be?
Bolin says:  There's a factory and reeducation facility not too far away.
Toph says:  How do you know that?
Opal says: Bolin used to work for Kuvira.
Toph says:  How did you end up dating the kind of dipstick who works for Kuvira?
Bolin says:  "Used to"!
Lin says:  It's not his silver tongue, I can tell you that. 
Bolin says:  Please tell me this attitude isn't hereditary.

Raiko says: The borders are secure and troops are guarding the rail lines into the city.  So what have you two geniuses come up with to fend off Kuvira?
Varrick says:  It's a flying mecha suit!  Asami got the idea from watching dragonfly-hummingbirds. You can take off straight up, fly in any direction—
Raiko says:  Where does the spirit ray come out?
Varrick says:  It doesn't have a spirit ray. I'm telling you what I told Kuvira: That technology should not be used!
Raiko says:  It's already being used by Kuvira! I need spirit vine weapons and I need them now!
Korra says:  No. It was Kuvira's harvesting of the vines in the swamp that caused the Republic City vines to go crazy and grab all those people.
Raiko says: You're supposed to be the bridge between the two worlds. Why can't you harvest the vines?
Korra says: I won't do that. But maybe since the spirits love Republic City so much, I can convince them to help us defend it somehow.
Raiko says:  Hm.
Wu says: Okay, maybe while the weapon geniuses and the spirit bridge are getting ready for battle, we should be evacuating the ordinary citizens so that if Kuvira attacks, they won't be hurt.
Raiko says:  That's ... actually a good idea.  Prince Wu, you work with the police to coordinate getting people out of the city. Now everyone get to it. I want daily updates.

Mako says: Nice job in there. I'm proud of you. You're starting to act like the kind of king I'd like to work for.
Wu says: Thanks.  And if Korra buys this "man of the people" thing, I still might get to date her.
Mako says:  You always have to ruin it.
Wu says: What? Come on! Why do you think guys do anything great? To pick up girls. Every work of art, every song, every city evacuation, all for the ladies.

Zhu Li says: There's a problem with the condenser. It's backing up!
Baatar Jr. says:  Shut it down.
Zhu Li says:  I can't. The override isn't working. Everyone needs to evacuate. This thing is going to blow!
Baatar Jr. says:  Everyone get out! Now!
Zhu Li says: Come on, Baatar! It's too late!
Baatar Jr. says:  This channeling ring was cracked. That's what caused the reaction to overload.  Now we're taking this whole thing apart tonight and checking everything! Nothing is too small. This has to be ready by tomorrow.

Toph says:  I think I know where they are. Feel that cavern a few stories down? It seems empty, but it's guarded by an awful lot of mech.
Lin says:  Right. Why would you need soldiers guarding an empty cavern? They must have them in some kind of suspended prison, so they can't use their earthbending. 
Bolin says: Someone's coming. Hide!
Baatar Jr. says: I didn't expect you until tomorrow.
Kuvira says:  I just wanted to check in to make sure everything was on track. It looks wonderful.
Baatar Jr. says: We've had a few minor malfunctions, but we should be ready for the test tomorrow.
Kuvira says:  You've been working on this the entire time, Zhu Li. What do you think the problem is?
Zhu Li says: It's a very complex machine. There are bound to be some bugs to work out.
Kuvira says: But you're doing everything you can to fix those, correct?
Zhu Li says: Of course, your eminence.

Opal says:  We should be thinking of a way to take out Kuvira while we have the chance.
Bolin says: Or at least destroy the cannon. If she takes that to Republic City, it could obliterate everything.
Toph says: I didn't come to fight with Kuvira or destroy a cannon. I'm here to save my family.  It will take everything we have just to get out alive. 
Bolin says:  Hmm. Kuvira wants every single one of her people to see the weapon test tomorrow, so the factory will be mostly empty then. That's our best chance to sneak in and free Su without being spotted.
Opal says:  Good thinking, Bolin.
Bolin says: Thanks.  I kind of have a headache now.

Bolin says:  So let me ask you about metalbending. Su tried to teach me, but I couldn't get the hang of it.
Toph says:  I used to have an academy to train metalbending. Even blockheads like you can figure it out with the right instruction.
Lin says: Yeah, you're a real sensitive instructor.
Bolin says: I did learn how to lavabend.
Toph says:  Really? It's a very rare ability.  Maybe you do have some talent.
Bolin says:  I can't believe ... you think I'm talented?  That means so much to me coming from my hero.
Lin says: Yeah, she's real encouraging.
Toph says: Hey! I'm blind, not deaf.
Bolin says: So here's something I've always been curious about: Who's Lin's dad?
Toph says: He was a guy named Kanto. Nice man, but it didn't really work out between us.
Bolin says: And ...  okay.
Toph says: Lin, I can feel your enraged breathing from here. Just say what you have to say and let's get it over with.
Lin says:  Just get it over with? Yeah, let's not linger on the fact that I grew up without a dad. No need to get all touchy-feely about it. Just one of those things, right?
Toph says: Hey, I forgave you for all your garbage a long time ago and Su and I worked things out.  You're the only one who wants to hold on to this family drama nonsense  for the rest of your life. 
Lin says:  Forgave me for what?!  And not knowing my dad is nonsense to you?  It was pretty important to me.  And until now, you would never even discuss it. You know, after Su and I patched things up, I thought, "maybe I should try to reach out to mom."  But now that we're together again, I remember why we stopped talking.  You make me furious  and you don't even know why. And when I tell you, you don't care.  Once we save Su, you and I are finished.
Toph says:  If that's your decision and it makes you happy, then fine.

Kuvira says: What's wrong?
Baatar Jr. says:  Probably something minor.  I should be able to find the problem.  The distributor pin is gone.  I swear I locked it in place yesterday. There's no way it could have just fallen out. 
Kuvira says: And this could cause the entire weapon to fail?
Baatar Jr. says: It could cause it to explode.
Kuvira says:  What do you know about this?
Zhu Li says: Nothing.
Kuvira says:  You swore your loyalty to me and I gave you a chance at greatness.  This is how you repay me?!
Zhu Li says:  You're a monster. I regret nothing.
Kuvira says:  Chain her up in the target town. She can see how the weapon works  up close and personal.
Opal says:  Oh, no.

Bolin says: What?  No, I have to go save her.
Lin says: You can't go in there, kid. It's suicide. Kuvira's onto us.
Bolin says: We've been through too much together. I can't leave her. Toph, you said Zhu Li was lying about fixing the cannon. She must have been trying to stop it.
Toph says: For all you know, she could just have been covering her butt because she made a mistake.
Bolin says:  No, Zhu Li doesn't make mistakes. You guys leave. If we make it out, we'll make it to the city somehow.
Opal says: Bolin, no!  You guys get out of here. I have to go with Bolin. 
Suyin says:  Could be our best chance to stop Kuvira.
Lin says:  Maybe take out that weapon.
Wing says: We can't let Opal be the coolest!
Toph says: If you all want to get yourselves captured again or worse, that's your business. I'm through.

Korra says: Spirits, this is the Avatar.  Please listen to me.  Since I opened the portals, spirits and humans have lived happily together in Republic City. It's all I could have hoped for. I know you felt the effects of Kuvira cutting down spirit vines. But now isn't the time for you to flee the city.  It's time for you to help me save it from Kuvira, who was perverting spirit power to use as a weapon against other humans. 
Dragon eel spirit says: We don't  get involved with human wars.
Korra says: Spirits worked with Unalaq.
Dragon eel spirit says: He was misusing Vaatu's power during Harmonic Convergence to force spirits to fight you. Is that what you want?
Korra says: No, but as the Avatar, I'm hoping that you will come to my aid to save the new world we all share.
Dragon eel spirit says:  What you want is exactly what Kuvira wants: to use spirits as a weapon in a human war.  The answer is no.
Korra says: Wait! Please, listen.  If spirits and humans are gonna live together, we have to work with each other!

Lin says: Yeah, thanks, Chief.  I'm sorry for what I said last night. I was just ... you know.
Toph says: Look, I know I wasn't a great mother, but one way or another, I ended up with two great kids. Good enough to risk my bony old butt for, anyway. If you can just find some way not to hate me, maybe that's enough, at least for me.
Lin says: Me too. 
Bolin says: You know, I never had any family except for my brother  until a few years ago,  and reuniting with them made me realize how special it is.
Toph says: Argh, enough!  Enjoy the ride back to the city  with the gum flapper here.
Opal says: Aren't you coming back to Republic City with us, Grandma?
Toph says: No, my fighting days are over. Don't tell Korra, but my back is killing me now. This is why you didn't see Katara messing with that civil war nonsense. At some point, you gotta leave it to the kids. 
Zhu Li says: I want to thank you for coming back to save me. And don't be too hard on Bolin for working with Kuvira. His heart was in the right place.
Opal says:  I think Bolin has worked his way out of the polar bear doghouse. 
Bolin says:  Yes! 
Zhu Li says: We should get going. I'm afraid I have bad news to deliver to Republic City.  Kuvira is going to attack in two weeks.

Huntsman says:  All right. Welcome to the hunt.

Wan says:  The lion turtle.
Huntsman says: Great guardian of our city, we are venturing into the Spirit Wilds to bring back food for our people. Please, grant us the power of fire.
Lion turtle says:  The power is yours to keep until your return.
Huntsman says: You're first, kid.
Lion turtle says: May the element of fire protect you against the spirits.
Huntsman says: Just make sure you aim at the spirits, not us, okay?
Wan says: Sure thing.
Huntsman says: Everyone, stay close. Spirits love to pick off stragglers.
Wan says: Uh, guys?  I don't think I can do this.
Huntsman says: Now, quit your whining. We haven't even seen a spirit yet.
Wan says:  I think I wanna go home.
Huntsman says:  I knew you were nothing but a sniveling coward. Go give your fire back to the lion turtle,  and don't ever show your face around me again.

Jaya says:  What did you do? You can't steal from the lion turtle.
Wan says:  Really?  Because I just did. 
</scene>

<scene>
Jaya says:  You know it's forbidden to bring the power of the element into the city. Please, go back to the lion turtle and return the fire.
Wan says: Jaya, it's time to stop being so afraid of the Chous and show them we have the power to change things.

Big Chou says:  You're not getting past us.  We have the weapons.  You're powerless.
Wan says:  Powerless, huh?
</scene>

Wan says:  Follow me!

Wan says:  I'm not telling you anything.
Chou the Elder says:  Then, you've left me no choice.  Wan, you are hereby banished.
Little Chou says: Yeah!  And give back the fire you stole.
Wan says: No! Wait. Great lion turtle, I am sorry for stealing the fire from you, and I accept my punishment. But please, I need to be able to protect myself in the wilds.
Lion turtle says:  Never again may you return to this city.  But  I will allow you to keep the power of the element.

Aye-aye spirit says: You dare use fire against me?  Now, be gone with you!

Aye-aye spirit says: And who might you be?
Wan says:  I am Bushy, the Bush Spirit. And I would like the enter your oasis.
Aye-aye spirit says:  Very well.  You may pass.  Wait a second.  Something stinks.  I knew I smelled a human!
</scene>

<scene>
Wan says:  Come on, let me in, just for a little while.
Aye-aye spirit says: No! Go back to your lion turtle.
Wan says: Believe me, I'd love to go back home. But I can't. I was kicked out.
Friendly spirit #1 says: That's too bad.
Friendly spirit #2 says: Poor human.
Aye-aye spirit says: Don't pity him. He's just like every other human: ugly, destructive, and lacking any respect for nature.
Wan says: Who are you calling ugly, Ugly?
Aye-aye spirit says:  Mmm.
Friendly spirit #1 says: If you can't go back to your city, then you should go live in another one.
Wan says:  What? There are other lion turtles?
Aye-aye spirit says:  "There are other lion turtles?"  Of course there are,  dozens of them! Boy, you humans are stupid, too.
Wan says: So which way to the nearest lion turtle city?
Aye-aye spirit says:  Hmm. I think it's on the other side of none-of-your-business valley. 
Wan says: Real funny. You know what? I don't need your help. I'll find it myself.

Wan says: Back off.
Huntsman says: Wan? What are you doing here?
Wan says: I'm saving this animal.
Huntsman says: That animal's our dinner. Now, get out of the way.
Wan says: No!
Hunter #3 says: Ahh! He-help! Help! 
Hunter #4 says:  Get 'em off! Get 'em off!  Ahh!
Huntsman says: Well, looks like you're all out of tricks, Wan.
Aye-aye spirit says: I. Really. Hate. Humans!
Huntsman says:  No, no! 
Aye-aye spirit says: I don't know what he's screaming about.  He's better looking now.
Wan says: I feel great. What's in this water?
Aye-aye spirit says: It has special healing properties.
Wan says:  Thanks.  So what did you do to that hunter?
Aye-aye spirit says: Spirits are able to take over a human body for a short time. If I stayed in there any longer, I would've killed him, which I did consider.
Wan says: Thanks for saving my neck. But why'd you do it?
Aye-aye spirit says: I saw you save the cat deer from those hunters. I've never seen such an act of selflessness from a human before.
Wan says: Told you I wasn't like the others. 
Aye-aye spirit says: Guess I underestimated you, human.
Friendly spirit #2 says: Are you off to find another lion turtle city?
Wan says: I was. But I think I've had enough of humans for a while. I've decided to stay here and learn the ways of the spirits.
Friendly spirit #1 says: What a great idea.
Friendly spirit #2 says: That'll be fun.
Aye-aye spirit says: Oh, now, now, hold on. A human living with spirits? It's never been done.
Wan says: First time for everything, right?
Aye-aye spirit says: Hmm. I guess we can try it. I've never had a human as a pet before. I think I'll call you "Stinky."
Wan says: The name is Wan.
Aye-aye spirit says: Stinky is more accurate.

Citizen #1 says: What happened in the wilds?
Citizen #2 says: Where are the others?
Huntsman says: Gone. Spirits took them.  They were protecting that kid, Wan, like he was one of their own.
Jaya says:  Did you hear that?  Wan's still alive.
</scene>

<scene>
Huntsman says:  And the way Wan moves fire, it's like nothing I've ever seen.  He uses it like it's an extension of his body.
</scene>

Jaya says:  Wan has proved that with the power of fire, anyone can survive in the wilds.  We don't have to live under Chou the Elder's rules anymore, so I say we leave this city and start over.  Who's with me?

Wan says:  You ready to go, Mula?
Aye-aye spirit says: You sure you want to leave?
Wan says: Yes. It's time I see the rest of the world and find the other lion turtle cities.
Aye-aye spirit says: I'm proud to call you my friend, Stinky.
Wan says:  Thank you for everything.  Goodbye, everyone.
Friendly spirit #1 says:  We'll miss you.

Wan says: It does when the lives of spirits and animals are in danger.
Vaatu says: If you're a friend to spirits, then use your fire to help me break free.
Raava says: Don't involve the human. This is between us.
Vaatu says: Please, save me. She has tormented me for ten thousand years.
Wan says:  Ten thousand years?  Let him go!
Vaatu says: Thank you, human. You have performed a great service for the spirits. 
Raava says:  Do you realize what you've done?
Wan says: Yeah, I helped a spirit who was being bullied by you.
Raava says: You are gravely mistaken. I was keeping him under control.
Wan says:  And what gives you the right?
Raava says: You don't even know who I am, do you?
Wan says: Should I?
Raava says: Yes. My name is Raava.  That spirit you freed is Vaatu.  He is the force of darkness and chaos. I am the force of light and peace. Since the beginning of time, we have battled over the fate of this world.  And for the past ten thousand years, I have kept darkness under control and the world in balance,  until you came along.
Wan says:  So, by freeing Vaatu, I let chaos into the world?
Raava says:  Precisely. The human and spirit realms are headed toward annihilation,  and it's all your fault.
Korra says:  Raava.  I found you.

Shiro Shinobi says:  The new Air Nation is in jeopardy. In an effort to force Korra to surrender herself, Zaheer ambushed the Northern Air Temple. Tenzin, Bumi, and Kya attempted to hold off the Red Lotus, but were injured in battle. The airbenders were unable to escape and everyone was taken captive except Kai. Now Korra and Team Avatar race to the temple hoping to mount a rescue.

Suyin says:  I say we make our approach from the west, drop down from the airship on cables, ambush these Red Lotus low-lives before they know what hit them.
Lin says: It will never work. That Combustion Lady will pick us off one by one.
Suyin says: You have a better idea on how to save the airbenders?
Lin says: Yeah. We come up from the valley, scale the side of the mountain and take them off guard.
Tonraq says: That could work.
Suyin says: And give them the high ground? No, if their lavabender spots us, he'll melt the mountainside and us with it.
Bolin says: Wait, I've got it. I'll disguise myself as a lost hiker, and once I'm in the temple, I'll distract the Red Lotus with my bird calls.  That's when you all strike.
Mako says: Bird calls, really?
Bolin says: Well I haven't noticed you offering any suggestions.
Korra says: It doesn't matter. None of these ideas will work. The second Zaheer realizes we're up to something, he'll wipe out the airbenders.
Suyin says: And Opal is one of those airbenders. Believe me, I understand what's at stake.
Korra says: Then I'll think you agree that the only plan that will work is for me to give myself up.
Mako says: What?
Lin says: Korra, no.
Tonraq says: We'll figure out another way.
Korra says: I talked it over with Lord Zuko, and I've given it a lot of thought. I have to do this.
Asami says: You can't expect us to sit by and let Zaheer take you.
Korra says: The world has been out of balance for far too long: it needs the Air Nation back again. I can't let Zaheer destroy it and everyone we love. Help me save the airbenders, then you can worry about saving me.
Tonraq says:  We're with you, Korra.
Suyin says: Yes, whatever you need, they're here.
Korra says: I'll go radio Zaheer.

Korra says: Zaheer, are you there? It's me.
Zaheer says: I've been waiting for your call. So, do we have a deal?
Korra says: Yes. You release the airbenders, and then I'll turn myself over.
Zaheer says: And take away the only leverage I have? No. I can't do that. Listen carefully, here's what I need you to do.
</scene>

Mako says:  Will you sit down? I'm already tense enough as it is.
Bolin says: I'm just worried about Opal, and Pabu's not here to comfort me.  I hope he and Naga are doing okay back in Zaofu.

Tonraq says: Did you speak to Zaheer?
Korra says:  Yes. He told me to come to the top of Laghima's Peak at noon, alone. Once he has me, he'll release the airbenders over to you at the temple.
Suyin says: I think I figured a way to play this so that the airbenders and Korra all come out in one piece.
Lin says: How?
Suyin says: Zaheer doesn't know how many of us there are, so we have the numbers advantage. I say we split into two teams:  Mako, Bolin and Asami will take the airship up to the temple.  Meanwhile, my metalbenders, Tonraq, Lin, and I will get in position below Laghima's Peak.

Zaheer says: Thank you, P'Li. For everything.
P'Li says: Of course. 
Zaheer says: I want you to know:  not one day went by in that prison when I didn't think of you.
P'Li says:  The years apart only made my love for you stronger. And deep down I knew you would find a way to get me out. Just like you saved me from becoming that warlord's killing machine when I was a girl.  You've shown me what true freedom means.
Zaheer says: And after today,  we'll show the entire world what it means. No more prisons, no more running.
P'Li says: I love you, Zaheer.

Korra says: I love you, Dad.
Tonraq says: I love you too, sweetheart.

Bolin says: Not gonna happen. The exit's blocked.

Lin says: How did you guys make it out of the temple alive?
Mako says: It was all Bolin. I thought we were done for, then out of nowhere, he lavabends.
Suyin says: I knew you had the potential for something big. You just had to believe in yourself.
Bolin says: You're right. Being moments from death was a pretty good motivator too. Of course, we would have never made it back with Kai.
Kai says: Glad I could help. So anyway-
Tenzin says: Did Zaheer get away with Korra?
Lin says: I'm afraid so.
Suyin says: Apparently, he can fly now.
Tenzin says: What?
Asami says: How?
Bolin says: Are you sure?
Lin says: I wouldn't believe it either if I hadn't seen it for myself.
Tenzin says: I've heard the legends about Guru Laghima's ability to fly. I'd never imagine they were true.
Tonraq says: So what's our next move?
Kai says: I have an idea.
Lin says: Not right now, kid! We need to figure out where Zaheer took Korra.
Tenzin says: And find the airbenders.
Kai says:  That's what I've been trying to tell you.  I know where the airbenders are, and I bet it's where Korra is too.
Mako says: Well, why didn't you say something? 
Tenzin says: Where are they? How did you find them?
Kai says: After I got blasted out the sky, I woke up on the side of the mountain,  where this little fellow found me. I tried to sneak back into the temple, to see if I could rescue anyone, and that's when I saw the airship leaving. I followed it into some caves a few miles from here. The giant lady and some people put the airbenders into the caves.
Lin says: Was it Ghazan and Ming-Hua?
Kai says: No, there were four more of them. They didn't look familiar.
Mako says: Must be more Red Lotus members than we thought.
Kai says: I couldn't fight them on my own, so I came back here, hoping you guys would show up.
Lin says: We need to get to those caves.
Kai says: How? I don't think we can all fit on my bison.
Tenzin says: Oogi!  I'm glad to see you too, old friend.

Kai says: That's okay. I probably deserved it.
Mako says: Yeah, you kind of did.

Ming-Hua says: Why didn't you ever tell us you could fly?
Zaheer says: I wasn't sure I could. Only one other airbender in history had the ability.

Zaheer says: I found true freedom. I am no longer bound to this earth by worldly desires. I have entered the void.
Ming-Hua says:  Where's P'Li?

Mako says: What about all the people who haven't been evacuated yet? If Kuvira finds out that Wu is with them, she might fire that spirit cannon at him and take them all out.
Korra says: I couldn't stop Kuvira from taking Zaofu. I'm not letting her conquer Republic City. The world isn't safe as long as she has that weapon.
Lin says: I agree. We take down that giant today.
Korra says: Lin!
Lin says:  Glad to see you all made it out. You had me worried.

Asami says: Not all of them. There are the prototypes back at my office. If we can get those ready to fly, we'll at least be able to offer a little air support.

Varrick says: I remember when I was a boy, I had an ostrich horse. Named her Mrs. Beaks.  I grew up on a farm. Did I ever tell you that, Zhu Li? This was before the circus people took me away. Anyway, I loved old Mrs. Beaks, but I took her for granted.
Zhu Li says: You'll have to finish your story later. Kuvira's troops are in range.  Okay, I hope this works.
</scene>

<scene>
Varrick says: Yes! Dead in their tracks.  Oh, rats. She's still coming. Zhu Li, do the thing!
Zhu Li says: I'm afraid there are no more things to do.
Kuvira says: What was that?
Soldier says: An electromagnetic pulse. It shut down the mecha suits, but our power source is fine.
Kuvira says: Locate the source of the pulse. That must be where Varrick is. Third and fourth mech platoons, move in and continue the sweep. Capture anyone left in the city.
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: Varrick, how come your electro-thingy shut down the small mecha suits but not the big one?
Baatar Jr. says: Because it's powered with spirit vine energy. I'm sorry. I wish I could help you, but it's unstoppable.
Hiroshi says: It's not.
Asami says:  Dad? 
Lin says: I got him out of jail to help. I figured we need all the geniuses we can get our hands on right now. If the prison's still standing after all this is over, we can throw him back in.
Hiroshi says: I know what you all must think of me, but I love Republic City and I would do anything to save her.
Korra says:  You think you know how to defeat this thing?
Hiroshi says: You must act like an infection: break the skin and attack its vital organs, disconnect the heart and the brain and this beast cannot live.
Korra says: But how are we supposed to get inside?
Hiroshi says: Future Industries has plasma saws for cutting platinum. If we had one on the mecha suit ...
Asami says: But the saws are way too big. We'd never get the suits off the ground.
Hiroshi says: I think I can add an electrical element to the welding torch on your suit and convert it into a plasma saw. Then we'll just have to land on the giant and cut open a hole big enough for someone to get in.
Asami says: Like a metal mosquito.
Varrick says: You know what happens to mosquitoes that land on me? I squash 'em!
Korra says: We'll have to attack in a swarm to try to keep you guys safe in the hummingbird suits. It looks like they're our only hope.

Pema says: Oh, first he ate the fruit, then he ate the leaves. Hungry little lemur, ate up all my trees.  Okay, great job everybody. Who's got another song for us?
Evacuee says:  We can't just sit around here singing old airbender songs until we're all captured, or worse.
Pema says: Should we play the button game? Who has a button?
Pema says: Where do these badgermoles come from?
Wu says: The zoo! Mako always hated my singing, but they love it!
Evacuee says: Well, what are we supposed to do with badgermoles?
Wu says: They're the best earthbenders around! We can use them to tunnel out of the city without Kuvira's troops spotting us.
Evacuee says: Are you sure this is the best plan?  Let's follow the moles!
Wu says:  Badgermoles, digging holes, under Republic City. Got to run away from Kuvira today, although I do still think she's pretty.
Kuvira says: Mech platoons, report.
Third platoon says:  Third platoon, no sign of anyone so far.
Fourth platoon says: Fourth platoon, en route to train station.
Soldier says: I think we found the source of the electromagnetic pulse:  Future Industries Tower.
Kuvira says: That's the place.
</scene>

<scene>
Daw says: Kuvira is headed our way!
Korra says:  How long will it take to get the plasma saws ready?
Asami says: Just a few more minutes.
Korra says: Get out there as soon as you can.
Baatar Jr. says: If you do manage to get inside, find the engine room. There are two emergency levers. If you switch them off at the same time, you'll cut the power.
Korra says: Thanks.  We may not be able to beat that thing, but we can slow it down. Let's go!

Wu says:  Oh, Yin, you're the sweetest evacuee I've ever known.  And I just want to thank you for being so kind, when I was living in your home.
Earth Empire sergeant says: Halt!  Turn around slowly and please, stop that singing. You're all Earth Empire prisoners. Come with us and no one will get hurt.
Wu says: You don't need these people. They're just innocent civilians caught in the crossfire, but I'm Prince Wu, rightful leader of the Earth Kingdom.  Take me to Kuvira. I've got business with her.
Tu says: No! Don't do it, Wu.
Wu says: I have to. But before I go,  I'd like to sing you a song.  If you don't respect the broach, you don't respect me. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You're no better than a roach,  but I'm royalty. I got my badgermoles with me.
Earth Empire sergeant says: Actually, your song is so bad, your badgermoles deserted you.
Wu says:  You don't know what you're talking about.  Oh, badgermoles I love you, I love you. I want to, I want to pet your snouts.

Asami says: If we stop that mecha giant, it will all be because of you.
Hiroshi says: You're the one who designed these incredible suits.  It's great to be working together again.
Asami says: I love you, Dad.
Hiroshi says: I love you, too.
Varrick says: Zhu Li?
Zhu Li says: Yes?
Varrick says:  I have something I need to attach before we take off.
Zhu Li says:  Attached to what?
Varrick says:  I need to attach this ring  to your finger. Zhu Li Moon, will you do the thing for the rest of our lives?
Zhu Li says: Yes.
Varrick says:  Yes!  Now let's go attach these barely functional rust buckets to a giant killer smashing machine!
Zhu Li says: It's exactly how I always pictured our engagement.
</scene>

<scene>
Varrick says: Aim for that spot in the middle of the back - the one I can never reach.
Zhu Li says: Got it.
Varrick says: Wah, let's get out of here!  Wow! I wish I had that kind of flexibility.
Zhu Li says: Hang on!
Kuvira says: I need more power! They're cutting in! More power!
Asami says: We need to get out of here.
Hiroshi says: Almost there.
Asami says:  We have to go now!
Hiroshi says:  Almost there. Almost there!
Asami says:  Dad! Now!
Hiroshi says: Goodbye, Asami. I love you. 
Asami says:  Dad!
Korra says: Hiroshi's plan worked. There's our opening.

Shiro Shinobi says:  Welcome to Republic City, the place of hopes, dreams and Spirit Wilds!  This metropolis truly has something for everyone. Visit Air Temple Island, the hub for all airbenders as they travel the world, helping others. Or take a stroll through beautiful Avatar Korra Park, named in honor of "You-Know-Who"! We've missed her these past three years and we can't wait to welcome her home. Get well soon, Korra! And of course, you'll want to see our most unique attractions: the Spirit Wilds. Here, spirits and people live harmoniously together.  Like this old codger, and his new pals. Yes siree, this town is truly on the up and up! Come be a part of the action in Republic City!
Raiko says:  And of course, my biggest thanks goes to Asami Sato and Future Industries. She brought our old central terminal into the modern era. Ladies and gentlemen, the world is entering a new age of peace and prosperity. Soon, Prince Wu will take his rightful place on the Earth Kingdom throne.  And thanks to our updated rail system, Republic City and the Earth Kingdom will be united like never before!
Wu says: Hey there! Asami, right? Great train house. Maybe you can give me a personal tour sometime, what do you say?
Asami says:  I do like the idea of putting you on a train and sending you far, far away.
Wu says:  That's ... that's funny. I like funny dames. Maybe I should introduce myself. I'm Prince Wu, future king.
Asami says: Yeah ... I'm aware of who you are.
Wu says: Don't let my reputation intimidate you. I'm still human just like everyone else. Only more human, like, extra human, or, hmm, superhuman.
Asami says:  Superhuman?
Wu says: So, what do you say? Can I show you a low-key night out with a superhuman soon-to-be king?
Mako says: Prince Wu! President Raiko has some really important ... king stuff to talk to you about.
Wu says:  Now?  Fine.  Think over the offer.  I'll be back. 
Mako says: He's a real charmer, huh?
Asami says: He's ... something. How can you stand being his bodyguard?
Mako says: Well, I just remind myself that once he's on the throne, I go back to being a detective.
Asami says: And that works?
Mako says:  I also go home, and smash my head into the wall for an hour, you know, just to get the stress out.
Asami says:  It's good to see you, Mako. It's been too long. You hear from Bolin lately?
Mako says: I haven't talked to him for a while, but he's coming in a few days for the coronation. And Beifong told me that Korra is getting in tonight.
Asami says: I can't wait to see her.  It's going to be weird, having the old Team Avatar back in the city after all these years.

Tenzin says: After your coronation, the United Forces will escort you to Ba Sing Se.
Wu says: Right. About that. Are we all positive that the Earth Kingdom is safe enough for me to return? I don't have to remind everyone what happened to my great-aunt three years ago?!  May she rest in peace.
Raiko says: Prince Wu, I assure you, Kuvira has the Earth Kingdom pretty much stabilized at this point.
Wu says:  Uh ... define "pretty much".
Tenzin says: Well, the roving bandits have mostly been dispersed.
Wu says: Mostly?
Lin says: Don't worry kid. The chances of you being assassinated are almost zero.
Wu says: Almost?
Shopkeeper says: Get out of here! We don't have anything left.
Bandit #1 says: Now you don't have anything left.
Kai says: It's safe to come out, everyone! The airbenders are here.
Governor says: You finally made it! So where are the rest of you?
Opal says: Actually, it's just the two of us, but we're going to do everything we can to help. I'm Opal, and this is Kai.
Kai says: It's nice to meet you.
Governor says:  What? I called Master Tenzin because my state has been under siege by bandits for months. They blocked all the roads, cut off our supply lines, and all he sent is you two kids?
Kai says: Hey, us two kids just took care of those three guys for you.
Governor says: There are hundreds more where they came from. My citizens are going hungry. Our entire state is on the brink of collapse.
Opal says: Unfortunately, the Air Nation is spread thin right now. We're all you have.

Bolin says: We just got some good news.  Two more Earth Kingdom states have agreed to join us.
Baatar Jr. says: Excellent! Thank you, Bolin.  We're ninety percent there, Kuvira.
Varrick says:  That's great! Zhu Li, dish out some of that special celebration tea!
Kuvira says: None for me. I won't celebrate until the Earth Kingdom is one hundred percent reunited.
Kuvira says: Why have we stopped?
Driver says: Apologies. There are rocks on the tracks. It's most likely bandits. We're sending troops to handle the situation.
Kuvira says: Call them off. I will take care of the bandits myself.

Female bandit #1 says: You're ... Kuvira.
Kuvira says: And you're the bandits who have been causing chaos where I'm trying to establish order, aren't you?
Female bandit #1 says:  We're sorry, we didn't know this was your train and ...
Kuvira says:  Don't talk over me! 
Male bandit #1 says: Please, take mercy on us!
Kuvira says: Stop groveling as if this is the worst day of your life. This ... is a good day. I'm going to give you all the opportunity to rehabilitate yourselves, and become productive members of your nation. Right now, you're lost, but pledge your loyalty to me, and I'll give you a new purpose in your lives. Of course, if you don't want to join, you could always stay right here. Hopefully, someone saves you before the next train speeds through, but I wouldn't count on it.
Male bandit #1 says: No, we'll join. Don't leave us here.
Female bandit #1 says: We pledge our loyalty to you, Great Uniter.
Mako says: I don't know why we're leaving so early if you're just getting a haircut. The dinner at Air Temple Island isn't until later tonight.
Wu says: Because I'm not just getting a haircut, it's a spa day! We're talking minimum four hours.
Mako says: Are you kidding me?  What are you having done that takes four hours?
Wu says: A rejuvenating tea-leaf skin wrap. Have you ever gotten one of those, Mako?
Mako says: Yeah, I'm ... not interested.
Wu says:  You will be.  So while your hands soak in a bubbling milk-bath, your feet are in a tub full of these little sucker-fish that literally eat your calluses away. Gobble them right up! Crazy, huh?
Mako says: That's disgusting!
Wu says: Then, they scrape your skin with blocks of sea-salt and lube you up with seaweed-infused aloe, wrap you in tea leaves, put you in a hot box for four hours, and bam! You're done!  Mako, look at all my fans! They must be in town for my coronation.
Mako says:  I don't know if all those people are your fans.

Mako says:  Wu, we have to get you out of here!  Go! Go!
Wu says: What just happened out there?
Mako says: I think those were Kuvira's supporters in the crowd.
Wu says:  Oh no! Mako, I've been hit! It's a gusher!
Mako says:  That's not blood. It's strawberry pie.
Wu says:  Oh. Yeah, you're right.  But that was close. I don't know what would have happened if you weren't there.
Mako says: You would have been hit by a pie. It's really not that big of a deal.
Wu says: Or I could have been killed! I don't know what I'd ever do without you! Wait a second. Did you say strawberry pie?  I'm allergic to strawberries!  I don't think I can breathe! Get me to the hospital! Wu down!
Mako says:  You're allergic to bee stings!
Wu says:  Oh. Yeah, you're right.  I always get those two mixed up.

Kai says:  Bolin!
Bolin says:  Kai!  Wow, you are a lot heavier than you used to be. You're really growing up.
Kai says: What's up with your new hair? You look like a stiff.
Bolin says:  Hey, Kuvira says it makes me look intelligent and professional.
Opal says:  Don't believe everything she says.
Bolin says: Opal, I can't believe you're here too!  I missed you so much.
Opal says: I missed you too.
Baatar Jr. says: Look who it is. It's good to see you again, little sister.
Kuvira says: What a wonderful surprise. A happy reunion for my favorite couple.
Baatar Jr. says:  How's Mom doing?
Opal says:  Like you care. She still hasn't forgiven you.
Baatar Jr. says: You know, for someone who claims to be so enlightened, Mom can really hold a grudge.
Opal says: I guess when her son betrays her ...
Kuvira says:  Please, Opal, we're not here to bicker with you about something that happened three years ago. We're here to help this town, just like you.
Opal says:  I've heard how you help towns. By conquering them.
Kuvira says: I know the rumors about me can be pretty nasty, but I am giving everyone in this nation a better future. And with Bolin's help, and my fiancé's ideas, we're laying the ground work for the people to achieve their own greatness.
Opal says:  Your fiancé?
Kuvira says: You haven't heard?  Your brother and I are getting married.
Bolin says:  Isn't that great, sweetie?
Kuvira says: I know things got heated with your family when Baatar and I left Zaofu, but don't you think it's time to forgive and forget?

Kuvira says:  Hello, governor. I was wondering if you and I could talk privately.
</scene>

<scene>
Kuvira says: So, have you had time to rethink my generous offer?
Governor says: Generous? You want to take everything. How is that generous?
Kuvira says: Governor, your state has been overrun by bandits. They have you outnumbered and outsupplied. The question's not if they'll take over; it's when. Unless you sign our deal. Agree to the terms, and you'll have the full force of my army backing you. You will remain in charge, just under my supervision. I will save your life, and the lives of your citizens. I think that's pretty generous.
Governor says:  I know how you manipulate states, and force them to join up under you. I know the only reason you want this region is because it is rich in ore.  They might call you "The Great Uniter", but you're destroying everything! I'll never turn the great state of Yi over to you!
Kuvira says:  You have a lot of pride, but it cannot protect your people.  Your pride will not stop the hordes as your city crumbles to the ground. And your pride will certainly not feed your hungry when all that is left is rubble!
Governor says:  Leave! Get out of my state!
Kuvira says: You will perish, unless you take my generous offer.
</scene>

<scene>
Kuvira says: It's time to go. We're not wanted here.
Bolin says:  What happened?
Kuvira says: It appears we can't make a deal right now. 
Kai says: Wait! Aren't you guys going to stick around and help?
Kuvira says:  Here's the contract. We'll wait at the border for one day. You get the governor to sign it, and you'll have all the help you need. 
Bolin says:  I guess ... I got to go.
Opal says:  Don't! Please, you can't turn your back on these people!
Bolin says: I'm not! I wanna help, but if the Governor wants us gone, there's ... there's nothing I can do. I'm sorry.  Hey ... Opal, please.
Opal says:  Leave, if that's what you're going to do. 
Kai says: You know, we might not need their help after all. The roads may be impassable, but not the skies. We can use Lefty to fly to all the nearby villages, pick up supplies, and fly back.
Opal says: You're right. We can save this town ourselves.
</scene>

<scene>
Farmer says: Sorry we couldn't give you more. That's all we could spare.
Opal says: Every little bit helps. Because of you and the other farmers around here, we have more than enough food to feed the town until we can get some reinforcements. 
Kai says: Thanks!
Kai says: So ... you and Bolin doing okay?
Opal says:  I don't know. It's really tough having a long distance relationship. And I can't stand that he's working with Kuvira.
Kai says: I can tell. But it does seem like he found his calling, doesn't it? He loves helping people.
Opal says: Maybe. It's just ... he's changed a lot since he's been around her.
Kai says: He's growing up.
Opal says: I just hope we're not growing apart.  Speaking of long-distance relationships, how are you and Jinora doing?
Kai says: Actually, we're doing fine.  You hear that?
Kai says: It's more bandits!
Kai says: We're hooked!
Kai says:  No!

Governor says: What happened? Where's all the food?
Opal says: We were attacked in mid-air. We lost everything.
Kai says: It might be time to make a tough call.

Kai says: For what it's worth, I think you made the right decision.
Governor says:  Did I ever really have a choice?

Mako says:  No!
Lin says: I tried to get you out of it, but it's over my head.  Wu personally asked Raiko. He says he doesn't know what he'd do without you.
Mako says:  This can't be happening! I'm not even an Earth Kingdom citizen; I work for the Republic City Police Department.
Lin says: Not anymore.  You're just a pawn in Raiko's diplomatic game. You can try talking to him, but I don't think he's going to let you quit.

Su and her sons were already on their way to put an end to Kuvira. Meanwhile, Bolin and Varrick learned of Kuvira's true tyrannical intent and deserted her army, but they were captured and betrayed by Zhu Li. Now they're being held against their will!

Wing says: Are you sure this will work? Even without Kuvira, they could still crush us.

Zhu Li says: Don't hurt me!
Suyin says:  Zhu Li?
Kuvira says: I knew you'd try a sneak attack.  You were afraid to step up and lead the Earth Kingdom when you had the chance.  You were afraid to join me when I became the leader, and now, you're afraid of a fair fight.  You've always been a coward. Take them!

Jinora says: Korra, you have to go stop Su before she does something terrible.
Opal says: Stop her, we should be helping her.
Korra says: We have no idea where your mom is, or what her plan is. If we go charging into Kuvira's camp, we could get them all captured, or worse. All we can do now is wait.
Kuvira says: Attention citizens of Zaofu. Your leader, Su Beifong, attempted to attack me tonight while I slept, ignoring the terms of our truce. Luckily, I now have her and her assault team in custody.
Opal says: No.
Kuvira says: Rest assured that I will not take revenge on the peaceful citizens of Zaofu, unless your remaining representatives meet me outside the city at dawn to offer the full and unconditional surrender of your city. That is all.
Opal says: Korra, you can't let Kuvira get away with this! We have to go break out Mom and my brothers!
Jinora says:  You swore an oath of non-aggression when you became an airbender.  You can't just attack Kuvira!
Opal says: I don't care about the oath! I have to save my family!
Korra says:  No, Jinora is right. Your mom attacked the camp. Kuvira was just defending herself.
Opal says:  "Defending herself"? She was going to attack our city! I can't believe you're refusing to fight!
Meelo says:  Why is that loudspeaker lady talking when I'm trying to sleep?
Baatar says: Korra, what are we going to do?
Korra says:  Jinora and I will go talk to Kuvira at dawn, and, maybe, we can work something out. I promise, I'll do everything I can to keep the peace.
Opal says:  I'll go with you.
Ikki says: We'll go, too.
Jinora says: No! Dad told us to find Korra, and we did. Now you need to stay safe.
Ikki says: Come on! Let us help!
Korra says: I can't risk anyone else being captured. You can stay with Baatar and Huan while I work things out with Kuvira.  Make sure they get back to Tenzin if anything goes wrong.

Varrick says: Zhu Li always greeted me in the morning with a  a hot cup of tea.
Baatar Jr. says:  You'll get your tea when you start working.
Varrick says: Well, I'm really only productive for about fifteen minutes a day, usually in the afternoon around three-forty-five.
Baatar Jr. says: You'll work now. I want you to show me how the device works.
Bolin says: What's goin' on?
Baatar Jr. says: Go back to sleep. We only need Varrick. You'll need your energy when you get to the re-education camp.
Varrick says:  I can't be expected to work without an assistant! Without Zhu Li, I'm helpless!
Baatar Jr. says:  One of the guards will be your assistant. I'll be supervising.
Varrick says:  Well, I guess he'll be fine. As long as he doesn't need his hands afterwards! 
Guard #1 says:  What's he talking about, sir?
Varrick says:  The last time we worked with the spirit vines, it created an uncontrollable blast  that burned through a wall and could still be blowing up comets in space, as far as I know! I wouldn't want to assist me if I were you!
Guard #1 says: Maybe we should just let the kid help him out.
Baatar Jr. says:  Fine. Bolin can assist.
Bolin says:  Wait, what? I need my hands!  Uh, hold on! Can we have breakfast first?  While we still have hands?

Suyin says:  Never! I'll never bow to you!
Korra says:  There must be some way for us to resolve this!
Kuvira says: I've already laid out my terms, and I think they're very reasonable. After all, Su did try to take me out during our peaceful negotiations.
Wei says: You call bringing an army to threaten our city "peaceful"?
Opal says:  Where's Bolin? I know he would never go along with this!
Kuvira says: Bolin is with my fiancé, working on something very important.  But, I assure you, he's on board with my plans. You two have been apart for some time. I guess you don't realize how much Bolin has grown up.  Now turn over Zaofu.
Korra says: I can't just let you take the city!
Kuvira says:  Avatar Korra, you are interfering with internal Earth Empire business, and letting your personal feelings get in the way of reason. Zaofu cannot continue to rule itself. They have been hoarding their riches and technology too long. I'm here to distribute those resources fairly throughout the nation. This is about equality.
Opal says: You don't care about equality! This is about control!  Just take her down! You know it's the right thing to do! You have to stop this!
Kuvira says: The only way you're going to keep me from marching into Zaofu is if you physically stop me. Now what are you going to do?
Korra says: It looks like you're not giving me a choice.
Kuvira says:  Fine.  I want you all to know that I would never ask any of you to do something that I'm not willing to do myself.  So, rather than risk your lives, I will fight the Avatar one-on-one.  Korra, if you win, then you can do whatever you want with Zaofu.  But after I beat you, I want you out of my business for good. I'm the one who brought peace to the Earth Empire, not you. You're not relevant here anymore.
Korra says:  Fine.  You wanna fight the Avatar? Then let's finish this, right here, right now.

Jinora says: Are you really ready to fight her?
Korra says: Just stay back and let me handle this.  It's been a while,  but I got a lot of pent-up rage.
Opal says: Don't mess around!  Kuvira is too good! Just go into the Avatar State and get it over with!
Korra says: No, I'm only going to use that as a last resort.
Jinora says:  Be careful.
Kuvira says: Use whatever you want: all the elements; the Avatar State; anything you need.  I know you're a little rusty.
Korra says: Enough talk!
Kuvira says: Looks like the Avatar's a little off her game!
Opal says: Don't let her get you frustrated! She wants you to make a mistake!

Varrick says: Bolin, do the thing.
Bolin says: What thing?
Varrick says:  The thing! I never had to tell Zhu Li what thing!
Bolin says: I'm not Zhu Li, okay? Pretend I don't know anything about anything that's happening here, also pretend I don't want to build a super weapon or get my hands blown off!
Baatar Jr. says: Walk me through what you're doing. I want to know every detail of your work.
Varrick says:  You know, when I started working with the vines,  the point was to find a clean, unlimited source of energy, not develop some spirity death ray.
Bolin says:  Clean energy! Sounds great! Who doesn't like that stuff? Let's do that instead!
Baatar Jr. says:  Quiet! You're here to help, not talk.  And you of all people, should realize that once a discovery is made, it is our responsibility as scientists  to pursue it as far as we can.  Wherever it leads.
Varrick says:  How would you know? You couldn't discover a wolfbat if it was building a nest in your butt.
Baatar Jr. says:  You're pathetic.  Wolfbats don't build nests.
Varrick says:  Ooh. You got me there, Dr. Science. You'll never know how it feels to give birth to genius, only to have it kidnapped, and raised by fools!
Baatar Jr. says: Are you done with your rambling, or do the guards need to encourage you to continue your work? 
Varrick says:  Okay, okay,  The last time we ran the current through the vine  we couldn't control the power, so I'm trying something new to see if I can direct it.
</scene>

<scene>
Kuvira says:  Come on, Avatar, get up! Show me what you've got!
</scene>

<scene>
Opal says: We have to help her!
Korra says:  No! Stay back! I can handle this.
</scene>

<scene>
Baatar Jr. says: So I see how the current interacts with the vine, and here is a kind of directional tube, but that is baffling here at the base. It looks like that would only redirect the energy back where it came from. And what's that piece of equipment you're fiddling with now on the power source?
Varrick says:  Hand me the ... screw-turn-thingy, would ya?
Bolin says: Ugh, I can't believe you're helping them, you know this isn't right. 
Varrick says: Funny story, Bolin. I first got the idea for harnessing spirit power when I watched that giant Unalaq-monster attack the city from my jail cell. That giant monster set me free!  Trust me, kid, I know what I'm doing.  That ought to do it.  Huh.  Okay, stand back.  There we go!
Baatar Jr. says: What's that ticking?
Varrick says: That's the timer.
Baatar Jr. says:  The timer for what?
Varrick says: For the bomb, of course!
Bolin says:  What?! What bomb?
Varrick says:  The bomb that's gonna explode in five minutes and destroy this entire train, all of the spirit vines, and everything else within a few hundred yards.
Varrick says: You know what, I'd get out of here if I were you. This is the first time I've built a timer and it might run a little fast. Bolin and I are ready to go down with the ship, or train, in this case, but you seem like you have a lot to live for.
Bolin says: Nononono! I'm not ready to go down with the ship, or the train!
Baatar Jr. says: You're bluffing.
Varrick says:  Stick around five minutes and you'll find out who's bluffing.  You'll be sorry you left me, Zhu Li! When they write the history books, your name will be synonymous with betrayal! People will say, "Hey, what happened to that guy? Oh, didn't you hear? He 'Varricked' himself because some girl 'Zhu Li'd' him!"
Baatar Jr. says: Enough! What makes you think we would let you blow yourself up? You're working for Kuvira! You don't get to quit.  Grab him.
Varrick says:  You try to pull me away from this thing and I'll hit this remote, and blow it immediately!
Baatar Jr. says: Why do you have a timer and a remote?
Varrick says: Well, first, I built the timer, but then I thought, you could drag me off the train, so then I built a remote, but then I thought, do I really need the timer, because now I got a remote in my--  Whatever! I'm covering all my bases! The point is, you're leaving, we're staying!

Meelo says:  Finally! Let's get it on!

Bolin says: That's everyone, our half of the train is clear.
Varrick says: That's good, we're almost out of time.
Baatar Jr. says:  You're insane.
Varrick says:  You knew that when you hired me! Bolin, do the thing!  Unhook the cars, oh, come on, that was an easy one!
Bolin says: Man, that was great! I gotta admit, you had me going there for a while, I really thought you were gonna blow us up! Now, how do we turn this thing off?
Varrick says: Ooh, we can't turn it off. We're gonna blow up--  --but, we had a pretty good run, right?
Bolin says:  What are you talking about, "a good run"? I'm still running! I like running!
Varrick says:  I'll see you on the other side,  Zhu Li.
Bolin says:  I want you to know,  I hate you.
Baatar Jr. says: I can't believe he actually blew himself up. That man was crazier than a sewer pipe elephant-rat.  Let's get back to Zaofu.

Varrick says: Yes!  You did it, Bolin, you did the thing! 
Bolin says: I can't believe Zhu Li worked for you as long as she did.

Jinora says: We've got her, go!

Baatar Jr. says: Bow to her! Do it! She is your rightful leader!
Baatar says:  I am so disappointed in you, Junior.
Baatar Jr. says:  Take them away! 
Huan says: Get your hands off me! You're crushing my individuality!
Baatar Jr. says: All hail the Great Uniter!

Kuvira says: Are you sure, there's no way they survived?
Baatar Jr. says: Positive. But I think I can replicate his work with the spirit vines and get us back on track. I'll just need an assistant.

Zhu Li says: It would be my honor, Great Uniter.

Shiro Shinobi says:  Korra has reopened the Southern spirit portal and taken the first step to restoring balance between spirits and man. Meanwhile, tensions are high between Korra and her father after she discovered he was hiding a dark secret. Years ago, Tonraq was banished from the North. And now the Northern navy has landed on Southern shores. What other plans does Unalaq have for the Avatar?
</scene>

<scene>
Northern soldier says: Everyone, clear the streets! Get back in your homes.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Uncle, why did you bring your troops down from the North?
Unalaq says: Now that you've opened the Southern portal, we need to protect it from the people who would do the spirits harm.
Korra says:  I can protect it.
Unalaq says: I need you for something more important. There is another portal, in the North. Once you open it, spirits and man will be able to move freely between the North and the South in a matter of seconds.
Korra says: But, the solstice is over. How am I going to open it?
Unalaq says: The spiritual energy is much stronger in the North. And now that you've opened the Southern portal, your energy is stronger as well.
Korra says:  With both portals open, our tribes will be united again.
Unalaq says: The world will be united again.
Tenzin says:  Ahh, I haven't felt this at peace since-  Aaand, it's over.
Bumi says:  Gooood morning, Universe.
Kya says:  Bumi, please, cover yourself.
Bumi says:  Well, lookee here, "Vacation Tenzin" has finally decided to join us.
Tenzin says: Yes, he has.  It's so nice to get to spend more time with my family.  Isn't that right, my little Rohan?  And I've really enjoyed having you two around. Reminds me of all those great vacations we took as kids with Dad.
Kya says: Uhh, I think your memory's a little foggy.  Bumi and I weren't on those great vacations. It was always just you and Dad.
Tenzin says:  No, that can't be right. What about the time he took us to Kyoshi Island to ride the elephant koi?
Kya says: Nope, we weren't there.
Tenzin says: Hmm. Oh, remember Ember Island? Those amazing sand palaces we built on the beach.
Bumi says: You mean, you built? We never saw the place.
Tenzin says: I could've sworn.
</scene>

<scene>
Bumi says: Morning, kids! 
Meelo says: Morning, Uncle Bumi!  Do you have a baby in there? 
Pema says: Where's your sister?
Jinora says: Who?
Pema says: Ikki. About this tall.  Talks real fast. I'm sure you know her.
Jinora says:  Uhh ...
Meelo says: There was a lemur fight, but the bison told us not to worry because a giant was coming. Then we almost got eaten by a shark-squid! 
Bumi says:  The shark-squid? He's here? It appears my old nemesis has found me. 
Pema says:  Jinora, were you and Meelo teasing your sister again?
Jinora says:  I don't know.  Maybe.  Yes.
Meelo says: She ran away.
Pema says:  Honestly, I don't know why you kids can't just get along!
Tenzin says:  It's all right, dear, Ikki couldn't have gone far.,  I'll find her.
Bumi says:  Commander Bumi reporting for duty! Search-and-rescue missions are my specialty.
Kya says:  What do you say we all go together?
Tenzin says: Sure, I could use the help.
Bumi says: When I get back, we'll come out with a plan to take down that shark-squid once and for all!
Meelo says:  Yeah!

Tonraq says: Thank you for coming, everyone. I know these last few days have been very troubling. 
Varrick says:  Troubling? Troubling is when I get that itchy rash that won't go away, and Zhu Li's not around to scratch it. This is shocking.  Nay, sickening! But these kale cookies? Opposite.  Remind me to get the recipe later. 
Tonraq says: What's your point, Varrick?
Varrick says: My point is,  Unalaq's already booted our chieftains out of their palace. How long before he starts telling us what kind of cookies  we can eat?
Zhu Li says: Probably a couple of days.
Varrick says:  Rhetorical question, Zhu Li, you gotta keep up.  Not to mention, I've got a cargo ship full of halibut that's rotting thanks to this harbor lockdown?  Who wants to buy a ship full of stinking fish?  Seriously, it's not rhetorical. I need to sell these fish.
Korra says: Chief Unalaq is here to help the South. He wants to show us how to restore balance with the spirits so they'll stop attacking.
Varrick says: The only spirit I'm interested in restoring is our spirit of independence. Am I right, people? 
Korra says: All Unalaq is trying to do is make our tribes unified again.
Varrick says: No, he wants control of our wealth. My wealth. And I like my wealth. If Unalaq doesn't pull his forces out, then we have no choice but to fight for our freedom! 
Korra says: You want to start a war? Are you crazy?
Tonraq says: Unalaq started this, not us.  I'm sorry, maybe you could speak with your uncle. Tell him how frustrated we all are. He'll listen to what the Avatar has to say. Do it for me?
Korra says: I'll do it for the tribe. 
Varrick says: I cannot stop eating these things.  Look, we all know where this conflict is heading. We need to start preparing for war.

Eska says: I will hate to leave this quaint tribe.
Desna says: Is that true, Eska?
Eska says: Of course not, Desna, I will not miss it at all. I hold immense dislike for the South.  Bolin, laugh at my humorous quip!
Bolin says: Yes, dear.  So-so funny. 
Bolin says:  You know, I'll be really sad when you have to leave. It's been really great getting to know you.  Really.
Eska says: But you will be coming with me to the North. There we will live the rest of our lives together in icy bliss.  Foolish Bolin.
Bolin says:  Mako! I'm so happy to see you! 
Mako says: Uh, you all right, bro?
Bolin says:  No! No, I'm not all right. I can't take anymore. Listen, I don't want to live in icy bliss with Eska!  Don't make me. Oh, please, please don't make me.
Mako says: Uh, hey, if you're that unhappy, just break up with her.
Bolin says: Break up with her? You can do that?
Mako says: Yeah. Guys do that all the time.
Bolin says: How?
Mako says: Just tell her you're not that into her anymore.
Bolin says: Oh, no, no, I don't think she'd like that.
Mako says:  Ending a relationship is kind of like pulling off a blood-sucking leech. You just gotta rip it off and get it over with. You'll feel a lot better afterwards. Trust me.
Bolin says: Thanks, Mako. Whew. I'm lucky you're so good at breaking girls' hearts.  Ha, Korra better watch out.  Oooh, no, it's just a-, uh, you kn-, uh, never mind.
Unalaq says: Our next training sessions isn't until tomorrow.
Korra says: I'm sorry to interrupt. It's about our conversation this morning.
Unalaq says: Yes?
Korra says: I understand why you brought your troops here, but I'm afraid it's sending the wrong message.
Unalaq says: Your father has been talking to you.
Korra says: Not just him. Varrick too. There was a meeting at my parents' house. A lot of Southerners feel like their tribe is being invaded.
Unalaq says: I am their chief. I'm uniting, not invading.
Korra says: I know, but I'm just afraid if something doesn't change, there could be a civil war.
Unalaq says: If the Water Tribes were at war, the other nations would take sides. The dark spirits would thrive off this negative energy, and the world would be thrown into a battle between spirits and man. That would be catastrophic.
Korra says: How do we stop it?
Unalaq says: We? No, Korra.  This is a war only the Avatar can prevent.
Korra says:  I'm usually the one starting fights. I don't know how to stop them from happening.
Unalaq says: As the Avatar, you must remain neutral in this conflict. You will naturally want to help your people, but showing favoritism will not help our tribes finds unity.
Korra says: Maybe Tenzin was right.  Maybe I'm not ready to be the Avatar.
Unalaq says: Tenzin lacked faith in you.  But I have no doubt that you will become the most admired Avatar the world has ever known.
Korra says: Thank you, Uncle.

Northern soldier says: You hoodlums think you're tough, huh?
Southern civilian says: Pick on a waterbender your own size!
Korra says:  Stop!
Southern civilian says: Tell these thugs to go back to the North. They're not welcome here anymore!
Northern soldier says: These Southerners need to stay in line.
Korra says: Everyone, calm down. You're all part of the same tribe, start acting like it.
Southern civilian says:  You're taking their side? We thought you were one of us.
Korra says:  I'm not taking anyone's side.  Hey!
Little girl says: You're the worst Avatar ever!
Tonraq says: Everyone, walk away from this. They're not worth our trouble. Go back to your homes.
Tonraq says: Korra, I-  Korra!

Tenzin says: Ikki! Ikki! Ikki? Ikki, where are you?
Bumi says:  Over here, Dad!  Just kidding. It's me!
Kya says: There's no sign of her anywhere.
Tenzin says: Why would Ikki run off like this? Ah, it's probably my fault.
Kya says:  Probably.
Tenzin says: Excuse me?
Kya says: I'm guessing you've been so busy with your  "duty" to Republic City that you forgot about your duty to your kids.
Bumi says:  "Duty."
Kya says:  What are you, five years old?
Tenzin says: Kya, you're right. I haven't been spending enough time with them. I wish I could be as good a father as Dad was to us.
Kya says: Tenzin, your problem is you're exactly like Dad. He was so focused on saving the world and doing his duty,  don't laugh, that he never had time for us.
Tenzin says: Dad was under a lot of pressure.
Bumi says: He always had time for you, though,  his precious little airbender.
Tenzin says:  Dad loved us all equally. Besides, it all happened a long time ago. Why are we even talking about this?
Kya says: Because you seem to have some grandiose delusion that we had a perfect, happy-go-lucky childhood. Guess what. We didn't!
Tenzin says: We need to keep moving if we want to find Ikki before dark.
Kya says:  See what he's doing there, Bumi? Classic airbender technique. Cutting and running when things get tough!
Tenzin says: Uch.
Bumi says:  Yeah. Did Dad teach you that move?

Mako says: How was your day, sweetie?
Korra says:  Oh, fabulous.  My tribe's about to go to war, and I'm supposed to stop it, but will anyone listen to me? No! And I didn't ask for my father's help. Can't he just let me be the Avatar?
Mako says: Uh, do you want advice, or am I just supposed to listen? I'm still not clear on that.
Korra says: Ugh. I'm sorry. My dad just gets me all worked up.
Mako says: How about you take a break from all this Avatar stuff, and we go out for a quiet dinner. Just the two of us.
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says:  Isn't this fun, huh? We never get to spend enough time together, just the ... five of us. So fun.
Eska says: Excuse us while we retrieve more sustenance. 
Bolin says: You guys gotta save me.
Mako says: I though you were breaking up with her. What happened to "ripping off the leech"?
Bolin says: I tried! But anytime I bring up the subject, she threatens to freeze me in a block of ice and feed me to dolphin piranhas!
Mako says: So it was more like you tugged at the leech.
Bolin says: Yes, over and over and over, but it won't come off. Why didn't you warn me your cousin had the power to reach into my heart and crush my soul with her bare hands.
Korra says: Uh, 'cause I thought it was pretty obvious?
Bolin says: No, no, not to me it wasn't. I'm very bad at reading people. You should know that by now.  Oh, man. Oh! Do something, Avatar!
</scene>

Bumi says: You know, this reminds me of a search-and-rescue mission I commanded years ago in the mountains outside of Ba Sing Se.
Tenzin says:  Here we go.
Bumi says: For five days we scoured the beast of a mountain, fighting our ways through blizzards, sandstorms, and three typhoons. Finally, we found the men huddled in a cave, seconds from death. With no time to lose, I piled all twelve of those poor souls on my back and single-handedly carried them down the mountain to safety.
Tenzin says:  And how exactly is that supposed to help us find Ikki?
Bumi says: It was supposed to inspire you. Clearly, you know nothing about being a leader of men. That's probably why the Avatar fired you.
Tenzin says: I'm sick of your far-fetched tales. Three typhoons?
Bumi says: Well, I may have thrown in an extra typhoon or two for dramatic effect, but-
Kya says: Quit arguing and bring that lantern over here. I found footprints.
Tenzin says: Come on! 
Bumi says: No, follow me! This will get us down fifty times faster. 
Kya says: Bumi, it's pitch black and the rocks are slippery. You're going to hurt yourself.
Bumi says: Come on, you wimps! If I can do it, it should be no problem for a couple of benders.
Kya says: Fine.
Kya says:  You were right, Bumi! That was faster!
Tenzin says: At least fifty times faster, by my calculations. 
Bumi says:  Oh, so Tenzin's the funny guy now.
Tenzin says: If you need an airlift down, just say the word.
Bumi says: Bah, I don't need your help. I've got everything under control.  Agh!
Tenzin says:  Bumi!

Korra says: Did Dad send you to talk to me?
Senna says: Your father doesn't know I'm here.  Korra, what's going on between you two?
Korra says: Ask Dad. 
Senna says: I've tried, but he won't talk about it. Honey, it breaks my heart to see our family being torn apart like this.
Korra says: You want to know what's been going on? I found out Dad's been lying to me my whole life. Unalaq told me everything; how Dad and Tenzin kept me trapped down here while I trained; how Dad got banished from the North.
Senna says: So, the truth is out.
Korra says: You knew? And you never said anything.
Senna says: We were trying to keep our family together, to give you a normal childhood.
Korra says: I never wanted a normal childhood. All I ever wanted to be was the Avatar. But everyone keeps holding me back, even my own parents! Unalaq's the only one who believes in me.
Senna says: That's not true, Korra.
Korra says: No? Then why is everyone in the South turning against me, when all I'm trying to do is help them?
Senna says: The problems between the North and the South started long before you were born. You can't expect to undo them in a day.
Korra says: So I should just sit back and let the Water Tribes go to war?
Senna says: No, but this situation might be out of your control. Varrick's been plotting a rebellion against Unalaq. He asked your father to join, and-
Korra says:  Dad is part of a rebellion?
Senna says: I don't know, but I don't want you getting caught in the middle of it.
Korra says: It's too late, Mom. I'm already in the middle of it. 
Senna says:  Korra!

Korra says: Uncle!  Oh, no. Uncle?  Dad?  Dad, don't do this.
Rebel says: Turn around, Avatar, and pretend you didn't see anything.
Korra says: No. Leave Unalaq and go. I'll tell him I tried to stop you, but you escaped. We can still avoid a war.
Rebel says: No, we can't.
Rebel says: Get him out of here!
Korra says: We're all part of the same tribe. I don't wanna hurt you.
Korra says: Dad, stop!  Why did you do this, Dad?  What? Who are you? Where's my father?
Rebel leader says: He wouldn't help us. He's a traitor, just like you.

Unalaq says: Thank you for saving my life.
Korra says: I'm just glad I got here in time.
Unalaq says: Find Varrick. I want him to freeze in prison with the rest of these traitors. 
Korra says: Wait, you can't just lock them away. That will only make the South angrier.
Unalaq says: You want them to go free?
Korra says: No. But let them stand trial for what they did. Every Water Tribe citizen deserves that right.
Unalaq says:  Very well. I will respect the Avatar's wishes in this matter.
Korra says:  Thank you, Uncle.

Kya says: I told you those rocks were slippery. You're lucky you didn't kill yourself.
Bumi says: You done with the lecture, Mom?
Kya says: Oh, grow up! You haven't changed one bit since we were kids. You're still trying to prove you can do everything a bender can. Well, you can't. Deal with it.
Bumi says: And you're not our mother. You don't get to tell me what I can and can't do. Deal with that.  Ugh.
Kya says: Good luck healing yourself with your special nonbending powers.
Bumi says:  Hey, hey, back me up here, Tenzin.
Tenzin says: Kya's right. You're the oldest of us, but you always acted like the youngest. I had to become the responsible one.
Kya says: You think you're the responsible one?  Where were you after Dad died and Mom was all alone? Because I was the only one who packed up and moved my whole life to be with her.
Tenzin says: Sure, after years of flitting around the world, trying to find yourself. It was time for you to settle down somewhere.  You two have no idea how it feels to have the future of an entire culture on your shoulders.
Bumi says:  Oh, boo-hoo. Must've been real hard for you, flying around the world with Dad, riding elephant koi all day.
Tenzin says: Oh, so that's what this is all about.
Kya says: That's what it's always been about. You think you're some savior who has to carry on Dad's legacy.
Tenzin says: Who else is going to do it?
Kya says: How about all of us?
Bumi says: Yeah, we're Aang's kids too.
Kya says: We never should have come on this vacation.
Bumi says: I couldn't agree more.
Tenzin says:  Well, I didn't want you to come in the first place. I can't be around you two right now. Go back to the temple and see if Ikki returned. I'll keep looking out here.
Bumi says:  Fine.
Kya says:  Fine.
Tenzin says: Fine.

Korra says: Is it okay if I come in?
Senna says: Of course. We heard what happened. Are you okay?
Korra says:  I'm so glad you weren't there. I don't know what I would've done.
Tonraq says: I had no idea how far Varrick was willing to go. My brother and I have our differences, but I would never attack him.
Korra says: I'm sorry for thinking you had anything to do with the rebels. And for all the pain I've caused you and Mom.
Tonraq says: I'm the one who should apologize. After I saw the Southern Lights return, I was so proud of you. I never should've held you back.
Senna says: When your father and I found each other, all we wanted was to live a simple life and raise a family. But, then we discovered you were the Avatar, and simple was over. We knew one day the world would need you, and you wouldn't need us anymore.
Korra says: Mom, Dad,  of course I still need you.
Tonraq says:  We weren't expecting you.
Unalaq says:  Tonraq, Senna, you are under arrest and will stand trial.
Tonraq says: Trial? For what?
Unalaq says: For conspiring to assassinate me.

Shiro Shinobi says:  Love is in the air! Since Avatar Korra has arrived in Republic City she's only had eyes for one fellow: Mako. The feeling seemed mutual until a fateful accident intervened. Now Mako's affections have fallen right into the arms of the beautiful Asami. Will love prove to be Korra's most formidable foe yet?
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says:  It's been great having you at so many back-to-back practices, Korra.
Korra says:  Feels good to be back, although  Tarrlok isn't too happy about my leave of absence.
Bolin says: Hey, you joined the Fire Ferrets before you joined his task force.
Mako says: Okay, come on, team huddle time!
Mako says: It's our first match of the tournament tonight. I know the three of us haven't been a team for very long, but even so, the Fire Ferrets have never been this good. Are we ready?
Korra and Bolin says: We're ready!
Asami says:  Not quite, you'll need these. 
Mako says: Hey, Asami.
Asami says: Good morning, sweetie.
Mako says: These new uniforms look great!
Asami says: You look great, champ!
Mako says: Well, teammates, I'll see you before the match tonight. Asami and I have a lunch date.
Bolin says:  Okay, we'll check you guys later, you know, we'll see you when we see ya.
Bolin says:  So, Korra. There they go, here we are, all alone in the gym, just you and me, two alone people. Together. Alone.
Korra says: Ah, I gotta head back to the air temple to train with Tenzin. See ya!
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: Work with me here, Pabu! You wanna look spic and span in your new uniform, don't you?  So, what do you think of Korra, in a "girlfriend" sort of way?
Mako says: She's great! But I think it makes more sense for me to go for Asami.
Bolin says:  I was talking about a girlfriend for me! Leave some ladies for the rest of us!
Mako says: I know, that's what I thought you meant.
Bolin says: Well ...?
Mako says: I don't know, Bo. It doesn't seem like a good idea for you to date Korra.
Bolin says: You just said she was great two seconds ago.
Mako says: Yeah, Korra is a great athlete and the Avatar and stuff, but I don't know if she's really "girlfriend material". She's more like a pal.
Bolin says: Bro, you're nuts! Korra and I are perfect for each other: she's strong, I'm strong; she's fun, I'm fun; she's beautiful, I'm gorgeous! Okay, I don't care what you think, I'm gonna ask Korra out.
Mako says: Look, it just isn't smart to date a teammate, especially during the tournament. Keep your head out of the clouds and your priorities straight, okay?
Bolin says: Yeah, yeah, I know, gah.  You know what I'm talking about, Pabu, I'm talking about real love. 
</scene>

<scene>
Jinora says: So, how's it going with the tall, dreamy firebender boy? You've been spending a lot of time together lately.
Ikki says: Oooh, yeah! Tell us all about the magical romance.
Korra says: What?  Listen to you two, I-I'm not interested in Mako or any romantic stuff.  Besides he's all into that prissy, beautiful, elegant, rich girl ... but let's just pretend for a second I am interested in him. What would I do?
Jinora says: Ooh! I just read a historical saga where the heroine fell in love with the enemy general's son, who's supposed to marry the princess. You should do what she did!
Korra says:  Tell me!
Jinora says: She rode a dragon into battle and burned down the entire country.  Then she jumped into a volcano. It was so romantic!
Korra says: Uhh ...
Ikki says: No, no, no!  The best way to win a boy's heart is to brew a love potion of rainbows and sunsets that makes true lovers sprout wings and fly into a magical castle in the sky, where they get married and eat clouds with spoons and use stars as ice cubes in their moonlight punch. Forever and ever and ever! 
Korra says: The volcano is starting to make more sense to me now. 
Korra says:  Oh, hey Pema. Uh, how long were you standing there?
Pema says: Long enough. But trust me, I know what you're going through. Years ago I was in the exact the same situation, with Tenzin.
Ikki says:  Daddy was in love with someone else before you?
Pema says: That's right.
Korra says: So what did you do?
Pema says: Well, for the longest time, I did nothing. I was so shy and scared of rejection, but watching my soul mate spend his life with the wrong woman became too painful. So I hung my chin out there and I confessed my love to Tenzin. And the rest is history.
Korra, Ikki, and Jinora says: Wooow!

Shiro Shinobi says: Folks, after a year of waiting the Pro-bending Championship is finally here. Tonight is the first set of matches in our single elimination sixteen team bracket. And I gotta tell ya, these are the most tenacious and talented bending trios this arena has ever seen.
Ring announcer says: Introducing our first team, the Future Industries Fire Ferrets!  And their opponents, the Red Sands Rabaroos!
Shiro Shinobi says: What an explosive opening volley. Both teams quickly recover and unleash a barrage of bending. I am astonished with the level of improvement displayed here by the Fire Ferrets. No wonder the Avatar has been absent from the papers lately. She's obviously had her nose to the grindstone in the gym. The Ferrets advance into Rabaroo territory and are holding nothing back. Nice sprawl there by Mako. Bolin strikes, Ula dodges, and all three Rabaroos are down. The Fire Ferrets easily take round one!
Ring announcer says: Round two!
Shiro Shinobi says: The Rabaroos are looking for payback and they go straight after Bolin. Korra comes to his defense and water-whacks Umi back into zone two! The Ferrets are on fire tonight and they win round two.
Ring announcer says: Round three!
Shiro Shinobi says: With the Rabaroos down two rounds they'll need a knockout to win, and with the way the Fire Ferrets are playing I don't see that happening. These Ferrets are working together like a well-oiled bending machine. Bolin passes Adi back into zone two and the Ferrets get the green light to advance. The Rabaroos are just fighting to stay at their feet at this point. Out goes Adi, and Ula, and Umi!
Ring announcer says: All three rounds go to the Future Industries Fire Ferrets to win the opening match of the tournament!
Bolin says:  That's what I'm talking about!  Thank you, thank you very much! Thank you all you fans!
Mako says:  Wow, we were really connecting out there in that ring.
Korra says: Yeah! You know, I feel like the two of us have been connecting really well out of the ring, too.
Mako says: Uh, sure.
Korra says: So, I was thinking we should spend some time together.
Mako says: Oh, we've been spending lots of time together.
Korra says: I mean outside of the gym, and not while searching for kidnapped family members or fighting chi blockers.
Mako says: I don't know. Asami and I have —
Korra says:  Look, I really like you and I think we are meant for each other! 
Mako says:  Korra, I'm really sorry, but I just don't feel the same way about you.
Korra says: Forget I ever said anything ...
Asami says:  Congratulations, guys! You were so amazing out there. 
Bolin says: So, Korra, I was thinking, you and me, we could get some dinner together, sort of a date situation.
Korra says: Oh, that's really sweet, but I don't think so. I don't feel very date-worthy.
Bolin says: Are you kidding me? You're the smartest, funniest, toughest, buffest, talentedest, incrediblest girl in the world!
Korra says:  You really feel that way about me?
Bolin says: I felt that way since the moment I saw you! Trust me, I know we're gonna have so much fun together.
Korra says:  You know what? I could use some fun. Okay, sure!
Bolin says: Yes! Who's the luckiest guy in the world? Right here, Bolin!
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says:  So, how do you like it?
Korra says:  Hmm, it's delicious and totally authentic! I didn't realize how much I missed Water Tribe grub.
Bolin says:  That's great, 'cause this is my favorite joint. See? You love Water Tribe food, I love Water Tribe food, just another reason we are so great together.
Korra says:  They are good noodles! Hey, who's that creepy guy over there who keeps glaring at us?
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: That's Tahno and the Wolfbats, the reigning champs, three years running. Don't make eye contact.
Bolin says: Uh-oh, here he comes. Now don't mess with this guy, he's a nasty dude. 
Tahno says:  Well, well, well, if it isn't the Fire Ferrets. Pro-bending's saddest excuse for a team. Tell me, how did a couple of amateurs like you luck your way into the tournament? Especially you, Avatar. You know, if you'd like to learn how a real pro bends, I could give you some private lessons.
Korra says:  You wanna go toe-to-toe with me, pretty boy?
Tahno says: Go for it. I'll give you the first shot. 
Bolin says:  Korra, don't. He's just trying to bait you. If you hit him, we're out of the tournament.
Bolin says: Whoa, ho, ho, I've never seen someone harass Tahno like that. You are one of a kind, Korra.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says:  What kind of game are you playing?
Korra says:  Uh ... Pro-bending? We've got the quarterfinal match.
Mako says: No, I mean with Bolin. You've got him all in a tizzy and I know you're only using him to get back at me.
Korra says: I am not, we're just having fun together. What do you care, anyway?
Mako says:  I'm looking out for my little brother. I don't want to see his heart get broken.
Korra says: Wait a second ... you're not worried about him, you're jealous! You do have feelings for me!
Mako says: What? Jealous? Don't be ridiculous.
Korra says: Admit it! You like me.
Mako says: No, I'm with Asami.
Korra says: Yeah, but when you're with her you're thinking about me, aren't you?
Mako says:  Get over yourself!
Korra says:  I'm just being honest.
Mako says: You're crazy!
Korra says: You're a liar! 
Random stranger says: Hey Mako-! Oh ... 
</scene>

Shiro Shinobi says: Eight teams have been eliminated and eight advance into the quarter finals, which get underway way tonight. The rookies are about to take on the former and longest-reigning champs, the Boar-q-pines. Youth clashes against experience in a battle for the ages, or rather of the ages.  Korra dodges and, ooh, slams right into her teammate! Down goes Mako and Bolin and Korra!
Ring announcer says: Round one goes to the Boar-q-pines!
Mako says:  You were supposed to defend while I attacked!
Korra says: I had an opening so I took it!
Bolin says: What is up with you two? All right, whatever, just pull together, guys.
Shiro Shinobi says: The Ferrets looking to mount some offense here in round two. Bolin lets fly a flurry of attacks, he's a one-man bending battalion. The Ferrets are having a rough time finding their rhythm tonight, but thanks to Bolin, they narrowly notch round two. Not sure what's eating them, but this is not the same team who took out the Rabaroos.
Ring announcer says: Round three is a tie! We go to a tie-breaker to decide the match.
Referee says: The Fire Ferrets win the coin toss!  Which element do you choose?
Mako says: I got this.
Bolin says: I know you usually handle these, but frankly, your head's not in the game. I'm gonna take this one.  We choose earth.
Shiro Shinobi says:  Looks like the earthbenders will collide in the tie-breaker face-off. Bolin goes in for the grapple, Chang reverses. Bolin strikes from midair, knocking Chang to the edge of the circle. Another strike from Bolin, and Chang is in the drink!
Ring announcer says: The Future Industries Fire Ferrets win their quarterfinal match! 
Shiro Shinobi says: Oh, that was a close one folks! Youth trumps experience tonight.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: We need to talk. Look, sometimes you can be so infuriating. But I —
Korra says: Save your breath. You've already made it clear how you feel about me.
Mako says: No, I haven't. What I'm trying to say is: as much as you drive me crazy, I also think you're pretty amazing.
Korra says: So you do like me?
Mako says: Yes, but, I like Asami, too. I don't know, things are complicated. I've been feeling really confused and —
Mako says: Bolin, this isn't what you think!  Great, look at what you did!
Korra says:  You're blaming me?
Mako says:  You kissed me!
Korra says:  You kissed me back!
Korra says:  Well played, Korra.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Morning, Narook. My brother here?  Thanks.  Come on. Wake up. Taking you home, bro.
Bolin says:  Don't call me that. You're not my brother! You're a brother betrayer!  The only one I can trust anymore is Pabu! Pabu loves me. 
Mako says: You're a mess, and we've got the biggest match of our lives tonight. Let's go. 
Bolin says:  No! I'm not going anywhere with you, you traitor! 
Mako says: Guess we'll have to do this the hard way. 
Bolin says:  Why?
Mako says: Told you dating a teammate was a bad idea.
Bolin says: You're a bad idea! Put me down! Put me down!
</scene>

<scene>
Shiro Shinobi says: You can't find two teams more evenly matched in age, size, and strength than the Fire Ferrets and the Buzzard Wasps. Believe me, I've looked! This should be a pulse-pounding semifinal, folks!  The Buzzard Wasps open with a flawlessly executed combo. All three Ferrets take an early visit to zone two. And Mako is knocked all the way back into zone three! The Fire Ferrets have been struggling to stay alive since the opening bell. All three players are totally out of sync tonight.  Ooh, that has got to sting!  And Bolin loses his noodles! Literally.  Which reminds me, this match is brought to you by our sponsor, Flameo Instant Noodles! Noodliest noodles in the United Republic.  The Buzzard Wasps fly deeper into Ferret territory. And Mako plunges into the pool! Can the Fire Ferrets hold on? The Wasps have the Ferrets backed up to the edge now ... and the Ferrets are bailed out by the bell! They had better pull themselves together for round two, otherwise they can kiss the finals goodbye.
Bolin says:  Hey! Watch it! 
Shiro Shinobi says: The Wasps take advantage of Mako's unforced error and Bolin is in the pool!  Ooh, and a blatant hold by the Avatar!
Referee says:  Unnecessary roughness! Move back one zone!
Korra says: I'll unnecessarily rough you up! 
Shiro Shinobi says: And the Avatar is slapped with the yellow fan. The Ferrets are their own worst enemy right now. It's just sad to watch. With the Buzzard Wasps leading two rounds to zilch, the Ferrets' only hope of winning is with a knockout.
Mako says: Well, I guess there's always next year.
Korra says: Come on! We still have a chance, even if it is a slim one!
Bolin says: The way we're playing, we don't even deserve to be in the finals.
Korra says: Look, if we don't pull together and work as a team, we'll never forgive ourselves.
Mako says: Let's just get this over with.
Bolin says: The sooner, the better.
Shiro Shinobi says: Bolin's knocked into zone two, followed quickly by his brother!  And Bolin takes a zinger to the shoulder! Looks like it's a clean hit.
Bolin says: Owww!
Mako says: Bolin! 
Shiro Shinobi says: Mako's in the drink and out of the match. And Bolin keeps playing with one good arm! I gotta hand it to him, this kid's got grit! But how long can he keep it up?  Apparently, not very long. The Ferrets' dream of making it to the finals now rests in the Avatar's hands. But with three on one, I don't like her odds. 
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Are you okay? How's your shoulder?
Bolin says: Ahh, it's messed up pretty bad. But I think I'll be all right.  Are we gonna be all right?
Mako says: Of course we are. We're brothers. We'll get through this mess. I'm sorry.
Bolin says: Me too! Girls ...
Mako says: Seriously.
Shiro Shinobi says: What an unbelievable effort here by Korra! She's dodging every element the Wasps throw at her!  The Avatar finally gains some ground, but with only ten seconds remaining, it might be too little too late!  It's the big kibosh! What a knockout!
Bolin says:  Yes! She did it!
Mako says:  Yes! Yeah!
Shiro Shinobi says: It didn't seem possible, folks, but the Fire Ferrets are headed to the finals!
Bolin says: Ha, ha!  Shoulder! Shoulder!
Mako says:  Sorry.
Bolin says:  That, was pretty much the coolest thing I've ever seen.
Mako says: Thanks for not giving up on us. We never would have made it this far without you. I owe you. Big time.
Korra says: You're welcome. So ... I know things are confusing right now, but I hope we can still be friends.
Mako says: Definitely.
</scene>

<scene>
Tahno says:  Ooh, oof. You boys smell something in here? Wait, I know what that is; yeah, that's the scent of losers.
Korra says:  I hope we see you in the finals. Then we'll know who the losers really are.
Tahno says:  Yeah, I'm peeing my pants over here.
Ring announcer says: And now, the defending champs, the White Falls Wolfbats!
Asami says: Great job!  What a comeback, Korra. I've never seen a hat trick like that.
Korra says: Thanks!  But, if it hadn't been for you and your father, we wouldn't have had the chance to play. So thank you.
Bolin says: Uh, if everyone's done with the little "thank you" party, need some medical attention over here.
Korra says: Ooh, let me help! 
Bolin says:  Owww! Gah! Haven't you hurt me enough, woman?
Korra says: Relax, I'm a healer!  I learned from Katara, the best there is.
Bolin says: No, no, oh- ooh! That's the stuff!
Korra says: Bolin, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. I didn't mean to let things get so out of hand.
Bolin says: Ahh, I'll be all right. But we had fun together, didn't we?
Korra says: I had a great time, honestly! You are one of a kind, Bolin.
Bolin says: Please, go on. I enjoy praise.
Ring announcer says: Your winners, the Wolfbats!
Korra says: What? How is it over already?
Shiro Shinobi says: With a brutal round one knockout, the defending champs secure their spot in the finals.  I hope the Ferrets know a good doctor, 'cause they're gonna need one!

Shiro Shinobi says:  Amon's revolution grows stronger by the day. First, he attacked the bending arena! Then it was discovered that Hiroshi Sato was the mastermind behind the Equalist gloves and mecha tanks! And most recently, Amon ambushed Councilman Tarrlok, took his bending, and nearly captured the Avatar as well! Everyone is on edge, wondering where will Amon strike next?

Jinora says:  Daddy, you're home. We waited up for you. Is Korra okay?
Tenzin says: Yes, she's fine, sweetie. 
Ikki says: I was scared. I thought she wasn't coming back.
Tenzin says:  I'm sorry you were scared, but everything is going to be fine now. I promise.
Korra says: Mmm. Mmm. The food tastes amazing, Pema. I'm finally starting to feel like myself again.
Pema says:  We're so thankful you're home safe.
Asami says:  Let me help.
Tenzin says: Korra, I realize you've been through a lot, but I need to know everything that happened.
Korra says: Well, first off, Tarrlok isn't who he says he is. He's Yakone's son. 
Lin says: It all makes sense now. That's how Tarrlok was able to bloodbend us without a full moon.
Tenzin says: But how did you escape? And where's Tarrlok?
Korra says: Amon captured him,  and took his bending.
Tenzin says:  What?
Korra says: Yeah, he showed up out of nowhere. He almost got me, too.
Tenzin says: This is very disturbing news. Amon is becoming emboldened. Taking out a councilman, almost capturing the Avatar ... I fear Amon is entering his endgame.

Asami says:  Pema, are you all right?
Pema says: The baby is ... just kicking, really hard, is all. I'm fine.
Asami says:  Should I get Tenzin?
Pema says: No reason to worry him, it's nothing.
Mako says: Can I get some hot water? Korra needs more tea.
Asami says:  You're a firebender. Boil it yourself.
Pema says:  I'm- gonna step out in case you two want to talk. 
Mako says:  Is there something we need to talk about?
Asami says: I've noticed how you treat Korra. How you acted when she was missing.  You have feelings for her, don't you?
Mako says:  What? No! She was taken by a crazy bloodbender! How did you expect me to act?
Asami says:  I like Korra.  But you've been keeping the truth from me this whole time.
Mako says:  The truth? About what?
Asami says:  You're really going to make me say it?
Mako says: Yes! Because I don't know what you're talking about!
Asami says: The kiss, Mako.  I know.
Mako says:  I- Well I-  Bolin told you, didn't he?!
Asami says:  Don't blame your brother for what you did. Do you have feelings for Korra or not?
Mako says: Look, things are crazy right now. Can we deal with our relationship problems later? 
Asami says:  Well there might not be any relationship to worry about later.

Tenzin says: Pema! Ye- yes- yes, Lin has agreed to help out around here and keep an eye on things while I'm away.
Pema says: Thank you! I could use the extra pair of hands.  Would you mind giving him a bath? He's filthy.

Bolin says: All things considered you did a great job!  But how are we going to pay for all these parking tickets?
Mako says:  Relax, the city is under attack. The police have more important things to worry about.
Asami says:  This'll come in handy.  Why don't you sit in back? With Korra.

Meelo says:  A brother? Well it's about time!
Ikki says:  Welcome, I'm Ikki, and this is Jinora and Meelo. We have a super great family and we're so happy that you're a part of it.
Jinora says: What're you gonna name him?  Can I pick?
Pema says: We already chose a name. 
Tenzin says: Rohan.

Ikki says:  Everything's not gonna be fine, is it, Daddy?
Korra says: What do you want to do, Tenzin?
Tenzin says:  I need to protect my family, and get them as far away from this conflict as possible. If Amon got his hands on my children ... I hate to even think of it.
Lin says: If you're leaving, then I'm going with you.
Tenzin says: But-
Lin says: No arguments. You and your family are the last airbenders. There's no way in the world I'm letting Amon take your bending away.
Tenzin says: Thank you, Lin. Korra, I want you to leave this island and hide for the time being.
Korra says:  I'm not giving up.
Tenzin says: I'm not asking you to. I sent word to the United Forces. They will be here soon. And once my family is safe, I will return. With the reinforcements, we can turn the tide in this war.
Korra says: What you're saying is, we need to be patient. 
Tenzin says:  You're learning well.  Stay safe, Korra.
Korra says: You too.
Lin says: Tenzin, if we're leaving, we'd better do it now.
Tenzin says:  Oogi, yip yip!
White Lotus sentry #1 says: Go! We'll hold them off!
Korra says:  Everyone, climb on!  Let's go, girl!

Shiro Shinobi says:  Zaheer infiltrated Zaofu and attempted to kidnap the Avatar. After a harrowing battle, she was saved and discovered a shocking truth: Aiwei, Su's trusted adviser, has been working with Zaheer. This truth seer turned traitor managed to escape but Su tasks Team Avatar of tracking him down. Now the hunted becomes the hunter as Korra searches for answers.

Korra says: Aiwei has definitely been through here.  Nice tracking, girl.
Mako says: Let's ask around. Maybe someone's seen him.

Bolin says:  Ohh look, they have a mover poster of me.  Must be big Nuktuk fans,  yeah,  I should go out and say hello ...
Mako says:  No. Those are wanted posters,  and there's one for each of us. "Wanted by Her Majesty, the Earth Queen, for crimes against the Kingdom."  I'm guessing this is because we took her airbenders.
Korra says:  They weren't hers to keep! I swear, if I see her pinchy  little queen face again, I am going to ...
Asami says:  Uhh, guys ...  We should get out of here.
</scene>

Lin says: Where's everyone? I've been waiting to leave for half an hour.
Suyin says: And good morning to you, Lin. Now don't get mad, Korra's fine. I'm just waiting to hear if she'd tracked down Aiwei yet.
Lin says:  What! You let Korra go?! I thought we were on the same page about this, and then you go and stab me in the back?
Suyin says: Oh, don't be so overdramatic. You can't control the Avatar's every move.
Lin says:  I can try.
</scene>

Korra says: Naga found something.  Oh ... Sorry, I forgot to bring treats  but, good girl.
Asami says:  This must be Aiwei's jeep. He can't be far.
Mako says:  Bolin and I  will investigate the Misty Palms Oasis, and see if he's hold up there.
Bolin says: Yes!  I love it when you talk like a cop.
Korra says: I'm coming too.
Mako says: No. You and Asami wait here in case he comes back. Besides, we don't want to call too much attention to ourselves.
Korra says:  All right.
Bolin says:  Ooh, Mako, Mako, Mako! We should wear disguises and pretend we're going undercover! That way,  no one will recognize us. Haha, police work is so exciting!
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says:  All right, now we need our undercover identities!  I'm an ex-United Forces operative named Ting-Ting. War was the only woman I ever loved, until Ivy came along and showed me what real love is. Tragically, she was taken from me by my archenemy Dr. Razor and -
Mako says:  Enough!  Let's just find Aiwei.
Bolin says: But I haven't even told your backstory.
Mako says:  I'm a cop. I don't have a backstory.
Bolin says:  Uh! You're good at this.

Tavern owner says: Shoo! Human customers only.
Mako says: Let's see if this guy knows anything.  Excuse me, sir? We're looking for a man about sixty, balding, wearing glasses in a long green robe.
Bolin says: And he's got this weird piercing that goes from his nose  to his  ear. Freaks me out.
Tavern owner says: Yeah, sure. Sounds like a guy who came in last night. I told him I had the best drinks in the Earth Kingdom and he called me a liar.
Mako says:  That's him! Any idea where he is now?
Tavern owner says:  Nah, afraid not. But he was right.  My drinks are terrible.

Asami says: Are you okay?
Korra says:  I'm just frustrated. What does Zaheer want with me? What's his plan?
</scene>

<scene>
Asami says: I don't know. But I think I found a clue. 
Korra says:  Xai Bau's Grove, sundown. This must be where and when Aiwei's going to meet Zaheer!
Asami says:  All right. Xai Bau's Grove, where are you?  Go away! I'm trying to find something.
Bolin says:  Well, aren't you a cute little spir-  Ow! Hey! 
Mako says:  No luck here.
Bolin says:  I think there might be a couple bounty hunters over there who recognize me!
Mako says: We've been made. Let's lose 'em!
Mako says: Okay, I think we're clear. We should head back to Korra before someone else recognizes us.
Bolin says: We could, or ... we could follow Aiwei instead.  Look!
Mako says: All right.  Stay cool and follow my lead.
Bolin says:  Ting-Ting always finds his man.
Mako says: Keep an eye on him. I'll go get Korra.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: We found Aiwei hiding in an inn.
Korra says: That's great!
Asami says: We found something too.  It looks like he's gonna meet Zaheer at sundown at a place called Xai Bau's Grove. But I can't find it anywhere on the map.
Korra says: Let's go bust down Aiwei's door and finally get some answers.
Mako says: No. Once Aiwei knows we're onto him, we lose our advantage. I say we stake out his room and when he leaves for this meeting, we follow him.
Korra says:  And he'll lead us straight to Zaheer.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says:  Good afternoon. We'd like a room on the ground floor, across from 102, please.
Innkeeper says: Forget it! Last time a bunch of teenagers came in here, they trashed the whole room. 
Macao says:  We found you! 
Innkeeper says: Hey, no bending in here! Take it outside!
Macao says:  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not here to fight you.  We're here to meet Nuktuk!
Lily says:  We're your biggest fans. Can you make it out to Lily and Macao?
Bolin says: Uh, I'd be happy to. Always love meeting my fans. 
Lily says:  I made this Nuktuk doll for you.
Bolin says:  Uh, it's ... cute. 
Innkeeper says: Why didn't you tell me your friend was a mover star? I'd be happy to rent you any room in the inn.
Mako says: We'll just take the one across from 102.
Innkeeper says: But that room is too small for the four of you!
Mako says: Trust me, it'll be perfect.
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: I'd just like to say, for the record, this room is definitely not perfect.  Naga! 
Korra says: There he is.
Bolin says: I thought stakeouts were supposed to be exciting. This isn't. At all!  Ooh, I wonder if there's any snacks in here.  Hey, look! A Pai Sho board! Mako, you want to play?
Mako says: Kind of busy here, bro.
Asami says: I'll play.
Bolin says: Oh, well, ugh, no offense but I learned street Pai Sho from Shady Shin, and I'm pretty good. So, wouldn't really be a fair game.
Asami says: So? I learned to play from my dad, the diabolical genius. I'll destroy you.
Bolin says: Well, looks we've got ourselves a Pai-Shodown.  Ladies first.  Uh, I don't mean to rush you, but let's speed things up a bit.
Asami says: Why? This game is all about slow, methodical strategy.
Bolin says: No, it's not. This is a fast-paced, edge of your seat, game of chance! Don't think. Just go.
Asami says: I don't know what Shady Shin taught you, but it wasn't the real Pai Sho.
Bolin says: Oh really? I think Mr. Rulebook might disagree with you.  The origins of Pai Sho date back over ten thousand years. It is a game of both strategy and chance. Wait, how can it be both?
Asami says: Let me see that.  There have been countless variations of Pai Sho through the centuries and each culture has its own rules and variations of the game.
Bolin says: That's no help at all. Korra, as the Avatar, you need to standardize these Pai Sho rules.
Korra says:  Okay, I'll put that on my to-do list, right after bringing back the Air Nation and taking down the group that tried to kidnap me.
Bolin says: That's cool. Whenever you get to it.
Mako says: Assuming we do find Zaheer, what then?
Korra says: Then I make him talk.
Mako says: He was locked away for thirteen years, Korra, and never broke. I don't think a little bending is going to intimidate this guy.
Korra says: You have a better idea?
Mako says: Yeah, we spy on them. If Aiwei and Zaheer don't know they're being watched, they'll talk freely. Then we'll find out who they are and what they want.
Bolin says: That's just like Pai Sho!  In order to defeat your opponent, you first have to know your opponent.
Asami says: Then I guess I know you pretty well.  I win.
Bolin says: What? Ugh. All right, you know what that was just a fluke. Best two out of three.  Oh, come on! Best four out of seven. Eight out of fifteen. Seventeen out of thirty-three?  Ha, ha! Looks like you're on the ropes this time.
Asami says: I can't believe it. You might actually win this one. 
Bolin says: No, Pabu?  Why? 
Korra says: It's almost sundown. Why hasn't Aiwei left yet?
Asami says: Maybe he sneaked out when you weren't looking.
Mako says: No, I just saw him peeking out of his window fifteen minutes ago. It's in my logbook.
Korra says: I'm going over there. 
Mako says: Korra, wait! You're going to blow our element of surprise. 
Korra says: It's over, Aiwei! Where's ...?  What?
Bolin says: That's a weird way to nap.
Korra says: He's not sleeping. He's meditating. Wait! Asami, those spirits were trying to tell us something earlier. Xai Bau's Grove isn't on the map because it's not in the physical world! It's in the Spirit World! I'm going in after him. 
Mako says: We'll watch him in case he wakes up. Be careful!
Zaheer says: What happened back in Zaofu? You told me we wouldn't have any problems getting the Avatar? Because of you, we've all been compromised.
Aiwei says: No, any evidence was destroyed when my library burned.
Zaheer says: Where is your physical body now?
Aiwei says: At the Misty Palms Inn. But there is no need to worry. I was not followed.
Zaheer says: You left a loose end.
Aiwei says: I assure you, no one knows anything about us.
Zaheer says:  No, you are the loose end. 
Korra says: Zaheer!
Zaheer says: It seems Aiwei was mistaken. He was followed.
Korra says: That's right. We knew he'd lead us straight to you. Now, what did you do with him?
Zaheer says: He'll be spending eternity in the Fog of Lost Souls, which just leaves the two of us. 
Korra says: Don't move, Zaheer. You're going to give me some answers.
Zaheer says:  There's no need for aggression. Neither of us has our bending, and I'm not going anywhere. I'll answer whatever questions you have. You deserve that much.  What would you like to know?
Korra says: First off, who are you people, and why do you keep trying to take me?
Zaheer says: We are part of a secret society, dedicated to restoring freedom to the world. We are the Red Lotus.
Korra says: Red Lotus? Are you related to the White Lotus?
Zaheer says: We are what the White Lotus was meant to be. But after the Hundred Year War, the White Lotus lost its true purpose. Its members came out of hiding and openly served the Avatar. They became nothing but glorified bodyguards who served corrupt nations. So a great man named Xai Bau broke from the White Lotus and began his own society.
Korra says: That's a great story, but it doesn't explain why you tried to take me when I was a kid.
Zaheer says: That was Unalaq's idea.
Korra says: What? My uncle was part of the Red Lotus?
</scene>

<scene>
Zaheer says: Avatar Korra. Misty Palms Inn. Find her.
P-Li says: You two go. I'll stay here and make sure Zaheer's body is safe.
</scene>

<scene>
Zaheer says: I met your uncle when I was a teenager, after we had both joined the Red Lotus. We learned about Raava and Vaatu, and how Avatar Wan foolishly severed them, disrupting the balance of the world forever.
Korra says: Avatar Wan wasn't foolish! He was trying to restore balance.
Zaheer says: He closed the portals, severing humans from spirits. Even you realize the error in his ways.
Korra says: So all along, you and my uncle planned to use me to open the portals and release Vaatu? That's why you tried to take me when I was a kid?
Zaheer says: Yes, and with members of the Red Lotus as your elemental masters, we could've taught you so much.
Korra says: It sounds like you were just trying to brainwash me so I'd do whatever you wanted.
Zaheer says: No, Korra. All I wanted was to show the Avatar a better path for the world.
</scene>

Mako says: Uh, I don't know how, but Water Arm Lady and Lava Guy found us. 
Asami says: How?
Mako says: I just said I don't know how!
Bolin says:  Korra, come on! Wake up!
Asami says: What do we do?
Mako says:  Get Korra out of here. Bolin and I will hold them off.
Ming-Hua says: The Avatar!
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: If my uncle came up with a plan to abduct me when I was a kid, why wasn't he caught?
Zaheer says: He wasn't with us that night, and he covered up his involvement afterwards.
Korra says: So he betrayed you, just like he betrayed me.
Zaheer says: Yes. He allowed me and my friends to remain in prison while he pursued his own selfish goals. Unalaq becoming a Dark Avatar was never part of our mission.
Korra says: And what is your mission, exactly?
Zaheer says: I want what you want: to restore balance to this world.
Korra says: I don't think our ideas of balance are the same.
Zaheer says: Are you sure about that? You kept the spirit portals open. But why stop there? Bringing the spirits back should only be the beginning.
Korra says: What do you mean?
Zaheer says: The idea of having nations and governments is as foolish as keeping the human and spirit realms separate. You've had to deal with a moronic president and a tyrannical queen. Don't you think the world would be better off if leaders like them were eliminated?
Korra says: No. I mean, I don't really agree with what they've done, but taking out world leaders isn't the answer.
Zaheer says: It wasn't too long ago that the airbenders were nearly all wiped out, thanks to the Fire Lord's desire for world dominance. True freedom can only be achieved when oppressive governments are torn down.
Korra says: But that won't bring balance. It will throw the world into chaos.
Zaheer says: Exactly. The natural order is disorder. Do you know who once said, "New growth cannot exist without first the destruction of the old"?
Korra says: No.
Zaheer says: The wise Guru Laghima. An airbender.

Zaheer says: You know, being locked away for so many years, I was beginning to lose hope.  But when I awoke with airbending, I knew I would be the one to destroy the old world and plant seeds for a new world to flourish.
Korra says:  Zaheer, please, as an airbender, you could help make a positive difference in the world, instead of destroying it.
Zaheer says: You're a very smart young woman, Korra. But you must realize that once change begins, it cannot be stopped, even by the Avatar.
Korra says: Enough with your philosophical mumbo-jumbo! I want to know one thing. If you do capture me, what are you going to do with me?
Zaheer says: You'll have that answer soon enough. The Red Lotus should have you by now. See you in the physical world. 
Korra says: Zaheer!  Zaheer, you tricked me! Let me go!  Asami, are you okay? Where's the rest of the Red Lotus?
Asami says: What's the Red Lotus? And Zaheer didn't capture us, the Earth Queen's forces did.
Korra says: Where are we?
Asami says: I'm not sure. Some camp by the desert. They're taking us back to Ba Sing Se.

Battling Northies out there in the snow.  When Unalaq starts trouble, he'll punch him in the mouth.  He's Nuktuk, the hero of the South. 
Varrick says:  Bolin, look up there. What do you see?
Bolin says:  I- is this a trick question?
Varrick says: I'll tell you what I see: a star being born. You're a star. People love stars. Stars tell them what to think and how to act. Bolin, have you ever tried to force a monkey marmot to ride a bicycle?
Bolin says: Uh ... not that I can recall.
Varrick says: Of course you haven't. You can't force monkey marmots to do anything. They've got to want to do it themselves!
Bolin says: Right ...
Varrick says: With these movers, we'll have the support of the people, and before long, they'll persuade the President to lend his troops to the war effort.
Evil Unalaq says:  My evil plan is working. I've captured Nuktuk's beautiful girlfriend.
Nuktuk says:  Not so fast, Evil Unalaq! Oh, I will save my true love and the South!  And now, your time is up.

Asami says:  Without that sale, I don't know how much longer I can keep my company going. What am I gonna do?
Mako says: Don't worry. I'm gonna find whoever's responsible. Chief Beifong is about to question the captain of the ship. 
Lin says: I know it's been a long day, but walk me through what happened.
Captain says: We were ambushed about thirty klicks outside the harbor. We never heard them coming.
Lin says: This is the third attack this week at about the same location.
Lu says: Yep, and smack-dab in Republic City's jurisdiction, which means another problem for us.  All this stress is gonna turn old black beauty gray.
Gang says: It's gotta be Northern Water Tribe. They're trying to stop supply lines to the South.
Lin says: I agree. Is there anything else about the attack you remember? Anything unusual?
Captain says: There is one thing. The bombs exploded in a way I've never seen before. They didn't have fuses.  It was like they were being detonated remotely.
Mako says: Like the bombs at the cultural center. 
Asami says: Wait, where are you going?
Mako says: I gotta grab some evidence. 
Varrick says: Asami, I heard the news. I can't believe they took my fifth favorite ship in the Varrick Industries fleet! Named her after my mom. Rest in piece, Rocky Bottom.
Asami says: Without the money from that shipment, Future Industries is almost broke.
Mako says: Chief, I think there's a link between this attack and the attack at the cultural center.
Lin says:  What do you think you're doing?
Mako says: Solving this case. Did any of the people who attacked you have one of these in their hand? I think it's a remote detonator.
Captain says: It was too dark to see anything.
Lin says:  Mako!
Mako says: Chief, I don't think the people who attacked were Northern Water Tribe.
Gang says: Of course they were Northern Water Tribe. They were waterbending.
Mako says: Was this one of the guys who attacked?
Captain says: No, I don't recognize him.
Gang says: Oh, that's embarrassing.
Lu says:  Nice try, Rookie.
Lin says: Mako, leave.  Now.
Varrick says:  Great work, everybody. Another open and shut case for the dynamic mustachioed duo!
Asami says: Wait, I think Mako might be onto something.
Mako says: Chief, I know it's a long shot, but I have an idea how we can catch these guys.
Lu says:  Yeah, let's all listen to the rookie.
Asami says: He's doing a better job than you!
Varrick says: Whooooo's hungry?

</scene>

Mako says: Lu and Gang are idiots. I hate them and their stupid mustaches.
Asami says: Forget them. What's this idea of yours?
Mako says: A sting operation. I was thinking we'd set up a bait ship, take it out into the open ocean, and capture whoever attacks it.
Asami says: Let's do it.
Mako says: It's not that easy. For the plan to work, we need the police, and Beifong already said no.
Asami says: We can make it work, just the two of us.
Mako says: I don't know. I don't want to go behind Beifong's back. If she finds out, I could get kicked off the force.
Asami says: Mako, I need your help. My Mom is gone. My Dad is in jail. Future Industries is all I have left of my family.
Mako says: I want to help you, but this is more than a two-person job. First of all, we'd need a ship.
Varrick says: You need a ship? I got a ship. I want in on whatever you're talking about. I love being in on plans.
Asami says: The less you know, the better.
Varrick says: Perfect! I love not knowing things.

Mako says:  Is this a marble statue of you?
Bolin says: It's also  a hat rack.
Mako says:  We don't even have hats.
Bolin says: That's because we never had a hat rack. And now we do. Mako, you seem stressed. I think you need to take a little dipity dip. 
Mako says: I don't have time to take a dipity dip, okay? I'm trying to catch whoever's been attacking the shipments, and I need your help.
Bolin says: You need my help?  I don't know. I'm kinda busy.
Mako says: You're sitting in a hot tub.
Bolin says: I'm maintaining my instrument. As an actor, my body is my instrument.
Mako says:  Are you gonna help or not?
Bolin says: You know, I recall a time when I needed your help, and you basically told me to get a life.
Mako says: So that's a no. What am I supposed to do now?

Asami says: Are you sure this is a good idea?
Mako says: No, but it's our last resort. 
Triple Threat doorman says:  Hey, Mako. Whatever you think we did, we didn't do it.
Mako says: I'm not here on police business. I'm running an off-the-books operation, and I thought the Triple Threats might want a piece of the action.
Triple Threat doorman says: How big a piece?
Viper says: So Mr. Law and Order needs our help, huh? What's in it for the Triple Threats?
Mako says: I am personal friends with that Avatar. I might be able to convince her to give Shady Shin his bending back.
Shady Shin says: Sounds good to me, boss. 
Viper says: What about the rest of us?
Asami says: I've got vehicles, all brand-new and top of the line. They can be yours if you help.
Viper says:  I think we got ourselves a deal.

Mako says: This is right around the area where the attacks happened. So keep your eyes peeled, and stay quiet.
Two Toed Ping says: I agree. Keep quiet. Mouth zipped, don't say a word. That's the best thing to do when you're trying to ambush somebody, which is what we're doing here, and it's basically what I'm always doing. I mean, I am a gangster, after all, and -
Mako says: Two Toed Ping, please.
Two Toed Ping says: Oh, right. So, what's it like dating the Avatar.  Come on, Mako, I gotta know.
Mako says: Ping, stay focused!
Two Toed Ping says: What? What are you so weird about it? If I was dating the Avatar, I'd tell you all about it.
Mako says:  There's nothing to know.  I broke up with her.
Asami says:  You broke up? When? Why didn't you tell me?
Mako says: I don't know.
Two Toed Ping says:  Yeah, right. You broke up with the Avatar. Like that happened. Hey, Shady Shin, Viper. Mako says he broke up with the Avatar.
Shady Shin says: Sure he did.
Viper says: Yeah, I did too. 
Mako says: All right, would you guys knock it off and do your job?

Assistant director says: And action!
Ginger says:  Forget about me. You must capture the evil Unalaq before he gets away.
Nuktuk says: No! I'll never leave you.
Varrick says: Cut!  There's no kiss in the script.
Bolin says:  Sorry, I just kinda lost myself in the moment.  It just felts so right.
Ginger says:  Urch.
Varrick says: It did, huh? Your girlfriend's about to die, and instead of untying her, you kiss her. Wait a minute! Maybe that will work. Yes! It's genius! Everybody take five. Except for you, Zhu Li. Grab the tweezers. I've got some neck-hair issues to resolve.
Bolin says: So ... that kiss. I liked it. And it seemed like you liked it too.
Ginger says: Uch. You're confusing Ginger the actress with Ginger the character.
Bolin says: Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I'm totally getting, like, a weird vibe from you right now. It's like, a minute ago, when we were shooting, you were into me, but now you're not.
Ginger says: That's because Ginger loves Nuktuk, not Bolin. 
Bolin says: But Nuktuk is Bolin. I'm a hero.

Two Toed Ping says:  And that's why they call me  Two Toed Ping.
Asami says: Because you have two extra toes.
Two Toed Ping says: That's right. And there was already a Twelve Toed Ping on the south side.
Mako says: Wait, guys. Do you hear that?
Asami says: I didn't hear anything.
Two Toed Ping says: No.
Mako says:  Ah! What's taking so long?
Two Toed Ping says: You just gotta relax, like me. Maybe try taking your shoes off.
Mako says: I'm gonna check it out.
Shady Shin says:  So how long do we have to stay out here?
Viper says:  I told you, it's gonna be a few hours. What, do you have a hot date?
</scene>

<scene>
Shady Shin says: Actually, I do. And I wanna look my best. I gotta shower and shave. I have a whole routine, okay?
Viper says: Well, your date's gonna have to wait.
Shady Shin says: She's not gonna be happy about that.
Viper says: Too bad. We were paid to keep Mako and that dame  distracted for a few hours, so that's what we're gonna do. 
Shady Shin says:  See? This is why I never get dates.
</scene>

Mako says: I just overheard Shady Shin and Viper. We've been double-crossed. We have to get off this ship.
Viper says: Where do you think you're going?
Viper says: Get'm!
Mako says: They're getting closer.
Asami says: Not for long. 
Mako says: Watch out! We're not gonna make it.  One down, one to go.
Asami says: We're stalled.
Asami says: Mako, hang onto something.  What was that all about?
Mako says: Someone paid the Triple Threats to keep us distracted.
Asami says: Distracted? From what? Oh no.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Whoever paid the Triple Threats stole everything.
Asami says:  I'm ruined. My company ... it's over.
Mako says: We should check out your other warehouses. Maybe they didn't have time to hit them all.
Asami says: You don't understand. Everything I had was in here.
Mako says: We have to search the place for evidence. If we can find a lead ...
Asami says: Mako ... it doesn't matter anymore.
Mako says: I can figure this out.
Asami says:  Just stop. It's over. I give up.
Mako says: Well, I'm not giving up on you.
Asami says:  Sorry, I-
Mako says: Uh ... It's-it's okay. Um ... Anyway ... I gotta run. I'm gonna find out who did this. And I know just who to ask.

Two Toed Ping says: Hey, Mako. Uh, you're not mad about last night, are you?
Mako says:  Who hired you to double-cross us?
Two Toed Ping says: I don't know.
Mako says: I think you do know.  And you're gonna tell me, or we're gonna have to change your name to "No Toed Ping".
Two Toed Ping says: Really, I don't know. You have to believe me. We never met the guy who hired us.
Mako says:  You expect me to believe that?
Two Toed Ping says:  After you left the hideout, some mook showed up and said his boss would pay us to keep you distracted. We'd never seen him before, and we ain't seen him since. Come on, Mako, you know how these deals work. Please, I would never lie to you with my lucky toes on the line.
Mako says:  Get out of here.

Mako says: Bolin, have you seen Varrick around? Bolin!  Nuktuk.
Bolin says: Yes? Oh, hello, Mako. Didn't notice you there.
Mako says: Where's Varrick? I need to ask him something.
Bolin says: Hmm. Can't say that I've seen him. But I've been kinda busy, you know, rehearsing for my big scene. There's gonna be some crazy  "pyrotechnics". That's mover speak for explosions.
Assistant director says: We need Nuktuk on set. Running explosion scene.
Bolin says: Or sometimes we just call them explosions. Anyway, wish I could stand around here and chitchat, but you know, I gotta go shoot my big scene.

Assistant director says: Okay, the set is clear. Camera's rolling. And ... action!
Nuktuk says: Ginger, stay down! I'm coming for you.

Pyrotechnics technician says: Neat, huh? It's a Varrick Industries exclusive. Here, check it out.  The explosions use a remote detonator.
Mako says: Varrick.

<scene>
Mako says:  Asami, I think I know who set us up.
Varrick says:  Hello, Mako.
Mako says: What are you doing here?
Asami says:  He just saved my company.  Varrick bought a controlling interest in Future Industries. Isn't that great?
Varrick says: Yep, I like to think I'm always there to stand up for the little guy. Especially if that little guy can help this guy become a bigger guy.
Asami says:  So what were you saying, Mako? You think you know who hired the Triple Threats?
Mako says: Yeah, and I'm real close to proving it.  I'll fill you in later.

Everyone thought she was still recuperating, but six months ago, Korra left home and hasn't been seen since. Even Chief Tonraq was shocked to learn that his daughter's whereabouts are unknown.

Mako says:  Hey, Korra! Sooo, I'm not very good at writing letters. It's 2:15 in the afternoon. Weather is fair. Chance of snow showers later today. But enough joking around.  I hope you're dong well. Me? I'm back on the beat. Beifong has me staking out the Red Monsoon hideout. You won't believe what's going down.

Katara says:  Whenever you're ready.
Korra says:  What's the point? We've been at this for almost six months and I can still barely take a couple of steps without collapsing!
Katara says: I know you're frustrated, but—
Korra says: Of course I'm frustrated! A crazy man poisoned me and now I can't dress myself, or cook for myself, o-or do anything for myself! And this whole time, my friends have been off helping the world while I'm stuck with you and you can't even heal me!
Korra says:  That came out wrong.
Katara says: It's ... all right.  Let your anger and frustration flow like water.
Korra says:  I am trying to understand why this happened to me,  but nothing makes any sense!  I'm tired, Katara. I'm so tired.
Katara says:  Korra, I know you feel alone right now. But you're not the first Avatar who's had to overcome great suffering.  Can you imagine how much pain Aang felt when he learned that his entire culture was taken from him?
Korra says:  That ... must have been so awful.
Katara says:  But he never let it destroy his spirit.  He chose to find meaning in his suffering and eventually ... found peace.
Korra says: And ... what am I going to find if I ... get through this?
Katara says: I don't know.  But won't it be interesting to find out?
Katara says: Close your eyes. Visualize yourself walking over to Naga.  Can you see it?
Korra says:  Yes.
Katara says: Now ...  take that first step.

Korra says:  Attack! I can take it!
Tenzin says:  All right! The sparring match is over!
Korra says:  I thought I was ready.
Tenzin says:  There is no shame in taking the time you need to make a full recovery.  Being the Avatar can wait.
Korra says:  But what about the Earth Kingdom? I hear it's still a mess out there.
Tenzin says: The situation has been stabilizing since Kuvira took charge.
Korra says: But that should be me out there fixing things, not her.
Tenzin says: I know you want to help. But trust me, everyone has this under control. I just think you need to ...
Korra says:  If you say, "be patient", I swear I'm gonna water-smack you in the mouth!
Tenzin says:  Nooo ... I was going to say, you need to ... not worry about the future. Be grateful for where you are now and the progress you've made.

Korra says:  Dear Asami, I'm sorry I haven't written to you sooner, but every time I've tried, I never know what to say.  The past two years have been the hardest of my life. Even though I can get around fine now, I still can't go into the Avatar State. I keep having visions of Zaheer and what happened that day.  Katara thinks a lot of this is in my head, so I've been meditating a lot, but sometimes I worry I'll never fully recover.  Please don't tell Mako and Bolin I wrote to you and not them. I don't want to hurt their feelings, but it's easier to tell you about this stuff.  I don't think they'd understand.

Korra says: I know I'm not a hundred percent yet, but I feel like I've hit a wall. I need to be where the action is,  where my friends are.
Tonraq says:  I'll have the White Lotus prepare a boat and they can take you back to Republic City as soon as you're ready.
Korra says:  No, I want to go alone and have some time to clear my head. It'll be good for me.

Korra says:  Well, uhm, I'm kind of in a hurry.

Vendor says:  You sure she's the Avatar?

Light spirit says: Everyone, come here! It's the Avatar!
Skeptical spirit says:  You sure? I don't sense any Raava energy around her. Besides, she's not dressed like the Avatar. And, doesn't the Avatar have ponytails?
Korra says:  Do you mind? I'm trying to concentrate here. And yes, I am the Avatar. I'm just wearing different clothes and I cut my hair.
Light spirit says:  See? I told you guys it was her!  How come you've been away so long?
Korra says: I was hurt pretty bad a while ago and lost touch with my Avatar Spirit.
Skeptical spirit says: No wonder I couldn't feel Raava's energy.
Korra says: I came to the Tree of Time hoping to reconnect with Raava and turn on the Avatar State again. But it's not working.  The last time I was here, I saw all sorts of visions.  Now I don't see anything.
Light spirit says:  Maybe we can help you get better.
Korra says:  I'm sorry, but for years, people have been saying they can help me get better.  Nothing's worked.  I need to figure this out on my own.

Korra says:  Dear Mom and Dad,  I arrived in Republic City a couple weeks ago and couldn't be happier. It's nice to be back at the temple and it's great to see my friends again.  Don't worry, I'm taking it easy, but hopefully I'll be back in action soon. I miss you both very much. Please, give Naga a big hug for me. Love, Korra.  Raava?  Raava!

Light spirit says: Not a what, a who. 
Korra says:  No, wait!  Come back!
Korra says:  You're just in my mind. You're not real.
Korra says: Help!
Unknown woman says:  Feeling better?
Korra says: Where am I? Wha-what happened?
Unknown woman says: I was hoping you could tell me. I found you passed out in the mud.
Korra says: How'd you know I was out there?
Unknown woman says:  I'm pretty tapped into the goings-on around here. What brings you to the swamp, anyway?
Korra says: A spirit led me here and told me I was supposed to find someone. Is that you?
Unknown woman says: Beats me. But if your Avatar senses called you here, you should probably listen to them.
Korra says:  Wait, you recognize me?
Unknown woman says:  In a manner of speaking. We were good friends in your previous life.

Saikhan says: It was an honor serving under Chief Beifong for so many years  and I wish her a speedy recovery. It is with great humility that I take her place as the new Chief of Police. Republic City is facing a threat like none the world has ever seen but there is one man who's been effective against Amon's revolution, Councilman Tarrlok.  That is why for all matters involving the Equalists, I will report directly to him.  The police department will lend any and all available resources to the councilman and his task force  until we quell this insurgency.
Korra says:  What is that weasel snake Tarrlok up to now?
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says:  Tarrlok, I don't know what you did to get Chief Saikhan in your pocket but I highly doubt it was legal.
Tarrlok says: Oh, Tenzin.  Always the conspiracy theorist. Did you ever consider Saikhan simply recognizes my talents and wants what is best for this city?  Well, Avatar Korra. Long time, no see. Now that your little pro-bending distractions are over, I look forward to your return to my task force.
Korra says: Ha!  Forget it! There's no way I'm rejoining your vanity project.
Tarrlok says: That is unfortunate to hear, but I'm sure you'll come to your senses as you have in the past.
Korra says: Don't hold your breath, bub.  You know, Tenzin's been right about you all along.  You played me,  you played Beifong,  and now you're playing the new Chief too.  Well, I got news for you.  You need me,  but I don't need you. I'm the Avatar.
Tarrlok says:  You're not, in fact, the Avatar.  You are merely a half-baked Avatar in training, which reminds me, how is your airbending going?  Made any significant progress with that?  I didn't think so.  If you will not be part of my task force, then you had best stay out of my way.
Korra says:  I don't understand what's wrong with me. I've memorized nearly all of the practice forms, but I still can't produce a single measly puff of air!  I'm a failure.
Tenzin says:  No you're not. You just need to work through this airbending block.
Korra says:  Amazing advice. I'll get right on that.
Tenzin says:  I wasn't finished yet. You see, Aang not only had his bending teachers, but also his past lives to call upon for guidance. Have you ever made contact with your past lives?
Korra says: No, of course I haven't. Didn't you get the memo from the White Lotus? I'm a spiritual failure, too.
Tenzin says: You may have made a connection without realizing it.  Perhaps something you mistook as a dream?
Korra says: Maybe. I had a few weird hallucinations,  but I hardly even remember them.
Tenzin says:  And did you see any previous Avatars in these visions?
Korra says: I saw Aang. It seemed like he was in trouble. What do you think it means?
Tenzin says: Hmm, I don't know.  But I urge you to meditate on these visions.  I believe Aang's spirit must be trying to tell you something.

Asami says:  No, that's nonsense! You're amazing!
Mako says:  Yeah and remember. Aang hadn't mastered all the elements when he was battling the Fire Nation. He was just a little kid.
Bolin says:  And he wasn't alone. He had his friends to help him. Look, the arena might be shut down but we're still a team. The new Team Avatar!
Mako says: We got your back Korra, and we can save this city.  Together.
Korra says:  Yeah, let's do it!
Meelo says:  Yeah, let's do it!  What are we doing? 
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says:  Get ready, Republic City.  You are about to be patrolled by Team Avatar.
Mako says:  Asami, you always know how to accessorize your outfits.
Asami says: I figure one way to fight Equalists is to use an Equalist weapon. 
Korra says: All right,  Let's ride.
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says:  Naga away!
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: All right, scratch that.  Any other ideas?
Asami says:  Hmm.  I think I have the answer.
Asami says: You think this'll do?
Mako says:  I like the new Team Avatar's style.
Police dispatcher says: Unit two sixteen, cancel that ten fifty-eight at Harmony Tower. Come back to the station, over. 
Asami says: My dad had police scanners installed in all of his cars. I guess now I know why.
Police dispatcher says: Calling all units, Level Four Alert. Jailbreak at headquarters. Officers down, electrocuted. Chi blockers and Equalist convicts are still at large armed and dangerous.  Last seen heading east. I repeat, Level Four Alert. Equalist jailbreak! 
Bolin says:  Chi blockers!
Mako says:  That's them! 
Korra says:  Let's get 'em!
Asami says: Korra! Bolin! Give me a ramp! Now!
Asami says: Help me out! We gotta make this turn!
Asami says: They don't know we made the turn. Okay, get ready.
Tarrlok says:  Avatar Korra, what do you think you are doing?
Korra says:  Oh, hey Tarrlok. Nice of you to show up finally. Here, we captured the escaped convicts for you.
Tarrlok says:  What you did was tear up the city and impede the real authorities in their pursuit of these criminals.
Korra says:  Hmm, that's funny.  I didn't see your little task force or the cops the whole time.  If it wasn't for Team Avatar,  they would've gotten away.
Tarrlok says:  This is your last warning. Stay out of my way! 
</scene>

<scene>
Tarrlok says:  Republic City stands as a beacon of freedom, but the Equalists are using that freedom to tear it down.  The law I have proposed would make it illegal for anyone to be a member of the Equalists or even be associated with them. It also puts into effect a curfew, ensuring all nonbenders are in their own homes by nightfall.
Tenzin says: This is going too far, Tarrlok!  You can't punish all nonbenders for the actions of a few! 
Tarrlok says:  That kind of cowardice will cause our city to fall into Amon's hands. We must pass this law. All in favor? 
Police dispatcher says: All available units, please respond to the fifty six hundred block of Dragon Flats borough. Equalists have taken to the streets, consider them armed and dangerous. Proceed with caution. 
Bolin says: I call front!
Mako says:  After you.
Korra says: What a gentleman,  thanks!
Korra says: Why is the power out?
Asami says:  Wait a second, these people aren't armed or dangerous.
Korra says:  Sure doesn't look that way. 
Saikhan says: All nonbenders, return to your homes immediately.
Male #1 says: Yeah, as soon as you turn our power back on. 
Saikhan says: Disperse, or you will all be arrested.
Female #1 says:  You benders can't treat us this way! 
Child #1 says: Mummy, look! It's the Avatar! 
Female #1 says:  Please, help us! You're our Avatar, too!
Korra says:  Everyone, please stay calm. I'm gonna put a stop to this.  Tarrlok, you need to turn the power back on and leave these people alone.
Tarrlok says:  Avatar Korra, you and your playmates have no business here.
Korra says: We're not going anywhere. You don't have the right to treat these innocent people like criminals.
Tarrlok says:  This is an Equalist rally.  There is nothing innocent about it.
Asami says:  They're not Equalists, they're just normal people who want their rights back.
Tarrlok says:  They are the enemy!  Round up all these Equalists!
Korra says:  Stop!
Asami says:  Hey! Let me go!
Tarrlok says:  You're under arrest!
Mako says:  What?  You can't do that!
Tarrlok says:  Actually, I can. She's a nonbender out past curfew  and her father is a known Equalist conspirator.
Mako says:  Let her go!
Tarrlok says:  Arrest him and his brother! 
Korra says:  Tarrlok! 
Tarrlok says: Unless you want to join your friends in prison, I suggest you put those down and go back to the Air Temple.
Mako says: Korra, listen to him. It's not worth it. 
Bolin says:  We'll be all right.
Korra says:  Don't worry, I'll call Tenzin. He can get you out. 
Tarrlok says: So sad to see your little Team Avatar broken up. You had a good run.
Korra says:  This isn't over, Tarrlok.
Tarrlok says: Oh, I believe it is.  Take them away. 
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  Hey! 
Tenzin says: I came as fast as I could. Are your friends all right?
Korra says:  I don't know! These knuckleheads won't tell me anything.
Tenzin says:  I'll take care of this.  Saikhan, a word please.
Saikhan says:  Councilman Tenzin, I'm pretty swamped at the moment. Can this wait?
Tenzin says: No, it cannot. Three of Avatar Korra's friends were wrongly arrested tonight. I'd like you to release them immediately.
Saikhan says: They're not going anywhere. They were interfering with police business.
Korra says: Your so called police business was rounding up innocent people and claiming they were Equalists. They should be released, too.
Saikhan says: All Equalists suspects are being detained indefinitely. They'll be freed if and when the task force deems they are no longer a threat.
Tenzin says: Those people are entitled to due process under the law.
Saikhan says: You'll have to take that up with Councilman Tarrlok.
Tenzin says:  Oh, I plan to. At the council meeting, first thing in the morning. 
Korra says:  You're officially the worst Chief of Police ever! 
Tenzin says:  Calm down, Korra.  I'll get this sorted out, we just need to be patient.  But you really are the worst!  Ever!

Korra says:  You and I need to talk. 
Tarrlok says:  Are any of the other council members here?
Council page says: I believe everyone has gone home for the night.
Tarrlok says: Then you should do the same.
Council page says:  Are you sure, sir?
Tarrlok says: Leave us.  You obviously have something on your mind? Spit it out.
Korra says: Don't you see? You're doing exactly what Amon says is wrong with benders. You're using your power to oppress and intimidate people!
Tarrlok says:  And you don't?
Korra says:  Of-  Of course not!
Tarrlok says: Isn't that what you came here to do? Intimidate me into releasing your friends.  See, that's what I admire about you, Korra. Your willingness to go to extremes in order to get what you want. It is a quality we both share.
Korra says:  You and I are nothing alike!
Tarrlok says: Look, I'll make you a deal. You fall in line and do what I say and I'll release your friends.
Korra says:  That's why you arrested them? To get to me?
Tarrlok says:  I need your answer.
Korra says:  No. You might be able to manipulate Chief Saikhan into following you, but it won't work on me.
Tarrlok says:  You will regret that decision.
Korra says: You need to be stopped!  You're just as bad as Amon!
Tarrlok says:  I've tried to work with you, Korra, but you've made it impossible.
Korra says:  Still think that I'm a half-baked Avatar?
Korra says: What are you gonna do now? You're all out of water, pal.
Tarrlok says: You're in my way Avatar, and you need to be removed.
Korra says:  You're, you're a bloodbender?
Tarrlok says: Very observant.
Korra says:  It's not a full moon!  How- how are you doing this?!
Tarrlok says: There are a lot of things you don't know about me.
Korra says: Where are you taking me?
Tarrlok says: Somewhere no one will find you.  Say goodbye to Republic City, Avatar Korra. You'll never see it again! 
Korra says:  You can't do this!  Let me out!  Garh!

Unbeknownst to the kids, Korra found refuge in the swamp with Toph, who discovered there was still metal poison in her body, but when Toph tried removing it, Korra resisted. Will the airbender kids find the Avatar and help her return to action?

Tenzin says: Raiko asked me to stay here and help figure out a diplomatic solution to this Kuvira problem.
Ikki says: Mom, we'll be fine. Grandpa Aang and his friends were around our age when they traveled the world.
Pema says:  Well, at least I don't have to worry about you starving out there.
Meelo says: Mom, we're going to be out in the wild, living off the land! We don't need your food! 
Pema says: But I made your favorite treat ...
Meelo says:  Sweet buns with happy faces on them?  Well, I guess we're not officially on the road yet.  Aww, this one is smudged.  I can't eat this.
Pema says: You know, sometimes things get smudged in the wild.
Tenzin says: We're you able to get a read on Korra yet?
Jinora says: No, but once we're further out, I'll be able to hone in on her spiritual energy. We should be able to find her within a few days.
Tenzin says:  Good luck! And be careful! Remember, Jinora's in charge!
Meelo says: I answer to no man. Or girl, even if she does have tattoos.
Tenzin says:  Meelo ...

Jinora says: Why don't you go play with some of those spirits?
Ikki says:  Jinora's spirity powers are broken, and she doesn't know where Korra is.
Jinora says: My powers are not broken. I just need more than two seconds and some quiet.

Meelo says: While you try to pull yourself together, Poki and I are gonna go into town and find out if anyone has seen Korra.
Ikki says:  Sounds like a good plan to me!
Meelo says:  Enough chit-chat, you can hold the picture of Korra I drew. 
Ikki says:  Wow, I didn't know you could draw!
Meelo says:  You don't know a lot of things about me, sister.  Let's roll!
Meelo says: Have you seen this woman? 
Old lady says: Well, aren't you an adorable little thing.
Meelo says:  I'm not adorable! I'm dangerous.
Old lady says:  Dangerously cute with those cheeks. 
Ikki says:  Aww.
Meelo says:  This. Never. Happened. Let's split.
Man #1 says: The Avatar? We still have one of those? Haven't seen her, kid. Sorry. 
Ikki says: Man ...
Meelo says: Can I trust you?
Tuyen says: I guess so.
Meelo says: I'm on a top secret mission to find the Avatar.  Have you seen her?
Tuyen says: I haven't, sorry. Top secret mission, huh?
Meelo says:  Yeah, it's been pretty dangerous. I've seen some things.
Tuyen says: Really? What kind of things?
Meelo says: Craaazy things.
Tuyen says: Cool.
Meelo says: I'm Meelo. What should I call you, other than "beautiful"?
Tuyen says: I'm Tuyen. Nice to meet you.
Ikki says:  Ooh!  Meelo's got a girlfriend!
Meelo says:  Go away, Ikki!
Ikki says:  Jinora's been looking for you. We're moving on.
Tuyen says: Looks like you got to get back to your mission.  Good luck. 
Meelo says:  Thanks a lot, Ikki. You drove away the love of my life. 
Meelo says: Jinora! Ikki! It's Korra!
Ikki says:  Where?! Where?! Where?!
Jinora says:  It's just a photo of Korra.
Meelo says: At least it's something.
Fishmonger says: Pretty neat, huh? She came by here, about uh, six months ago.
Meelo says:  Looks like someone just strummed up a good-old-fashioned lead.  Then where did she go?
Fish monger says: Oh, I don't know. But she wasn't looking too good.
Meelo says:  Ikki, this is all your fault.
Ikki says: What? I didn't do anything.
Meelo says: Exactly!  You need to start pulling your weight!  That goes for you too, so-called leader! 
Ikki says: Remember when he used to be so nice and sweet?
Jinora says: No.
Korra says: So ... what's the plan for today?
Toph says: You're looking at it.
Korra says: We didn't do anything yesterday, or the day before that.  I know! Tell me the story of how you taught Aang how to earthbend.
Toph says: What's there to tell? I threw some rocks at the Avatar, he got all whiny and Sokka fell in a hole.
Korra says:  I thought there'd be more to it than that.  What about the time you took down the Fire Lord? That must have been epic!
Toph says: Oh yeah. It was hot. I was on a blimp. And I think a giant turtle showed up. Wow. What a day.
Korra says:  Okay, you're terrible at telling stories.
Toph says: You're terrible at listening to them!
Toph says: Quit making all that racket! If you're so anxious to do something, why don't you collect some mushrooms for dinner?
Korra says:  You got it.
Toph says: Take the path until you see the boulder with the hole in it. Then go to your left. Oh, and make sure you get the big, slimy ones!  They're the tastiest!
Ikki says:  Hey, where's all the food Mom gave us?
Meelo says: I threw it in the river.
Ikki says: You did what?! That food was supposed to last us two weeks!
Jinora says:  Hey, keep it down! I'm trying to meditate.
Meelo says: Yeah, keep it down, Ikki.
Ikki says:  Meelo threw away all our food!
Meelo says: From now on, we hunt for our meals.
Ikki says: Meelo, we're vegetarians. We don't hunt!
Meelo says: Enough whining. Poki and I will go find some grub.
Ikki says:  My name is Meelo. I like to throw away food and fart at inappropriate moments.  I'm Jinora. I'm above it all because I'm meditating all the time.  Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see you there.
Ikki says: Wait! You dropped your breakfast!
Ikki says: Hey!  Does this mean we're friends?
Outpost soldier #1 says: You're trespassing! Hold it right there.
Outpost soldier #1 says: All right, little airbender. Tell us what you're doing in the Earth Empire. Are you spying?
Ikki says: No! I swear I'm not a spy. I've been traveling with my brother and sister. It's our first big mission and my dad, Tenzin, is counting on us. But if we don't find the Avatar, he's gonna be really disappointed.
Outpost soldier #1 says:  Can I talk to you for a second?  This girl is Tenzin's kid and she's looking for the Avatar.  Do you know what that means?
Outpost soldier #2 says: No, but try this macaroon! 
Outpost soldier #1 says:  Get that out of my face! Look, if we capture these three airbender kids and bring them to Kuvira,  I bet we get a big-time promotion.
Outpost soldier #2 says: You mean we get out of this dump? 
Outpost soldier #1 says:  Sorry, little lady, it looks like we got off on the wrong foot. So, you're out here with your brother and sister, where's your campsite?
Ikki says: Why do you want to know?
Outpost soldier #2 says: We just want to get the family back together again. Maybe we can sit everybody down and have a nice plate of macaroons. 
Ikki says:  Where did you get those?
Outpost soldier #2 says: I found a whole sack of food down by the river! And with each delicious snack, comes a lovely hand-written note.  This one says: "You're my handsome little man." That is so touching!
Ikki says: My mom wrote those notes! That's our sack of food!
Outpost soldier #1 says:  Enough with the cute notes! Where are your brother and sister?
Ikki says: Who cares ... I don't want to see them. I'd rather hang out here with you guys. Hit me with one of those macaroons.

Meelo says:  Yep, totally fine!  I hope you're hungry, because we found some ...  We found some berries!

Jinora says:  Looks like you got some bad berries.  So much for living off the land.
Meelo says: They're fine, I just ate too many of them because they're so ... so delicious.
Jinora says: Did you run into Ikki while you were picking your poisonous berries?
Meelo says: No, what? Did she run off or something?
Jinora says: I think so.
Meelo says: Great. Now I've got to go find the Avatar and her. This mission is getting worse by the day.
Jinora says:  This isn't only your mission, Meelo. I thought we were doing this as a family.

Ikki says: It seems pretty lonely out here. Where's everybody else?
Outpost soldier #1 says: I ... don't want to talk about it.
Outpost soldier #2 says: He's just upset because Kuvira's taking all the troops to Zaofu and we had to stay here.
Outpost soldier #1 says:  Well it's the last city left and then the whole empire will be united! And you know there's gonna be a huge party afterwards.
Ikki says: It's tough to be left out, huh? I know exactly what you're going through.
Outpost soldier #1 says:  You do?
Ikki says: Yeah. My brother and sister are always leaving me out of fun stuff. I mean, we're supposed to be looking for the Avatar together, but they won't even let me help.
Outpost soldier #2 says: Well, that's not fair. Maybe we can help you out!  So, where have you looked for her?
Ikki says:  We've been traveling down the west coast, and the only lead we have is some guy who said he saw her six months ago.
Outpost soldier #1 says: Well, we have troops ... pretty much everywhere. If anyone saw her, they would have reported it.
Ikki says:  What about this place?
Outpost soldier #1 says: Well, that's the swamp. No one goes there.
Outpost soldier #2 says: Don't get discouraged, Ikki. You're a valuable member of the team, and you have a big heart! I know you're going to find her. Now let's get you out of those ropes.
Meelo says: You're welcome, Ikki.
Ikki says:  Why did you do that?
Jinora says:  We're saving you. Let's go.
Ikki says: I had everything under control. I just found our food, and I have an idea where Korra is.
Jinora says: You do? Then lets get going!
Ikki says: Hold on.  Sorry my brother and sister knocked you out. Nice chatting with you!
Outpost soldier #2 says:  Ugh ... Macaroon ...

Toph says:  There you are. You got my dinner yet?
Korra says: No ... this swamp ... it did crazy things to my mind. I had visions, of all the times my enemies hurt me.
Toph says:  Yeah, I figured something like that might happen.
Korra says:  What? You wanted me to see those visions? You are one twisted old lady, you know that?
Toph says: Look, I know you want to get better. And so does the swamp! It can sense you're out of balance. It will teach you what you need to learn, if you're open to listening.
Korra says:  Okay, swamp. I'm all ears.
Toph says: You said you saw your past enemies. Now, why do you think that is?
Korra says: I don't know. Because they made me and a lot of other people suffer.
Toph says: Sounds like you're carrying around your former enemies, the same way you're still carrying around that metal poison. You maybe consider you could learn something from them?
Korra says:  Sounds like the swamp is messing with your mind too.
Toph says: My mind is just fine, thank you. Listen,  what did Amon want? Equality for all. Unalaq? He brought back the spirits. And Zaheer believed in freedom.
Korra says: I guess ...
Toph says: The problem was, those guys were totally out of balance and they took their ideologies too far.
Korra says: Okay, fine. But that doesn't explain why they keep haunting me.
Toph says: Because you need to face your fears. You can't expect to deal with future enemies if you're still fighting the old ones.
Korra says: Maybe you're right, but how am I supposed to move on?
Toph says: Boy, you Avatars sure need a lot of hand-holding. Get up! We're going to the banyan-grove tree.
</scene>

Ikki says: Those soldiers said there weren't any troops here and, I figure, if Korra's not feeling good, she might come to a spiritual place like this to get better.
Jinora says: There is an enormous amount of spiritual activity here, but I don't feel Korra.
Meelo says: Well, that's what we get for listening to Ikki.
Ikki says: Guys! We just got here. Let's at least look around.
Jinora says: I'm sorry, Ikki, but I'm with Meelo on this. I don't think we're going to find her here. Let's go Pepper!
Meelo says: Why did those stupid vines pull us in here anyway?
Ikki says: Because they want us here. I'm telling you, Korra has got to be close.
Jinora says: I don't know, Ikki, I still don't sense Korra.
Ikki says:  Well, you haven't sensed her the entire time we've been looking for her!
Meelo says: Next time I go on a mission, it's going to be boys only. Just Poki and me.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: It's beautiful.
Toph says: The roots of the banyan-grove tree spread out for miles in every direction, connecting this whole swamp. Your problem is, you've been disconnected for too long. Disconnected from the people who love you and disconnected from yourself.
Meelo says:  I'm tired of listening to you!

Meelo and Ikki says:  Yeah!

Ikki says: We missed you so much, Korra.
Korra says: I missed you so much, too. How did you find me all the way out here?
Ikki says: Jinora sensed your energy.
Jinora says: But we never would have been here if it weren't for Ikki.
Ikki says: I never would have stormed off and run into those soldiers if it weren't for Meelo.
Meelo says: I was trying to toughen up these ladies, but I guess it was a team effort.
Ikki says: I love your hair.
Meelo says: It's so you.
Korra says: I'm so sorry. This is Meelo, Jinora, and Ikki. Aang and Katara's grandchildren.
Toph says: Your grandpa was a real pain in my butt.
Meelo says: Wait a minute. Cranky? Old? Blind? You must be Toph!
Toph says:  Oh, I like this one.
Jinora says:  You need to come home, Korra. Kuvira is taking over the Earth Kingdom.
Ikki says: You have to stop her.
Korra says: I don't know ... I'm not the Avatar I used to be. I can't even go into the Avatar State.
Ikki says: Please, Korra.
Jinora says: The world needs you back.
Korra says: All right. I'm ready.
Toph says: I'm not bending it out of you. You've got to do this on your own.
Toph says: Close your eyes. Clear your mind. And don't freak out, like last time! Now, focus your energy. Find the metal. Let it move through you body.
Toph says: That fight is over. Release the fear.
Toph says: Well done, Korra.
Meelo says:  The Avatar is back in business!
Korra says:  I feel so much lighter. Thank you so much for helping me. I'd like to give you a hug now, if that's okay with you.

Bolin says:  Does Toph live here? Are we going to get to meet her?
Aiwei says: I'm afraid not.  She would visit from time to time, but years ago she left to wander the world, in search of enlightenment.  No one has seen her since. 
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Wow. Is this where the airbender lives?
Aiwei says: Yes. But first, her mother wants to meet you.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Is this some kind of combat training?
Aiwei says: Not exactly, they are rehearsing for a dance premiere next month.
Suyin says:  That's it for today everyone. 
Aiwei says: Allow me to introduce the matriarch of the Metal Clan, Suyin.
Suyin says: Please call me Su.  Great to finally meet you, Avatar Korra.  And this must be Mako, Bolin, and Asami.
Mako says: You've done your research.
Suyin says: I make it my business to know who's visiting my city.
Korra says: So, you're a dancer.
Suyin says:  Dancer. Leader. Wife. Mother. Collector of rare meteorites. You'll find people here have many skills and interests.  Korra, why did you lie when Aiwei asked if there was anyone else with you? 
Korra says:  What? I, uh, I didn't. I mean ...
Bolin says: Oh ...
Korra says: How did you know I was lying?
Aiwei says: I'm a truth seer. When people lie, their heart rate and breathing increase.  I can sense the most subtle of changes.
Suyin says: Thanks to Aiwei, there are no secrets in our city.
Korra says:  We came with Republic City's Chief of Police. She didn't want anyone to know she was here. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
Suyin says:  Lin's here? Well, I would love to say hello.
Korra says: Wait, you two know each other?
Suyin says: You're joking, right?  Lin never told you about me.
Korra says: No. Why would she?
Suyin says: I'm Lin's sister.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  I found out  why you're so against coming here.  Why didn't you ever tell me you had a sister?
Lin says: Half-sister.
Suyin says: Same mom, different dads, so what?  We're blood, Lin, and after thirty years, the least you could do is say "hello".
Lin says:  I have nothing to say to you.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  You two haven't spoken in thirty years? How come? 
Suyin says: Ask her, I've tried.
Lin says: Oh, don't put that on me.  You're the one who tore our family apart.
Suyin says:  And you've done a bang up job keeping it that way.
Lin says: You haven't changed one bit, have you?
Suyin says: Look, we can stay here arguing about the past all day, but that's not reason the Avatar came here.  My daughter is thrilled to meet you.
Korra says: Lin, your niece is the new airbender! Isn't that amazing?
Lin says:  Yeah. Terrific.
</scene>

<scene>
Suyin says: Those are my two youngest, Wei and Wing. They're playing a game called Power Disc. They invented it all on their own.
Suyin says: Oh, nice power, Wei.
Wei says:  Ha! Wing goes down!
Suyin says: I'm so proud of those two.  Huan, I'd like you to meet the Avatar and her friends. And your Aunt Lin.
Korra says: Nice to meet you.
Huan says:  Hey. 
Bolin says: Wow, that's a really nice ... banana? Yes, very, very lifelike.
Huan says:  It's not a banana! It was inspired by Harmonic Convergence; represents the dawning of a New Age.  Obviously.
Bolin says: Oh, yeah, no, uh, I can, I can totally see that.  I can, oh, let me stand here. Yes, I can see that now. Yes. Thank you.  Banana.  I mean, that's a banana right?
</scene>

<scene>
Suyin says: And this is my daughter, Opal.
Opal says:  Wow, Avatar Korra.  I can't believe you're here. You are so amazing.
Korra says: It's great to meet you, Opal.
Bolin says: Opal. That's a beautiful name.
Opal says:  Thanks.
Bolin says: I'm Bolin. 
Opal says: Opal.  But, uh, you already knew that.
Lin says: Great. We've found the airbender. Let's take her back to the airship and get out of here.
Suyin says: And the woman apparently trying to abduct you is your aunt Lin.
Opal says: Really? I've always wanted to meet you. My mom has told so many stories about you.
Lin says:  I'm sure she has. 
Suyin says: So I've set all of you up in the guesthouses while Korra trains Opal.
Korra says: Oh, I'm sorry. But I was hoping she could train with the rest of the airbenders at the Northern Temple.
Opal says: That sounds amazing.
Suyin says: Nonsense. This is where Opal's home and family are. You can train her here.
Korra says: I guess I could help her get started.
Lin says: Absolutely not! We're leaving.
Korra says: She's just a little worried because there's a bunch of crazy criminals after me.
Suyin says: If you're concerned about security, don't be. This is the safest city in the world.  Now I'll see you all at dinner. And come hungry. My chef will blow the taste buds right out of your mouth.
Korra says: Why do you have such a problem with your sister? She seems nice.  Come on, we can stay a little while. 
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Okay. Let's see what you've got.
Opal says:  I'm not very good.
Korra says: That's okay. I've never been a teacher before, so we're in the same boat.  You'd want to keep your elbows in, torso straight, feet just skimming the ground. Why don't you try it with me?
Korra says: Woah. You're a natural.
Opal says: You really think so? Thanks.

Zaheer says: A student is only  as good as his master.
Kya says: Great news! I just got a message from Tenzin. He's with a whole group of other airbenders at the Northern Temple and he wants all of you to join them.  We leave first thing in the morning.
Zaheer says: And the Avatar is with him?
Kya says:  No. Apparently she had to split off from Tenzin.
Zaheer says:  That's unfortunate. I was really looking forward to meeting her.

Chef says: Tonight, for your dining pleasure, I present a seared wild Kyoshi elephant koi, paired with a ginger-infused pea tendril and hibiscus root salad.
Suyin says: Stunning.
Baatar says:  Sorry, dear, I'm going to have to take dinner to my office. I just had a major breakthrough on the tram station remodel.
Suyin says: Well, don't let me stand away an inspiration.
Baatar says: You're the best!
Suyin says:  That was my brilliant architect of a husband, Baatar, and our oldest son. He engineers all my husband's projects.
Lin says: Five kids. What a nightmare.
Suyin says: No, no. My children are a blessing.
Lin says: Yeah, mom used to say that too, but she never meant it.
Bolin says: Mmmm. I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical when he said "pea tendrils",  but this is delicious.
Opal says:  I know, right. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal in my life.
Bolin says: Oh. I had plenty when Mako and I were living in the streets.  I mean, you'd be surprised how bad food from a dumpster can be.
Opal says: I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Bolin says: No, no, it's okay, that's all in the past. Things are great now. I got to be a pro-bender, fought against a dangerous revolution, became a mover star, and now, I'm helping the Avatar rebuild a whole nation.
Opal says:  Wow. Your life sounds so exciting.
Suyin says: How's your search for the new airbenders going?
Korra says: Honestly, not great. We had to rescue a whole group of them from the Earth Queen.
Suyin says: Oh, she's horrible. She thinks she can just do whatever she wants.
Lin says: Sounds familiar.
Suyin says: What?
Lin says: Nothing.
Suyin says: I mean, the idea of even having a queen is so outdated. Don't you agree, Korra?
Korra says: I ... I haven't really thought about it too much.
Suyin says: Well, you should start. The world is evolving and the Earth Queen can evolve with it or step aside.
Lin says:  Hey, everyone. My little sister is an expert on world affairs now.
Suyin says: You want to talk about what's really bugging you? Because I'm right here!

Varrick says: Sorry we're late, everyone.
Bolin says:  Varrick!
Asami says: What are you doing here?
Varrick says: Great question, Asami. I mean, what are any of us doing here? Wow, food for thought. Any who, how's our company doing?
Asami says: You mean my company. Future Industries reverted back to me after you plotted to abduct the President.
Varrick says: Allegedly plotted to abduct the President. Never convicted.
Mako says: Uh, that's because you escaped prison.
Varrick says: No, the universe decided to set me free. So, I looked up my old friend Suyin here, pitched her a few ideas,  and bam! We're in business together.
Suyin says: Varrick's heading up my new technology division.
Varrick says:  I've seen the future, and the future is, magnets! I'm working on a high speed rail that would revolutionize transportation and shipping as we know it. But that's not all, I'm-
Lin says:  All right, enough!  I'm trying to keep the Avatar safe and you're harboring a criminal?
Suyin says: Ease out, Lin. Sure Varrick's made a few mistakes in his past, but that doesn't mean he should pay for it for the rest of his life. My chef was a pirate, but now he's a culinary master. People change.
Lin says:  You haven't. 
Korra says: Lin!
</scene>

Mako says: So, you and Opal seemed to hit it off dinner. I think she's really into you.
Bolin says: Yeah, I know. She's sweet and pretty and super nice. Too bad she's not my type.
Mako says: Right, I forgot. Your type is dumb mover star or psycho ice princess.
Bolin says:  You know, that really hurts a little bit. Right ...  here.  Maybe you're right, bro. Maybe Opal is Bolin material. Thanks.  Yeah!
</scene>

<scene>
Suyin says: You know, before I built this city, there was nothing here. I wanted to make my mark on the world.
Korra says: It's amazing. Thank you for being so welcoming. And I'm sorry for how Lin's been acting. Can I ask what happened with you two?
Suyin says: It's complicated. We didn't have a normal childhood. Neither of us knew our fathers and Toph was always busy being Chief of Police. Because mom grew up in such a strict household, she gave us all the freedom in the world, hoping we'd figure out our own paths.
Korra says: That sounds like a good thing.
Suyin says: And in a way it was. But we both ended up fighting for mom's attention. Lin followed in her footsteps and became a cop. I was ... more of a rebel. Mom wasn't too happy with how either of us turned out. When I was sixteen, I left home to explore the world.  I sailed the seas on a pirate ship, joined a traveling circus for a while, and lived in a sandbender commune in a desert. It took me a while, but, I finally realized what I was looking for was a family. So I bought this plot of land, found a brilliant architect who later became my husband, and created a place I could truly call home.
Korra says: It sounds like you've created the perfect life here.
Suyin says:  Almost. I've always wanted Lin to be a part of it, but I gave up hope long ago of her ever coming around.

Opal says: Why are you acting weird?
Bolin says: Why are you acting weird?
Opal says: I don't like how you're talking to me. 
Bolin says:  Look, I'm sorry. I just get really self-conscious when I know when a girl likes me, and I-I end up looking stupid.
Opal says: Who said I liked you?
Bolin says: Oh no. But I though ... Mako said-
Opal says: Just kidding. But, do me a favor and stop trying.  Look, don't stop trying. Just stop trying so much. Just be yourself.
Bolin says: Huh. Be myself. Yeah, I guess I can give that a shot.
Opal says: Oh, hey Korra.
Korra says: Can I steal you away from Bolin for a minute? I need you help with something.

Ikki says: What were you reading?
Zaheer says: A poem by Guru Laghima, the wisest airbender who ever lived.
Kya says:  Ikki, you should be in bed. C'mon.
Ikki says: Night.
Zaheer says: Good night.
Kya says:  You seem to know a lot about airbender history for someone who just got airbending.
Zaheer says: I've always admired the culture.
Kya says: And you moved through those gates like a natural. Where did you say you were from?
Zaheer says: A small village up north. You've probably never heard of it.
Kya says: Wait.  Zaheer!
Kya says: I need some help!
White Lotus sentry says: Hold it right there!
Zaheer says: Sorry, I won't be joining you at the Northern Air Temple. I'm afraid I have other plans.

Lin says:  Who is it?
Korra says: Hey, it's me. I brought someone who wants to talk to you. 
Lin says: You want to talk? Then talk.
Opal says: I'm sorry being here has been so hard for you. When you showed up, I was so excited to get to know you. I heard so many great things about you from mom and Grandma Toph. So, I guess I was kind of sad you didn't want to know me.  Believe me, I know my family can be a little crazy and overwhelming some times. But I would love it so much if you would be a part of it.
Lin says: Get out.
Opal says:  Sorry, did I say something wrong?
Lin says:  Get out!
Korra says: What's your problem? Don't get mad at Opal. I asked her to talk to you because I thought it would help you snap out of whatever funk you're in. But I guess I was wrong.
Lin says: Why don't you focus on fixing the world, and stop trying to fix my family?
Korra says: Su's right. You're never going to change. You're always gonna be a bitter, lonely woman.

Bolin says:  Let's back it up, okay?  I said that will make the vines explode.
Mako says: Exactly. This is our only way of shutting this thing down.  I can handle it.
Bolin says:  No! You can't! This isn't the time to prove how awesome you are. I already know how awesome you are  ... you're awesome.

Kuvira says: What happened? Are we ... dead?
Korra says:  No, we're okay, but we're in the Spirit World.  All the energy from your weapon tore open a new portal and blasted us in here.
Kuvira says:  Why would you save my life, after everything I did to you?
Korra says:  I guess ... I see a lot of myself in you.
Kuvira says:  We are nothing alike!
Korra says:  Yes, we are. We're both fierce and determined to succeed,  sometimes without thinking things through.
Kuvira says: This wasn't how I wanted things to end.  If you would have all just surrendered,  none of this would have happened.
Korra says:  You brought this on yourself. Messing with the spirit vines, acting like a dictator over your people ... you had to know what you were doing wasn't right.
Kuvira says:  I was trying to help my people. Su turned her back on the Earth Kingdom, you were gone! I had to do something.
Korra says:  I think I get it now.
Kuvira says:  You don't understand anything about me.
Korra says: I do.  Su told me how she took you in when you were younger.  It must have been so hard being an orphan.
Kuvira says:  Don't pretend you know what it felt like!  The Avatar is adored by millions! I was cast aside by my own parents like I meant nothing to them.  How could I just stand by  and watch the same thing happen to my nation, when it needed someone to guide it?
Korra says:  You wanted to create a place where you and your people would never be vulnerable again.  I may not have been an orphan, but believe me, I understand what it feels like to be afraid.  After I was poisoned, I would have done anything to feel in control.

Varrick says:  Hey, pal, camera on me! This is my big day! 
Bolin says: True love is a fickle creature.  Difficult to find, nearly impossible to tame.  But Varrick and Zhu Li have proven that even the longest of long shots  can have a chance at happiness together. Now, for the vows!  Thank you, Master Pabu. Do you, Sir Iknik Blackstone Varrick of the Southern Water Tribe, Master of the High Seas, take the Lady Zhu Li Moon to be your lawfully wedded wife? Will you promise to treat her not as your assistant, but as your honored and cherished partner?
Varrick says: You're darn tootin' I do!
Bolin says: And do you, Zhu Li, take Varrick, to be your lawfully wedded husband? Do you promise to care for him, in sickness and in health,  and also scrub his callouses on a bi-weekly basis, which ... isn't really that much to ask ...  Okay, I'm not reading all this.
Zhu Li says:  I do take Varrick. Callouses and all.

Wu says:  That's okay, Mako. Sometimes, a good evacuation is its own reward. 
Korra says: Good to see you, Prince Wu. Or should I say, King Wu? You ready to get back to Ba Sing Se and finally take the throne?
Wu says: Yeah  ... about that  ... I was actually thinking of stepping down as king and getting rid of the monarchy all together. 
Mako says:  Are ... you joking?
Wu says: For once,  I'm not. Now I know what you're gonna say, I'm being lazy, I'm afraid of responsibility, I'm putting my singing career before my people, but it's none of those things. I really think the Earth Kingdom would be better off if the states were independent and had elected leaders, like the United Republic.
Mako says:  That's ... actually pretty wise and mature of you.
Korra says: I think it's a great idea. The Earth Kingdom should evolve, and I'll do everything in my power to help you make that happen.
Wu says:  Looking forward to working with you. But for now, the dance floor calls. 
Korra says:  How's the arm?
Mako says: Much better.
Korra says:  The words "thank you" don't feel big enough for what you did. But I honestly don't know what else to say.
Mako says:  You don't need to say anything. I want you to know, I'll follow you into battle, no matter how crazy things get. I've got your back  ... and I always will .

Korra says:  I bet Aang never could have imagined there'd be a spirit portal right in the heart of Republic City.
Tenzin says:  Korra, you've transformed the world more in a few years than most Avatars did during their lifetimes.
Korra says:  But I feel like I've only just begun.  There's so much more I want to learn and do.
Tenzin says:  You don't know how happy I am to hear you so full of hope again.
Korra says:  It's been a bit of a bumpy ride, huh?
Tenzin says: I've come to realize life is one, big, bumpy ride.
Korra says:  I know I was in a pretty dark place after I was poisoned. But I finally understand why I had to go through all that. I needed to understand what true suffering was so I could be more compassionate to others, even to people like Kuvira.
Asami says:  Excuse me Tenzin, Varrick is looking for you. Something about wanting to borrow a glidersuit to fly off the tower?
Tenzin says:  That doesn't seem like a good idea!
Korra says:  Wanna sit with me for a minute? I'm not ready to get back to the party just yet.  I don't think I ever really apologized.
Asami says:  For what?
Korra says: For being gone all that time. For not coming back sooner. 
Asami says:  You don't need to apologize for anything.  I'm just so happy you're here now.  I don't think I could have handled losing you and my father in the same day. 
Korra says: I am so sorry for what happened. 
Asami says:  Thank you. I'm just glad I was able to forgive him. 
Korra says:  So, what now? Back to the dance floor?
Asami says: I'm kind of all danced out. Honestly, after everything that's happened the past few months, I could use a vacation.
Korra says:  Let's do it! Let's go on a vacation, just the two of us. Anywhere you want.
Asami says:  Really? Okay ... I've always wanted to see what the Spirit World's like.

Korra says:  Somebody! Help! Please!  Please. 
Tenzin says: I urge you to meditate on these visions. I believe Aang's spirit is trying to tell you something.
Toph says:  What are you doing here, Aang?  I told you, I have this under control.
Aang says:  Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't get involved, but if what those victims said is true, we're not dealing with a normal criminal.
Toph says:  Fine. Follow me, Twinkle Toes.
Aang says:  Toph, I'm forty years old. You think you could stop with the nicknames?
Toph says:  'Fraid not. 
</scene>

<scene>
Toph says:  It's over! You're under arrest, Yakone!
Yakone says:  What is Republic City coming to? Used to be, a man could enjoy his lunch in peace.  What's the big idea?
Aang says: We have dozens of witnesses, Yakone. We know what you are.
Toph says:  Take him away.
Yakone says:  I've beaten every trumped-up charge you yahoos have brought against me!  And I'll beat this one, too.
Korra says:  Whoa.  I finally connected with you, Aang.  But, what are you trying to tell me?  A way out of this box would be nice. 
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says:  I have to go. Call me back the minute you hear anything.  Lin? Wh-wh-what are y- What are y- You should be in the hospital! And you three!  You should be in prison!
Lin says: I figured you could use our help finding Korra.
Mako says:  Do you have any leads?
Tenzin says: I've been on the phone all morning, but nothing yet.
Mako says:  We need Naga! She can track Korra.
Tenzin says: I'm afraid her polar bear dog is missing as well.
Bolin says: Then where do we start?
Lin says: My guess is the Equalists are hiding underground in the maze of tunnels beneath the city.
Asami says:  Underground ... just like my father's secret factory. Figures.
Bolin says:  Yeah! Yeah, that makes sense! When those chi blockers had me in their truck, it sounded like we drove into a tunnel!
Mako says: I know where to start looking! Come on! 
Lin says:  Wherever Amon is keeping Korra, I bet that's where my officers are too.
Tenzin says: Let's bring them all home, Lin.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says:  The truck with Bolin took off down this alley. 
Asami says: Which way?
Bolin says: Hmm. This way kinda ...  smells familiar.
Lin says: There's a tunnel nearby. 
Mako says:  There!
Lin says:  Motorcycle tracks.
Mako says: Korra has to be in there ... somewhere.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Let's try this way.
Asami says: And what if Korra's not down there?
Mako says:  Then we pick another tunnel until we find her! 
</scene>

<scene>
Asami says: Hey, is Mako all right? He seems really worried about Korra.
Bolin says:  Yeah, we all are!
Asami says: I know, but, he's your brother. Do you think that he likes Korra as more than just a friend?
Bolin says:  W-What? No! That's, just gossip, where'd you hear that?  Crazy talk is coming out of your mouth right now. Heh ...
Asami says:  What do you know, Bolin? Come on, spill it.
Bolin says: Nothing! I mean, there was this one time during the tournament when Mako and Korra kissed, but-
Asami says:  They ... kissed? 
Bolin says: Believe me, I was upset too, but, I'm over it. I don't think it meant anything.
Asami says:  I doubt that. 
Lin says: Hide!
Equalist traffic director says: That tram goes to the training camp. 
Female Equalist says: Everything was delivered to the prison, sir. 
Tenzin says:  That's where they must be keeping Korra.
Lin says: We need to get down that tunnel.
Equalist says: It's empty!
Equalist says:  Yeah, I can see that.
Lin says:  You two, keep an eye on them.
Lin says: My officers are inside.
Mako says:  What about Korra?
Lin says: I don't see her yet.
Mako says:  Avatar Korra. Where are you keeping her?
</scene>

<scene>
Officer says:  Chief Beifong?
Lin says: I'm too late. That monster already took your bending, didn't he?
Lin says:  I'm so sorry.  Come on, let's gets you out of here.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says:  I'll ask you one more time;  where is she?
Equalist says:  We don't have the Avatar, and the Equalists didn't attack City Hall. Tarrlok's lying.
Mako says:  What?
Lin says: I scanned the entire prison. Korra's not here.
Mako says:  Why would Tarrlok make up a story about getting attacked?
Tenzin says: Because he has Korra. He fooled us all!
Bolin says: Let's go, people!
Bolin says:  Try to chi block that, fools!
Lin says: We've got more company!  Hang on!
</scene>

<scene>
Prosecution attorney says: Yakone has ruled Republic City's criminal empire for years. Yet he has always managed to stay out of the law's reach, until now. You will hear testimony, from dozens of his victims, and they will tell you, Yakone has maintained his grip on the underworld by using an ability that has been illegal for decades.  Bloodbending. 
Defense attorney says: The prosecution's entire case is built upon the make-believe notion that my client is able to bloodbend at will, at any time on any day. I remind the council that bloodbending is an incredibly rare skill and it can only be performed during a full moon.  Yet, the witnesses will claim that my client used bloodbending at every other time except during a full moon. It would be a mockery of justice to convict a man of a crime that is impossible to commit.
</scene>

<scene>
Bailiff says: Councilman Sokka will now deliver the verdict.
Sokka says: In my years, I have encountered people born with rare and unique bending abilities. Why, I once bested a man with my trusty boomerang who was able to firebend with his mind.  Why, even metalbending was considered impossible for all of history until our esteemed Chief of Police,  Toph Beifong, singlehandedly developed the skill. The overwhelming amount of testimony and evidence has convinced this council that Yakone is one of these unique benders and he exploited his ability to commit these heinous crimes. We find Yakone guilty of all charges and sentence him to life in prison.

Tenzin says: Thank you all for meeting us on such short notice.
Lin says:  Chief.
Saikhan says:  Lin.
Tarrlok says:  Have you news of Avatar Korra?
Tenzin says: We do.  You kidnapped her, Tarrlok!
Tarrlok says:  I am shocked you would accuse me of such an evil act! I already explained: Equalists attacked us and took her!
Tenzin says: But there were no chi blockers here last night.  You planted the evidence, didn't you?
Tarrlok says:  That is a ridiculous accusation!
Council page says:  It's true! He took her! I was here when Avatar Korra arrived last night, but Councilman Tarrlok ordered me to leave. I was on my way out when I saw Tarrlok bring her down to the garage.
Tarrlok says: Say goodbye to Republic City, Avatar Korra. You'll never see it again.
Tarrlok says:  That is nonsense!  Everyone knows you're nothing but a squeaky-voiced liar!
Lin says:  Why did you wait until now to 'fess up?
Council page says:  I was terrified to tell because ...  Because Tarrlok is a bloodbender!  He bloodbent Avatar Korra!
Tenzin says:  Don't make this worse for yourself.  Tell us where you have Korra.
</scene>

<scene>
Lin says: Wake up!
Bolin says:  Ughh! Man! I had this awful dream that Korra was taken by this evil bloodbender.  So weird.
Asami says: Bolin, that really happened. He knocked us out.
Bolin says:  Are you serious?  Where is he? Is he here right now?
Saikhan says: Tarrlok is long gone. I'll alert the whole force. 
Lin says: We've only been out for a little while. Maybe we can still pick up Tarrlok's trail.
Tenzin says: It could lead us to Korra! Let's go. 
</scene>

Aang says:  Yakone.  You won't get away with this!
Yakone says:  Republic City's mine, Avatar. I'll be back one day to claim it.
Yakone says: This time I'm gonna put you to sleep for good!
Aang says: I'm taking away your bending, for good.  It's over.
Korra says:  Aang ... this whole time ... you were trying to warn me about Tarrlok. 
Tarrlok says:  My life is a disaster now, thanks to you.
Korra says: So your little bloodbending secret's out?  And I know how you bloodbent me without a full moon.  You're Yakone's son.
Tarrlok says:  I was his son, but in order to win Republic City, I had to become someone else. My father failed because he tried to rule the city from its rotten underbelly. My plan was perfect. I was to be the city's savior. But you, you ruined everything!
Korra says: Tarrlok, the jig is up and you have nowhere to go.
Tarrlok says: Oh no. No, I'll escape and start a new life. And you're coming as my hostage.
Korra says:  You'll never get away with this!
Tarrlok says:  Amon!
</scene>

<scene>
Amon says: It is time for you to be equalized. 
Tarrlok says: You fool! You've never faced bending like mine.
Tarrlok says:  What? What are you?
Amon says: I am the solution.
</scene>

<scene>
Amon says: I'll take care of him. You four retrieve the Avatar. Do not underestimate her. Electrocute the box to knock her out before you open it. 
Lieutenant says: My pleasure.
Lieutenant says:  It's payback time. 
Lieutenant says:  Open the box.  Tie her up.
</scene>

Amon says:  I thought I told you not to underestimate her.
Korra says: Naga. You came looking for me.  Good girl.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: That sounds like Naga!  Down there!
Tenzin says: Korra! Oh, thank goodness.
Lin says: Where's Tarrlok? How did you get away?
Mako says:  Give her some space!  I was so worried. Are you all right?
Korra says: I'm fine. I'm glad you're here. 
Mako says:  You're safe now.

Shiro Shinobi says:  Lin Beifong has a sister. After arriving in Zaofu, Korra met Opal, a new airbender whose mother is Lin's estranged half-sister. Suyin and her daughter welcomed Lin with open arms, but she wanted nothing to do with them. Meanwhile, Zaheer infiltrated Air Temple Island, looking for the Avatar. After battling with Kya, he escaped and is now a wanted man in Republic City.

Mako says: Hey, has anyone seen Chief Beifong?
Korra says: I think she's still sulking in her room.
Suyin says: I know she has a problem with me, but she had no right to yell at Opal last night.  All set for your power disc game, guys?
Wing says:  Yeah, all set to kick Wei's butt. 
Wei says: I wanna power disc your face.  You should go play with us.
Korra says: Um. I don't think I'd be much competition, since I can't metalbend.
Suyin says: Really. Lin never offered to train you?
Korra says: Nope. And I guessed I never thought to bring it up because I was learning to airbend, then there was the pro-bending, then I got tied up fighting Equalists. It was a busy few months.
Suyin says: Well, it's probably for the best. I'm sure Lin would be a horrible teacher.  As the Avatar, you should have mastery over all the elements. I'd be happy to show you the basics.
Korra says: Really? That would be great!
Opal says:  You should try it, too.
Bolin says:  Uh, nah. I'm more of an earth guy. The dirt, rocks; y'know, maybe some light gravel. That's kinda where my heart is.
Suyin says: Okay, Earth Guy. Well, let me know if you change your mind.

Guard #1 says: How many push-ups did you do last night? 'Cause I did like fifty.
Lin says: What do you two think you're doing?! Get back to work! 
Aiwei says: Is everything all right here?
Lin says: The Avatar is in danger, and these two knuckleheads are just standing around chit-chatting.
Aiwei says: Don't worry, Zaofu is the most secure city in the world.
Lin says: I'll be the judge of that. I'm going to check every inch of this place. 
Aiwei says: Lin, you do not have to work while you are here. You need to relax.
Lin says: I'm fine! 
Aiwei says: It doesn't take a truth seer to know that you are under a dangerous amount of stress. If you don't deal with your suppressed feelings, there will be severe consequences to your health ... and your job.
Lin says: I'm not interested in talking about my feelings.
Aiwei says: You won't have to say a word. I know a great acupuncturist in town who will be able to help you. 
Lin says: Hmm.

P'Li says:  Seems like you made quite the stir on Air Temple Island. The cops are swarming the city looking for us.

Lin says: How many of those things are you going to stick in me?
Guo says: I'll be placing several needles on each of your acu-points. There's nothing to be scared about. 
Lin says: I'm not afraid of needles!
Guo says: Please, close your eyes and take a deep breath.  This process corrects an imbalance in your chi. Please tell me if you feel any pain or pressure.
Lin says: I can't feel a thing.
Guo says: That's unusual. Your chi must be powerfully blocked. We're going to need more needles.  Acupuncture often taps into peoples' buried memories. These memories can sometimes be difficult to process.
Lin says:  Huh, buried memories. Uh-huh.

Lin says: Su, what are you doing home?
Suyin says:  Wow, you almost look like a real cop!
Lin says: You're supposed to be in school.
Suyin says:  Oh no, are you going to tell Mom? It's not like she's going to care.
Lin says:  Where'd you get all that stuff?
Boy says: Oh, it fell off the back of a truck.
Lin says: What are you doing hanging out with these losers?
Suyin says: They're my friends and you have no right to call them that! Come on guys, let's get out of here.
Lin says:  Su, stop.
Suyin says:  Get your hands off of me!
Lin says: You have so much potential. You're ruining your life!
Suyin says: At least I have a life!
Suyin says:  These meteorites are perfect for beginning metalbenders. The metals have a unique property, making them easier to bend.
Korra says: That's amazing! 
Suyin says: Here, try it!
Korra says: Okay.
Korra says: Bolin? Is that you?
Bolin says:  No!
Korra says: What are you doing? 
Bolin says: Oh, hey ladies. Just uh ... I was just looking for Pabu. Pabu!
Korra says: He's on your shoulder.
Bolin says:  Oh, look there you are!  You know, I thought something was chewing on my ear. Probably need to get a shot. Pabu has sort of a ... a venom. Anyways, so what are you guys doing? You metalbending over here or something?
Suyin says: Want to give it a shot?
Bolin says: Nah, it's okay. I mean, only like one earthbender in a hundred can metalbend.
Suyin says: Well, don't believe everything you hear. The only thing limiting you is your attitude.
Bolin says: Well, maybe I'll just ... I'll just stay and watch. 
Suyin says: Try to focus on the fine pieces of earth within the metal. 
Korra says: I can't believe it! I'm metalbending!
Bolin says:  Wow, you picked that up really, really quick. Guess you're that one in a hundred.
Suyin says:  Great job, Korra.

Korra says: Are you going to stay in your room feeling sorry for yourself all day?  You owe Opal an apology for the way you treated her last night. Are you okay? You don't look good. 
Lin says: I'm fine!
Lin says: What did you do to me?
Guo says: I tried to warn you. Come with me. Let's go finish the session.  Just relax and breathe.
Lin says: So, you're robbing stores with the Terra Triad now?
Suyin says: I didn't steal anything. I just drove the car. I owed my friends a favor. It's not a big deal.
Lin says: I'm not letting you get away with this.
Suyin says:  Oh, what are you going to do, Officer? Arrest me? 
Lin says: Don't even think about taking one more step!

Officer says: Good afternoon. Where are you off to today?
Driver says: I, uh, got a delivery to make at Bao Yu. I should be back later today. 
Officer says: You all right?
Driver says: Yeah, just a little tired. One more pick-up, then I'm clocking out.
Officer says: I thought you said you had a delivery?
Driver says:  Did I?
Officer says: I'm going to need you to step out of the vehicle and open the back of the truck.
Zaheer says: Let's get out of here!
Opal says:  Hey, Bolin.
Bolin says:  Opal! Oh, wow, you ... really know how to sneak up on someone.
Opal says: What are you doing?
Bolin says: Oh nothing, you know, just ...  just thinking about my body and mustaches that I might have in the future. 
Opal says: You're acting weird again.
Bolin says: Sorry. I wasn't really thinking about all my mustaches. I'm just frustrated. I've been trying to metalbend and I can't figure it out. Don't tell anyone, okay?
Opal says: Why not?
Bolin says: Because it's embarrassing. This isn't the first time I've tried, and I've been wanting to metalbend ever since I heard about Toph. Your grandmother is my biggest hero!
Opal says:  My mom grew up learning from Toph. Just go train with her. Stop being so scared.
Bolin says: You know what? Maybe I am scared. But what about you? I know that you want to go to the Northern Air Temple to train with Tenzin, but you haven't done it, because you're afraid too!
Opal says: You know what? You're right. I don't want to leave my family and disappoint my mom.
Bolin says: Look at us! Talking about our feelings, supporting each other. 
Opal says: It's nice.
Toph says:  What were you thinking? And what were you thinking? You two have put me in an impossible position.
Lin says: You're mad at me?  She's the one who was running around with criminals!
Suyin says:  This is all your fault!
Lin says: I was doing my job!
Toph says: All right, enough! Here's what we're going to do. Su, you need to leave the city as soon as possible.
Suyin says: What?! Where am I supposed to go?
Toph says: You'll go stay with your grandparents. Lin, give me the arrest report. 
Lin says: Mom, what are you doing?! You can't cover this up! There are witnesses.
Toph says: I'm the Chief of Police! I can't have a daughter in jail!
Lin says: So, once again, Suyin gets to do whatever she wants and there are no consequences. 
Toph says: This is our only option.
Guo says: You're going to feel a bit fragile, so it's probably best if you take it easy for a while.
Lin says:  I don't need to rest. I need to do something I should've done a long time ago.
Suyin says: Congratulations. You're the first metalbending Avatar. 
Bolin says: So, umm, I've been thinking, and I'd like to try to learn metalbending.  I mean, I'm sure you have a waiting list or something of a couple years so.
Suyin says: Let's get started.
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says:  I think Lin is mad about something.
Lin says: Su, it's time we talk.
Suyin says: After thirty years, you're finally ready to talk?
Lin says: When we were in Mom's office that day, you could've taken responsibility for what you did. But instead, you stayed quiet and let Mom throw her whole career away.
Suyin says: Mom didn't throw her career away. She retired the next year. She was a hero.
Lin says: You think she wanted to retire? She was so guilt-ridden about what she did to protect you that she didn't feel worthy of her badge.
Suyin says: Look, I admit that I was not a perfect kid and I've made some mistakes in the past but-
Lin says:  You made some mistakes?
Suyin says:  Lin, Mom and I already talked about this years ago and worked things out. If you had gotten together with us like we'd asked, you would know that I'm a different person now. I've been a different person for a long time.
Lin says: You think that just because you live in a big, fancy house, and have a chef who cooks you fancy food, that you're a different person? Maybe you could fool everyone else, but you can't fool me. I see right through you.
Suyin says: You know what, Lin? You're the one who hasn't changed. You're still a bitter loner who only cares about herself. No wonder Tenzin ended things with you years ago.
Suyin says: Okay,  I guess this is how it's going to be.
Korra says:  Should I stop them?
Bolin says: You don't have any siblings, fighting is all part of the healing process.
Wei says:  Go Mom!
Huan says:  My sculpture!  Actually, it looks ... kinda better now.
Suyin says: You've got it out of your system?
Lin says:  Not quite yet!
Opal says:  What are you two doing?! You're sisters! Why would you want to hurt each other?
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Uhh, Whose going to knock? 
Bolin says: No, no, no, no, no, no! Not me! You're the Avatar, why can't you do it?
Korra says: Uhh, I can. But I just thought that ...
Mako says: I'll do it.  Uhh, Chief, you've been sleeping for sixteen hours. We just wanted to make sure that you're okay.
Lin says:  Good morning. 
</scene>

<scene>
Lin says: What's this?
Chef says: I call it the kalenutsco. It's a mixture of kale, coconut water, and walnuts.
Lin says:  Not bad!  Opal, don't go. Please sit down, I want to talk to you.  Look, I'm just not really comfortable talking about these kinds of things, and ... well, I wanted to say that I'm sorry about the other night.
Opal says: It's okay.
Lin says: Your mother and I have a complicated relationship and ...
Opal says: It's probably difficult for you to be here.
Lin says:  You're a smart young woman, and an excellent airbender. I think it would be a wonderful opportunity to train with the other airbenders at the Northern Air Temple.
Opal says: There's a part of me that wants to go, but ... I don't want to upset my mom.
Lin says: When I was younger, all I wanted to do was please my mother. I became a police chief because I thought it would make her happy ... but it didn't. You need to make your decisions based on what you want. Don't make the same mistakes as I did.
</scene>

<scene>
Opal says: Mom, Dad, can I talk to you?
</scene>

<scene>
Suyin says: Opal has decided to go to the Northern Air Temple. I guess you had something to do with her decision.
Lin says: Well, I was just ...
Suyin says: It's okay. I'm glad she was honest with me. I want her to do what makes her happy. Mom gave us too much freedom, but I feel like I made the mistake of giving Opal too little. I think it's about time I let her choose her own way.  I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time when we were younger. I can't imagine what my life would've been like if Mom hadn't sent me away, if I had stayed in the city ...
Lin says: You'd probably be in prison.
Suyin says: You're probably right. Mako told me that you're an excellent police chief. Republic City is lucky to have you. I know Mom is proud.  Can we move on? I'd love for you to be part of my life again. There's plenty of space in the house, and the kids would love having their aunt around. I do need a new co-director for my new dance performance.
Lin says: Whoa! Slow it down. How about for now, I just promise not to show up at your house and attack you again?
Suyin says: Deal!

Meanwhile, Korra and Asami tried to escape their captors, but crashed in the desert. After getting to safety, they met up with Lord Zuko, Tonraq, and Beifong.

Mako says: This isn't our battle.  We have to deliver Zaheer's message to Korra immediately.
Bolin says: Right. Okay, find Korra, deliver message.  Yeah, this should be easy. We just got to get out of the city and get to the desert, then somehow find her in the vast expansive wasteland that goes on for thousands, and thousands, of miles.  This isn't gonna be easy.
Mako says:  We need an airship.
Mako says: Excuse me, may I have your attention please? I'm with the Republic City Police and I need to commandeer this airship to help the Avatar.
Bolin says: Let me give it a shot.  Hey, the Queen's gold's on the third floor of the palace, second door on the right!  You just got to know how to talk to 'em, bro. 
Mako says: What, they took everything. I mean, who rips out a transmission radio?
Bolin says: Some folks just do not have respect for other people's property.  Now let's steal this airship!
Mako says: You know how to fly this thing?
Bolin says: Technically speaking, no. But, c'mon, how hard could it be?
Mako says: Up! Up!
Bolin says: I don't see any up button. I see levers and switches, oh, there it is.

Mako says: Yeah.

Bolin says: Grandma, there's one thing Mako and I've learned from all our years on the street. It doesn't matter where you go.  If you have your family with you, you'll always be at home.
Yin says:  I'm not going.
Bolin says: Fine!  You leave me no choice.  We're rolling out!
Yin says: Wait.  Okay, let's go!
</scene>

<scene>
Tu says: Thanks for getting us out of there. I mean, I probably could have handled it myself if you guys didn't show up, but, thanks.
Yin says:  May she rest in peace.  This airship is nice. Is it our new home?
Mako says: No, Grandma. I'm not sure where we're gonna take you, but right now, we need to find Korra.
Chow says: Did something happen to the Avatar?
Mako says:  I'm afraid so.  Her airship went down somewhere in the desert. She was coming from a military base near the Misty Palms Oasis and heading to Ba Sing Se. If we retrace her route back to the base, we should find the wreckage.
</scene>

<scene>
Tu says: Guys, it's the wreckage!  I found it!  There!
Mako says: That's a Ba Sing Se airship, all right. But where's the rest of it?
Bolin says: I don't know. But there's some tracks.
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: See, I told you. Landing is hard.
</scene>

<scene>
Female relative says:  Spirits!
Bolin says: Okay, guys. We think Korra found her way back here.  Now let's split off into teams and scour the town. Yes, we'll need your help too, Pabu, now just give me a second while I- wait, Pabu? Pabu! 
Yin says:  Why is Bolin hugging that big rat?  Eww,  now he's kissing it!
Bolin says:  I'm never gonna let you go again!
Tu says: Guys, look out! Giant dog beast thingy!
Mako says: Okay, all right, Naga. It's good to see you, too. Gah! Stop! You're licking my mouth. 
Bolin says:  Asami! Korra!
Mako says: You guys are okay!
Mako says:  Sorry. I was just- It's so good to see you.
Korra says: It's really good to see you, too.  Both of you.
Lin says: Good. You guys aren't dead.
Mako says: Don't get all mushy on me, Chief.  Tonraq. Sir. 
Bolin says:  Oh my gosh, it's Lord Zuko! I can't believe it. 
Mako says: Uhm,  forgive my brother. We're just really honored to meet you, Sir. 
Zuko says:  It's a pleasure to meet you as well.
Yin says:  You must be the Avatar.  Mako told me so much about you. You are even more beautiful than I imagined.
Mako says:  Uh, actually, that's Asami. This is Avatar Korra. Korra, this is my grandma, Yin.
Yin says:  You are very muscular for a woman.
Korra says: Uhm, thanks. You too?
Yin says: What lovely young women. Mako, why aren't you dating any nice girls like them? 
Asami says: Uh, so what happened to you two? Where have you been?
Mako says: We were captured by Zaheer and taken to Ba Sing Se. We were there when the Earth Queen was overthrown.
Korra says: What? How did you escape?
Mako says: Zaheer let us go.
Korra says: What? Why would he do that?
Bolin says: Because he wanted us to find you and deliver a message.
Mako says: Zaheer is headed to the Northern Air Temple as we speak. He said he's gonna wipe out the new Air Nation and everyone in it. Unless you turn yourself over to him.
Korra says: Zaheer's threatening innocent lives just to get to me.
Tonraq says: He could be bluffing.
Mako says: He's already taken out the Earth Queen. I don't think he bluffs.
Korra says: We need to radio Tenzin and warn him that the Red Lotus is coming.
Mako says: I agree. Unfortunately, we don't have a radio on the airship.
Tonraq says: There's a portable radio on the jeep, but the signal will never make it to the Northern Air Temple.
Lin says: We need to get to a place that has a strong radio transmitter. The Metal Clan will have one.
Korra says: Let's go. We'll radio Su on the way. Hopefully she can get a hold of Tenzin at the air temple by the time we get to Zaofu.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Did you have any luck getting through to Tenzin?
Suyin says:  No one's answering. What if Zaheer's already up there? I should never have let Opal go.
Lin says: It's going to be okay, Su.
Suyin says: I hope so.
</scene>

<scene>
Radio operator says: We have a strong signal, but no one's answering.
Korra says:  I can't just sit around here while a madman is on his way to the Northern Air Temple. We have to do something.
Suyin says: I'll ready my airship. With a full force of the Metal Clan security backing us, we can take them. 
Mako says: We'll never make it up there before Zaheer.
Korra says: There might be another way to stop him. It's a long shot, but Zaheer is always meditating into the Spirit World. And I know exactly where he goes: Xai Bau's Grove. If I can find him there, maybe I could somehow trap him.
Lin says: We can't protect you in there. I don't like it.
Korra says: I'll be fine. I have to try.
Asami says: I'll watch over her as she meditates.
Bolin says: I guess, in the meantime, Mako and I will stay here and try to get through to the temple.
Tonraq says: We'll help Su ready the airship.
Yin says: I'm going to take a nap.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Zaheer! Come out! Face me! Leave the airbenders out of this!  There you are.
Iroh says: Please don't hurt me, Korra. I'm just an old man.
Korra says: Iroh? What are you doing here?
Iroh says: I was just out searching for a new teapot to add to my collection. But instead, I found you.  In the Spirit World, you always seem to find something you don't know you were looking for.  You look troubled.
Korra says: I am.
Iroh says: Sit.  What is on your mind?
Korra says: There's a maniac on the loose and he's threatening to destroy the new Air Nation. I don't know what to do.
Iroh says: Just because you are the Avatar, doesn't mean you will have all the answers.
Korra says: I know many Avatars have needed guidance. But I'm the only one since Avatar Wan that can't get help from my past lives. I wish I could talk to Aang.
Iroh says: You know, Zuko and Aang were close friends.
Korra says: Lord Zuko, of course.
Iroh says: Yes, my nephew. Their relationship started off  a little rocky, but they grew to become lifelong friends. Best friends.
Korra says: Thank you! Thank you so much. You're right about the Spirit World. I came here looking for someone else, but I'm glad I found you.
Asami says: Did you find Zaheer?
Korra says: No, he wasn't there. But there's someone I need to talk to.  You're leaving? Aren't you coming to the air temple with us?
Zuko says: I'm sorry, but I can't. I'm going back to the Fire Nation. If it's true that the Red Lotus is targeting the nations' leaders, I need to protect my daughter.
Korra says: I understand. You have to keep the Fire Lord safe. But before you leave, I was wondering if you could help me with something.
Zuko says: I was often Aang's counsel and I'd love to be yours.
Korra says: That just it. You knew Aang better than anyone. I was wondering if you knew what he might do if he were in my situation.
Zuko says: Hmm. Rebuilding the Air Nation was Aang's biggest dream. He would be beside himself with joy with what you've done. And if he accomplished that goal, he might have sacrificed anything to protect it.
Korra says: So he would give himself up to save the Air Nation?
Zuko says: I don't know for sure. The airbenders might have been closest to Aang's heart, but, as the Avatar, he was concerned with people of all nations. No one knew better than Aang that in times of turmoil,  the world needs its Avatar the most.
Korra says: Thanks. Your uncle was right. It was helpful talking to you.
Zuko says: Wait, you spoke with my uncle?
Korra says: Yes. In the Spirit World. A couple of times actually. 
Mako says: Guys. We got through to the air temple.
Meelo says: Who is this?
Bolin says:  I told you, it's Bolin!
Meelo says:  Bolin's not here right now. Can I take a message?
Bolin says: No! I'm not looking for Bolin, I am Bolin! Gah, look, I need you to find your dad.
Meelo says: He's outside with the bison. Did you know we found a whole herd full of baby bison?
Bolin says: No, a whole herd? Really?
Korra says:  Meelo, this is your commanding officer. Go get your dad, now!
Meelo says:  Yes, sir!
Korra says: Come on, come on!
Tenzin says: Hello? This is Tenzin.
Korra says: Tenzin! Listen to me carefully. Zaheer is on his way to the temple. He's coming for the airbenders. You have to get everyone out of there immediately. Drop everything. Leave! Now!
Tenzin says: Oh no.
Korra says:  What? What is it? Tenzin! Tenzin, what's happening?!
Tenzin says: It's too late.  He's here.
</scene>

<scene>
Meelo says:  What is it, Daddy?
Tenzin says:  We need to get everyone out of here.  Stay close to me.
Bumi says:  What's going on, Tenzin?
Tenzin says: It's Zaheer.  Round everyone up! We need to get to the bison and evacuate immediately!
</scene>

<scene>
Kai says: Guys, we got an emergency. We're evacuating the temple.  Come on.
Kai says: Look out!
</scene>

<scene>
Bumi says:  It's Zaheer! We have to leave.
</scene>

<scene>
Ming Hua says: No one's going anywhere, or she gets it.
</scene>

<scene>
Zaheer says: Good. The entire family is here.
Zaheer says: It's a pleasure to finally meet a true airbending master.
Tenzin says: What is it you want from us?
Zaheer says: Nothing at all. In fact, if everyone cooperates, you will all walk out of this situation unharmed.
Tenzin says: Then what are you doing here?
Zaheer says: I want Korra, and I'm tired of chasing her.
Tenzin says: You're using us as leverage.
Zaheer says: Yes.
Tenzin says:  I will never let you get to Korra.
Zaheer says: Unfortunately, you don't have a choice.
Tenzin says: Yes, I do.
Tenzin says: Jinora! Get everyone out of here. Bumi, Kya, help me hold them off!  And stay out of her line of sight! Go, go!
</scene>

<scene>
Pema says: It's too dangerous. We'll never make it to the stables with her up there.
</scene>

Kya says: No.
Bumi says: I see you're having as much fun as I am.
</scene>

<scene>
Kai says: I can't wait any longer. 
Jinora says: Wait, what are you doing?
Kai says: Whatever I can.  Get to the bison! Get out of here!

Jinora says:  Kai! No.
</scene>

Bumi says: I got you.
Kya says: Bumi, let go!
Bumi says: But we could die!
Kya says: We're gonna die if we hang on!

Zaheer says: Give up. It's over.
Tenzin says: As long as I'm breathing, it's not over.

Shiro Shinobi says:  Bolin, Opal, and Lin rescued the Beifongs and Zhu Li from Kuvira. Now they are racing to Republic City to alert everyone about the Earth Empire's imminent attack. Meanwhile, Korra and Team Avatar have been preparing for just such an event. Prince Wu is leading an evacuation effort, while Asami and Varrick are creating flying mecha suits. But with Kuvira planning to strike in only two weeks, will they be ready in time?
</scene>

<scene>
Kuvira says: Today, we stand on the precipice of history. For the past three years,  we've fought side by side to unite the Earth Empire and we've proven that no one can stand in our way,  not even the Avatar. But our mission is not yet complete.
</scene>

<scene>
Kuvira says:  There is a grave injustice that must be corrected. As you all know, after the Hundred Year War, Avatar Aang,  along with Fire Lord Zuko, stole Earth Empire land and formed the United Republic.  This land belongs to the people of the Earth Empire and it's time to take it back! Republic City will be ours!
Soldiers says: All hail the Great Uniter!
Kuvira says: Are you ready to show the world what a true superpower looks like?
Baatar Jr. says:  Yes. I'm honored to march into the city by your side.  I love you, Kuvira.
Kuvira says: I never could have done this without your help. After we claim victory, we can finally get married  and rule our empire together.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: How's the evacuation coming?
Wu says: Could be better.  At this point we've evacuated almost ...  eighteen families.
Korra says:  Only eighteen? There are millions of people in this city!
Wu says: I said it could be better.
Mako says: The problem is, it's a voluntary evacuation and there aren't very many volunteers. They just don't feel like they're in any immediate danger.
Bolin says: Guys! Good, you're all here!
Raiko says:  What's with you interrupting my important meetings all the time?
Korra says:  Su ... what are you ... you're okay!  I'm so sorry about Zaofu. How did you escape?
Bolin says: Opal, Beifong, and I rescued everyone. But we had a run in with Kuvira. We saw her super spirit weapon up close. Like, really close. Way too close.
Tenzin says: Is she going to use it against Republic City?
Zhu Li says: Yes. I found out she's going to attack in two weeks.
Bolin says: Ooh! And Zhu Li's on our side now. Actually, she never really switched sides and I'm just gonna let her explain the whole thing. Zhu Li?
Zhu Li says:  I pretended to be loyal to Kuvira so I could sabotage her weapon. It didn't work, but I did overhear her plans to attack.
Raiko says:  I knew she wouldn't stop at Zaofu.
Lin says: My guess is, she's coming by rail. It's the only way she can transport that weapon.
Korra says: Then we'll cut the rail lines.
Raiko says: I agree. But let's get as many citizens evacuated before we do.  Put out the announcement. The evacuation is now mandatory.
Mako says:  We're on it.
Korra says: Don't worry Mr. President. I won't let Kuvira take our city.
</scene>

<scene>
Varrick says: Weld hotter! Tighten tighter!  The president said we only have two weeks to get these hummingbirds humming!
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: Varrick! Good, you're here.  Can I talk to you for a minute?
Varrick says:  What is it? I'm busy inspiring my workers.
Bolin says: Well, I went to Zaofu and saved Su and her family ... and guess who else we found?  Ha!
Varrick says: Zhu Li.
Bolin says:  Now, isn't there something you wanted to say to her? Hmm?
Zhu Li says:  Please, let me go first. I know I said a lot of terrible things about you in front of Kuvira. But I need you to know ...  I didn't mean one word. When you were being taken away, I thought my only chance to save you was to join her.  But every day, I hoped for the chance to see you again and tell you the truth.  Varrick, you mean the world to me and I'm sorry if I hurt you in any way.
Varrick says:  Don't be so hard on yourself.  Apology accepted! Now be a good assistant and  man the assembly line!
Zhu Li says:  No! I am not your assistant anymore.  If you want me around, you need to start treating me like an equal!
</scene>

<scene>
Radio operator says:  We're patched into the emergency broadcast line.  You're going out to every radio in the city.
Mako says:  Attention citizens of Republic City. This is not a test.  An attack on our city is imminent. President Raiko has ordered a mandatory evacuation for all citizens. Please find  your evacuation handbooks and turn to  subsection one-dash-two-six.  There you will find initial instructions for your area. For example, if you live in northwest vector one, report to your primary meeting location,  which would be at the eastern entrance of the Southern Water Tribe library.  There, you would choose a leader as specified in section one-dash-two-eight. 
Radio operator says:  Uh, Chief,  we're getting confused calls from all over the city. I think Mako's starting a panic.
Mako says: What's confusing?  I'm giving very specific instructions.
Lin says:  Great, this is just what we need.
Wu says: I got this.  Hello, everyone, this is Prince Wu. Now, I know you're all a little scared. Believe me, I know what it's like to be afraid. I used to not be able to go to the bathroom by myself. But if we let that fear control us  none of us will ever be able to go to the bathroom and then we all lose.  But the people of Republic City aren't losers, we're winners.  Winners that are going to  get out of this city in a calm and orderly fashion.  So I want you to grab your family, grab your neighbor  grab that guy down the street you don't know very well and head to the nearest bus,  train or ferry station.  We're going to get you out of here, safe and sound.
</scene>

<scene>
Lin says:  Good job, kid.  You might not make such a bad king after all.
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says: Rohan's with the Acolytes. They have the boat ready to leave.  Why aren't you all packed yet?
Pema says:  The kids and I have been talking and we decided we want to stay. This is our city and it's going to need all the help it can get.
Meelo says:  Yeah! Only a coward flees his fate.
Tenzin says:  Thank you.  I'm sure Prince Wu could use your help with the evacuation.  And you three can help the other airbenders keep an eye on the Earth Empire troops from above.
Meelo says:  Kuvira's gonna rue the day she messed with  Meelo.
</scene>

<scene>
Raiko says:  I still don't like having to abandon my office in the city.
</scene>

<scene>
Lin says: Air Temple Island is the ideal location for your base of operations and you'll be safe here.
Korra says:  There's something we need to discuss with you.
Tenzin says: What is it?
Korra says:  The four of us have been talking and ... we wanna take out Kuvira's spirit weapon before it gets too close to the city.
Tenzin says:  That sounds like a risk we don't need to take. The evacuation is on schedule and General Iroh is getting his army in place.
Korra says:  I know Iroh can go toe-to-toe with Kuvira's army, but that weapon ...
Bolin says: It's too powerful! It can destroy the city.
Mako says: We can't let it get to our doorstep.
Korra says: We'll sneak behind enemy lines and disable the weapon.
Asami says: If it works, it'll even the playing field.
Tenzin says: But if you get caught ...
Korra says: It's worth the risk.
Raiko says:  I agree, and it might be our only shot at preventing an all-out war.  Good luck.
Korra says:  We'll head out tonight.
</scene>

<scene>
Sentry says: There's something out there!
</scene>

<scene>
Sentry says:  It's Kuvira's army!  They're a week early! Get the commander immediately and radio Republic City!
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: Guys! I see something.  Down there! 
Asami says: Is that – ?
Korra says: Kuvira.  She's already crossed into United Republic territory. She's a week early.
Mako says: This doesn't make sense.  There aren't any train tracks this way. How are they transporting that super weapon of theirs? 
Asami says: Apparently on a giant mecha suit!
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says:  Did you know Kuvira was building that thing?
Bolin says:  Oh, did I forget to mention it? No, of course I didn't know!
</scene>

<scene>
Mecha operator says: There's a flying bison up ahead.
Kuvira says: The Avatar. 
Bolin says:  I know what happens next! We gotta get out of here, now! Now! 
Baatar Jr. says: Should we go after them? They're going to warn Republic City.
Kuvira says:  Let them. No one can stop us.
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says: Korra? Are you all right? Why are you back so soon?
Korra says: It's Kuvira. Our intel was wrong. She must have known Zhu Li had the information.
Raiko says: What are you trying to say?
Korra says: Kuvira's army is only a few hours away.
Tenzin says: No, they can't be! We're not ready.
Korra says: And that spirit weapon of hers is attached to a giant mecha suit. It's over twenty-five stories tall!
Raiko says:  Get General Iroh on the line and tell him that the attack is happening today. We need to lock down the city. 
Tenzin says: Pema! Find Wu and get the remaining citizens to safety, immediately.  We can't have innocent lives in jeopardy.
Bolin says: What should we do?
Asami says: Let's go to my factory. Maybe we can get a few of those hummingbird suits up and running.
Suyin says: We're coming with you. 
Korra says: I'll head to the front lines and help General Iroh.
</scene>

<scene>
Raiko says: Kuvira, this is President Raiko. I order you to stand down. Turn your army around and leave.
Kuvira says:  You're in no position to give orders.
Raiko says:  Stand down, or we will attack!
Kuvira says: I don't think you understand the power I possess.  Let me make it clear.
</scene>

<scene>
Varrick says:  This is exactly why I didn't wanna build that weapon!
</scene>

<scene>
Iroh says:  Mister President, do I have your order to engage?
Kuvira says:  You have three seconds before I wipe out your army.
Raiko says: I have no choice.
Kuvira says:  Time's up!
Raiko says: Stop! We surrender. Republic City is yours.
</scene>

<scene>
Kuvira says: Good. Turn your army and the Avatar over to me, and give Baatar your location.  He'll present you with our terms.
Korra says:  I'm not surrendering!
Iroh says: Get back to the city before she sees you. And Korra --  --find a way to beat that thing.
Korra says:  I will.
</scene>

<scene>
Baatar Jr. says: We've done it, Kuvira.  And I just got word that President Raiko is on Air Temple Island. I'm heading there now.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Raiko surrendered.  It's down to us now.
Bolin says:  How are we supposed to fight an entire army, a mecha giant, and that crazy weapon?
Asami says: We can't fight it, but maybe we can cripple it.  Zhu Li, when you were spying on Kuvira, did you learn anything about that metal monster?
Zhu Li says: I had no idea they were even building it.
Varrick says: Guess Baatar Jr. is a better inventor than I thought.  Don't tell him I said that.
Korra says:  That's it! Baatar Jr. built it, he'll know how to take it down! I say we capture him, and get him to talk.
Tenzin says: Hmm ...
Korra says:  I know it's a long shot, but it's the only chance we have, and if we don't ...
Tenzin says:  Korra, I'm in.
Korra says: We'll need a stealth team of airbenders to get in and out of Baatar's airship unnoticed. Tenzin, Bumi, Jinora, Kai, let's get moving.
Meelo says:  What about me?
Korra says:  Sorry, buddy. This mission counts on everyone being as silent as possible -  - and your farts are just too much of a wild card.
Meelo says:  I can be quiet!  Okay, point taken.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Is everyone ready?
</scene>

<scene>
Baatar Jr. says: You've made a terrible mistake.  Once Kuvira finds out I'm missing, you're all done for.
Korra says: That's why, before she finds out, you're going to tell us how to stop that mecha giant, or else.
Baatar Jr. says: Or else what?
</scene>

<scene>
Baatar Jr. says:  You won't hurt me. I know an empty threat when I see one.
</scene>

<scene>
Baatar Jr. says: Was this your best idea?  You've lost, only you haven't accepted it yet.
</scene>

<scene>
Suyin says: Let me talk to him.
</scene>

<scene>
Soldier #1 says: Are you sure?
Soldier #2 says: Check the engine room.
Raiko says:  What's going on? Is everything all right?
Soldier #3 says:  Just a minute, sir.  I'm telling you, I looked everywhere.
Lin says:  All right, enough whispering!
Raiko says: I'm ready to discuss the terms of the surrender with Baatar Jr. Where is he?
Soldier #3 says: Uh ... I'm not really sure.
</scene>

<scene>
Suyin says: Baatar --
Baatar Jr. says: If you think I'm going to spill all my secrets to you, Mother, you're sadly mistaken.
Suyin says: Why are you doing this? I know you set out to help better the world, but this is madness!
Baatar Jr. says: It's madness to let others take what's yours and accept it blindly! The United Republic belongs to us, and we're taking it back.
Suyin says: But at what cost? How many people have to lose their lives before Kuvira is satisfied?
Baatar Jr. says:  It doesn't have to cost any lives if you would all just surrender! All that Kuvira and I want is a united Earth Empire!
Suyin says:  I don't know what I did to hurt you, but whatever it was, I'm sorry. When you left Zaofu, it broke my heart --  -- and our family has never been the same since. Please, Baatar -- stop all this and come home.  We want you back with us.
Baatar Jr. says:  Kuvira is my family now.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: We've been going about his all wrong.  You're right. I'm not gonna physically hurt you if you don't talk. But there is something I could do that will be even more painful.  I will take away the one thing you care for the most ... Kuvira.
Baatar Jr. says: What do you mean?
Korra says: Kuvira might win. She might chase us out of the city. But you won't be around to enjoy the victory. Because wherever I run, I'll take you. I am going to make it my life's mission to never let you see the one you love again.  Is taking the city worth losing Kuvira forever?
Baatar Jr. says:  No! You can't!
Korra says: I will ... unless you convince Kuvira to back off. You two will still have the Earth Empire. Just leave the United Republic alone.
</scene>

<scene>
Soldier #4 says: It's Kuvira. She wants to talk to Baatar. What should I tell her?
Raiko says: For goodness' sake, give me that radio! Let me talk to her.
Raiko says: Kuvira, this is Raiko. What kind of game are you playing? You told me you would send Baatar over with your terms, and then he doesn't show.
Kuvira says:  What do you mean, "he didn't show"?
Raiko says: According to your people, he's not on the airship.
Kuvira says:  If he's not on the airship, then where is he?
Baatar Jr. says:  Kuvira? It's Baatar.  I've been captured. My airship was ambushed and I was taken by force. Korra refuses to release me unless we back down and leave the city.
Kuvira says:  Are you injured?
Baatar Jr. says:  I'm fine.
Kuvira says: Is the Avatar there with you now?
Baatar Jr. says: Yes, everyone is here.
Kuvira says: Find out where that signal's coming from.
Baatar Jr. says: Listen to me.  If you try to take Republic City, the Avatar will never let me see you again ... and I refuse to live that way.  Forget the United Republic; we have our empire! We have each other!  Let's go back home and get married. The only thing that matters is that we're together for the rest of our lives.
</scene>

<scene>
Mecha operator says: We've identified their position.
Kuvira says: You're right. This city isn't worth sacrificing our life together.  I love you, Baatar.

By connecting with the original Avatar, Korra learned that to stop Unalaq she must close the spirit portal before Harmonic Convergence, which is only weeks away! Meanwhile, Varrick has made Bolin into a mover star and saved Asami's company. Mako is the only one who suspects that Varrick is up to no good, but can he prove it?

Bumi says: It's true. I once beat an earthbender in a rock-throwing contest! I have the trophy to prove it.
Tenzin says: All right, who's ready for an exciting tour of the Eastern Air Temple? We've got a lot to see today, including ancient statues, ancient gardens,  and the meditation hall used by ancient airbenders.
Ikki says:  Yay. Old things.
Tenzin says:  Korra?
Jinora, Ikki and Meelo says:  Korra! Yay, Korra! Korra's back! 
Pema says: What are you doing here?
Ikki says:  Oh, I've missed you!
Kya says: And how did you know where to find us?
Korra says: Tenzin's itinerary. We went over it like a hundred times before we left Republic City.
Tenzin says:  See? This is why schedules are important.
Korra says: It's so great to see you all again.
Tenzin says: It's great to see you too, but why aren't you training at the South Pole?
Korra says:  Wait, you don't know about the Civil War?
Tenzin says:  What? No. We've been out of touch with the outside world since we started our vacation.
Bumi says: Tenzin's idea. What happened?
Korra says: So much. I-I don't know where to start.
Tenzin says: Just tell us everything!
Korra says: Everything?  Okay. I opened a spirit portal at the South Pole, but then Unalaq turned out to be a bad guy and wanted to take control of the South, so I sort of started a Civil War, but when I went to find some help, I was attacked by my cousins, and then by a giant dark spirit, and then I forgot who I was, and then I met the first Avatar, and then I realized I shouldn't have opened the portal in the first place, and now I need to close it again!
Tenzin says: I knew this would happen.  So Avatar Wan imprisoned this dark spirit Vaatu in the Spirit World?
Korra says: Yes, and now I think my uncle is trying to free him.
Tenzin says: I knew Unalaq was hungry for power, but never realized how far he would go to get it.
Korra says: This is all my fault.
Tenzin says: No, don't blame yourself. This is Unalaq's doing. Now, we must focus on setting things right before he can do any more damage.
Korra says: Thank you.
Tenzin says: So, you need to close the Southern portal, but if Unalaq's army controls the South, how are we going to get to it?
Korra says: I thought about that. My best chance to close the portal is from the inside.  I have to enter the Spirit World.
Tenzin says: A journey to the Spirit World. All my years of spiritual training have prepared me for this moment.  I will help you. Today, we enter the Spirit World.

Desna says: Father, what are we doing here?
Unalaq says: You're here to straighten out the mess you caused when you failed to capture the Avatar.
Desna says: I told you, it wasn't our fault.
Unalaq says: You're right. It was my fault for trusting you. Harmonic Convergence is almost upon us. This is my opportunity to change the world.
Eska says: We'll make it up to you, Father.
Unalaq says: Good, because I'll need your help to open the northern portal.
Desna says:  I thought only the Avatar could do it.
Unalaq says: I believe there is another way.

Asami says: Varrick invited me to watch some of the filming.  Are you filming right now?
Bolin says: Right now? Nope. We're uh ... we're at lunch.
Mako says:  Asami, there you are. Is Bolin around?
Bolin says:  Up here. 
Mako says: Good. I've got something to tell you both.
Bolin says:  Ahh! Ow, aww. Oh, I got to stop doing my own stunts.
Mako says: I found out who's been stealing from Future Industries:  Varrick.
Bolin says: What? No.
Asami says:  He attacked his own ship?
Mako says: Yes! It was a ploy. He wants Republic City to go to war, and he wants control of the businesses that stand to profit the most from it. He already had all the shipping. All he needed was Future Industries.
Asami says: Varrick helped save Future Industries. He's my business partner now, not an evil mastermind.  Mako, you seemed stressed.
Mako says: I am stressed!
Bolin says: See, this is why I had to move out.
Asami says: You guys aren't living together anymore?
Bolin says: Nope. It was time for this eagle hawk to spread his wings and fly. 
Asami says:  Sounds like you've had a pretty busy week.  Maybe you just need to relax.
Bolin says:  Wait a minute. Are you two—  you're dating again? What?
Mako says: Dating? No!
Asami says: That's crazy!
Bolin says: Korra just left a week ago!
Mako says:  Guys, listen to me. Varrick is up to no good, and I have proof. The detonators he uses in his movers are exactly like the one I found at the cultural center attack.  And those explosions were exactly like the ones the captain reported when Asami's shipment was hijacked. Don't you see?
Asami says:  Anyone could have gotten their hands on one of those detonators.
Bolin says: Yeah. Let it go, Mako.  Let it go.
Mako says:  Gah! No! I'm not going to let it go!

Korra says:  Are you in the Spirit World?
Tenzin says:  I would be if Meelo could ring his bell at the appropriate intervals.

Korra says:  I thought your bell ringing was just fine.

Tenzin says: No talking. Feel the energy of the universe.
Korra says: Okay, I feel it.
Tenzin says:  Korra, really! I'm trying to concentrate here! I don't think this location is going to work either.
Korra says: What's going on with you? First, you're blaming Meelo, then Kya, and now me.
Tenzin says: Well, nothing is feeling right to me.
Korra says: I don't want to rush your feelings, but we're kind of in a hurry. How did you first get into the Spirit World? Let's try that.
Tenzin says: Well ... actually, I've never been into the Spirit World.
Korra says: You've never been into the Spirit World?
Pema says: But you used to spend days in the temple meditating.
Tenzin says: Trying to get in. It never happened. It's my greatest shortcoming as an airbender, spiritual leader, and son of Aang.
Bumi says:  Welcome to the "I Disappoint Dad" club.
Kya says: If you've never been to the Spirit World, how were you planning to get Korra into it?
Tenzin says: I've spent years studying the techniques and theories of ancient spiritual leaders. Now that the Avatar needs me, it must be my time.
Korra says: Tenzin, Harmonic Convergence is almost here. If Vaatu escapes from the Spirit World—
Tenzin says: You have to trust me. I can help you.
Kya says: There might be another way. Jinora, is there something you want to tell Korra?
Tenzin says: Jinora? She's too young and untrained to have any knowledge about spiritual matters.
Jinora says: Actually, I think I do know where Korra needs to go to get into the Spirit World.
Tenzin says: And how would you know that?
Jinora says: My spirit friends showed me.  It's okay. You can show yourselves. 
Tenzin says: How did you do that?
Pema says:  Jinora.
Meelo says:  Bunnies!
Jinora says: Actually, they're dragonfly bunny spirits.
Kya says: I knew it. Looks like she does know something about spiritual matters.
Ikki says: So cute!
Meelo says: Bunnies!
Ikki says: Come back!
Tenzin says: How long have you been able to do this?
Jinora says: I don't know.  I guess I've always kind of had a connection with spirits. 
Bumi says:  I think this one likes me.
Korra says: Are they here to help? 
Jinora says: I think they want you to go down there.
Tenzin says: I don't know. The spiritual energy is historically strongest near the temple.
Korra says: No offense, but I'm guessing the spirits have actually been to the Spirit World, so I'm gonna follow them.
Bumi says:  If we need to go to the Tenzin World, we'll call you.

Eska says: Father, haven't the spirits had ten thousand years to open this portal?
Desna says: If they could not succeed, what makes you think we will?
Unalaq says: By entering the Spirit World through the portal, we bring with us something the spirits never had: our bending.  Join me! Together, we can open this portal.
Eska says:  Desna!
Unalaq says: Leave him! Keep bending! 
Eska says:  He needs a healer at once!
Unalaq says: This is more important!
Eska says:  I'm taking him back.

Varrick says: I hear you've got some ideas. You wanna tell me about them?
Mako says: Go ahead. Torture me all you want. I'm not gonna talk.
Varrick says: Torture? The only thing I want to torture is this pesky foot fungus.  Ah! Eee! Ooh! The burning means it's working.  I heard you've been investigating the recent attacks on my ships, and I think you know that I know that you know, you know?
Mako says: Know what?
Varrick says: That the world is a dangerous place, and that's exactly why I want to offer you a job on my security force.
Mako says: I have a job.
Varrick says: We need you. Me, Asami, Bolin. We're all in the same team here. We want you to join us. You wouldn't want anything to happen to Asami, would you? I mean, I heard you and her were kind of, uh, an item again. Or what about your brother?
Mako says: What are you saying?
Varrick says:  I'm saying I want your help to protect them. Without you, who knows what could happen.
Mako says: Thanks for your concern, but the answer is no.

Bumi says:  Oh, you are just so cute. I'm going to name you Bum-Ju. It's short for "Bumi Junior".  Don't you think he looks like me?
Tenzin says:  The resemblance is uncanny.
Jinora says:  I think Dad's mad at me.
Kya says:  Your father's not mad. His pride's just a little bruised since he isn't able to see spirits like you.
Korra says: You have a natural gift. That's pretty lucky.
Jinora says: You're the lucky one. You actually got to meet the first Avatar. I know about a lot of Avatars, but I don't know anything about him. Is it even a him? Or is it her?
Korra says: It's a him, Avatar Wan. He was amazing. I saw how he became the first Avatar by fusing with Raava, the Spirit of Light.
Jinora says: The Avatar is part spirit? Of course! Just like the statue.
Kya says: What statue?
Jinora says: When we were at the Southern Air Temple, I was drawn to this old carving. I couldn't figure out what it was until now. It was the first Avatar.
Korra says: When did this happen?
Jinora says: It was on the solstice.
Korra says: That's the day I opened the Southern portal.
Korra and Jinora says: Whoa.
Bumi says:  We're here!
Tenzin says: Are you sure these spirits are leading us into the right place?
Bumi says: Of course! I trust Bum-Ju with my life.
Korra says: Look. There are carvings on them.
Tenzin says: This is an ancient airbender meditation circle.
Jinora says: There's a lot of spiritual energy in this place, but it feels really strange.
Tenzin says: We'll have to perform a spiritual cleansing ceremony.
Bumi says: What are you talking about?
Tenzin says: Dad taught it to me. This site has been neglected for many years. A cleansing ceremony will help strengthen its connections to the Spirit World.
Bumi says:  Good job, you cleansed the area of the only spirits that want to help us, and you scared away Bum-Ju.
Tenzin says: It's working.
Bumi says: Ah! Bats! Evil bats! 
Korra says: Not bats. Dark spirits.
Tenzin says: What are we supposed to do?
Kya says:  Amazing.

Tenzin says: Your spiritual training has come a long way.
Korra says: Unalaq may be a horrible person, but his spirit powers are no joke.
Tenzin says:  He taught you how to transform dark spirits. I can't even get you into the Spirit World.
Korra says: Everything Unalaq taught me was to help himself. Everything you've done was meant to help me. I am so sorry for turning my back on you as my mentor. I need you now more than ever.
Tenzin says: I won't let you down.
Tenzin says: The ancient airbenders must have built this site. If we meditate here, we'll be able to enter the Spirit World.
Korra says: Why don't you go first?
Tenzin says: After all these years, my father's dreams for me will finally come true.

Mako says: Did you come by to tell me how paranoid I am?
Asami says:  No. I just wanted to come by to make sure you're okay. You seemed so agitated earlier.
Mako says: I'm fine.
Asami says: Maybe you need a night off. Why don't we go get some dinner?
Mako says: No, thanks. I'm a little busy.
Asami says: Too busy for Kwong's Cuisine?  Remember? We had our first date there.
Mako says: Maybe I do need to get my mind off things. 
Lu says:  Police!  Hey, Mako.  Hope we didn't interrupt you two lovebirds.
Mako says: What's going on?
Lu says: We busted some Triple Threats who said you hired them for a job. 
Mako says: All right.  It's true. We were trying to figure out who stole Asami's stuff, so we hired them for a sting operation. I'm sorry for going behind your back. 
Lin says: According to the Triple Threats, you did more than that. They said you helped them steal a warehouse full of Future Industries property.
Asami says:  That's crazy! 
Mako says:  You're gonna believe a bunch of criminals?
Lin says: I have to follow up on a lead. 
Lu says:  Well, looky what I found: cash ...  And these.
Lin says: What are you doing with explosives, Mako?
Mako says: I don't know where those came from.
Gang says:  You're under arrest.
Mako says:  None of that is mine.
Gang says:  Yeah. Should've known you'd hook up with your old pals. Once a Triple Threat, always a Triple Threat.
Asami says: This has to be a mistake.
Lu says: Sorry to break the news to you, sweetie, but your boyfriend's just a crooked cop. That sting operation was just a way to lure you away from your warehouse.
Gang says:  He was using you the whole time. 
Mako says: That's not true, Asami. I would never do anything to hurt you.  It's Varrick. This is all Varrick. He set me up!
Gang says: Yeah, it's Varrick's fault. Varrick.  Varrick.

Bumi says:  You in the Spirit World yet?
Tenzin says: No, I am not,  and stop bugging me.

Tenzin says:  No! Just give me some time.
Kya says:  Stop being so stubborn. It's not your destiny. I think Jinora was meant to guide the Avatar.
Tenzin says:  Jinora will not enter the Spirit World! She's not ready for the dangers of the other side, but I am. I've spent years training, studying, and mastering everything there is to know about the Spirit World.
Korra says: Tenzin, we're running out of time.
Tenzin says: If everyone could just be quiet and let me  focus. 
Jinora says: Aunt Kya is right. I can guide Korra into the Spirit World. I'll be all right.
Tenzin says:  Perhaps I will never have the connections with spirits like I always wanted ... like my father wanted me to have.
Jinora says:  It's okay, Daddy.
Tenzin says: I'm proud of you.  Go. Close the portal. We'll wait here and keep your bodies safe till you return.

Reporters says: Avatar Korra, few questions please.
Male reporter #2 says: Avatar Korra, do you regret the way you handled the Unalaq Crisis?
Female reporter #1 says: Why are you forcing the integration of spirits in Republic City?
Korra says: Listen, I've been trying everything I can think of to get rid of these vines, but-
Male reporter #3 says: Why can't you fix this?
Male reporter #4 says: Are the vines here to stay?
Female reporter #2 says: Is this part of your New World Order?

Raiko says: The Avatar has put us all in a very difficult position, but my administration-
Korra says:  Oh, I'm sorry. Did I put you in a difficult position by fighting the giant force of pure evil that was going to destroy the whole world?  Maybe your administration could have handled that.
Lin says:  That's all, no more questions.
Korra says: This is a disaster.
Asami says:  Don't worry, we'll figure something out.

Tenzin says:  Hilarious.  Time for dinner, everyone.
Bumi says: No, check this out.  I can airbend.  Yeah wait, seriously, I was doing it.  No hold on, I just uh, maybe if I-  No.  I swear, I'm not making it up. 
Tenzin says:  Stop waving your arms around at the table. It's not funny anymore.
Bumi says:  It's not a joke.
Korra says: What's up with him?
Bolin says: Bumi says he airbended earlier, but he can't now. Oh, and I guess he's not very good at knitting either.  I gotta say, I love being a part of this family.  You got the grumpy dad,  the wacky uncle,  the put-upon mom,  crazy kids. Well, that's just great.
Asami says: Where's Mako?
Bolin says: Oh, you mean the brooding teenager? He's staying in the police station.
Korra says: Still?
Bolin says: I told him Tenzin invited us to stay here since our apartment is a vine habitat now, but,  he said he had to focus on work. 
Bumi says: Oh, did you see that? I think the napkin moved.
Kya says:  You blew on it.
Bumi says: Wait!  Maybe I can only do it when my life is in danger. Bolin, bend a giant boulder at me.
Bolin says: Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.

Shopkeeper says: We were arguing about the books, and Daw was yelling at me. And all of a sudden, things started flying around. He was creating this storm, like-
Mako says: Like what?
Shopkeeper says: Well, like he was airbending.
Mako says: Sir, that's impossible. There are only five airbenders in the entire world, and, your brother is not one of them.
Shopkeeper says: I know what I saw. He was freaking out yelling: "What's happening to me?!" Then, he ran into the back room and locked himself in.
Mako says:  Police. Open up.
Daw says:  Go away!

Korra says:  Do you think being in the Spirit World during Harmonic Convergence could have given him bending?
Tenzin says: I suppose it's possible.

Kya says:  I have been noticing a change in your aura lately.
Bumi says: And you didn't tell me?

Tenzin says: Lin, you won't believe this. Bumi just started airbending. 
Lin says: I'm afraid he's not the only one.
Tenzin and Korra says: What?
Mako says: I got a call last night. About a guy who just started airbending out of nowhere.
Tenzin says: You mean there's another one? Where is he now?
Mako says: He ... blew a door down on me and got away. We got an all-points bulletin out on him right now.
Korra says:  Wait, we'll help you look for him. Where should we start?
Mako says:  Oh, well, y'know, you should leave it with the police. It's ... police business. Y'know. It's um ... official.
Korra says: Okay.  How are you doing? You know, you're welcome to stay here instead of sleeping at the police station.
Mako says: No, I'm fine. I should just, get going. So, as you were  ladies. 
Korra says:  This is so exciting! New airbenders in the city. I bet we can find that guy before Mako does.  You know I'm not very good at this.
Asami says:  You're the Avatar, master of all the elements. You should know how to drive.  Besides, it's relaxing.  Clutch! Clutch!  That's the brake. Let's try again. You ready?
Korra says:  How long do you think talking to Mako is gonna be like pulling teeth?
Asami says:  Well, Mako has never been the most ... "in touch with his feelings" guy,  but it'll get better eventually.
Korra says: So, when I was gone, did he tell you that we broke up?
Asami says: Yeah ... we all knew. Sorry.
Korra says:  That's pretty embarrassing.
Asami says: Actually, I need to tell you something about that,  and I should have told you this sooner, but ... while you were gone ... I ... kind of ... kissed him. I'm sorry.
Korra says:  No wonder he's so nervous around us!
Asami says: You're not mad?
Korra says: No! I mean, I kissed Mako when he was going out with you, so ...
Asami says:  You what?
Korra says:  I'm so sorry! I thought you knew!
Asami says:  I'm just kidding. I knew a long time ago.
Korra says:  Well, whatever happened with Mako, I'm glad it hasn't come between us. I've never had a girlfriend to hang out with and talk to before, except for Naga. This is nice.
Asami says: Vine! Vine!
Fruithog Spirit says: Hey! Watch where you're going!
Korra says: What are you doing living in the middle of the road in the first place?!
Fruithog Spirit says: Don't ask me, Avatar! You made the world this way; we're just living in it!
Korra says: Look, I don't have anything against spirits, but these vines are causing major problems all over the city!
Fruithog Spirit says: Spirits, vines. We're all the same. Seems like the Avatar would know that. 
Asami says:  Korra, you okay?
Korra says:  I think that spirit just gave me an idea how to get rid of these vines ...  But I'm gonna need a lot of water.

Tenzin says: It's like a dream, Dad. After a hundred and seventy years, new airbenders.
Ikki says: Dad.  When that new guy's airbending, does that make him our brother?
Tenzin says: Well, in a way, all airbenders are our family.
Ikki says: Does that mean I have to share my room? Because I like my personal space.
Tenzin says: Of course not. But we might have to get used to not being the only airbenders around anymore.
Meelo says: I hope we have enough for an army.  I want to be Commander like Uncle Bumi.
Jinora says: Air Nomads don't have armies, Meelo.
Tenzin says: But maybe, there will be enough to fill the temples again. 
Jinora says: What's wrong, Daddy?
Tenzin says: I just wish your grandfather was here to see this.
Meelo says: Will you be airbender President?
Tenzin says: No, but I think the new airbenders will need lots of help and guidance to understand what it means to be part of our nation. That's a big responsibility.
Meelo says:  Don't worry dad, we'll help you. 
Tenzin says: I know you will.

Raiko says: I was alerted that you had a new plan to wipe out these noxious weed. So I thought you'd want everyone to be here to watch.
Male reporter #5 says: Avatar Korra,  do you really think-
Korra says:  No questions! Just stand there. Silently!
Korra says: Go in peace. 
Male reporter #6 says: How did you know what to do?
Male reporter #7 says: Will you send the spirits away now? 
Female reporter #3 says: How soon can we expect public water service to resume?
Korra says:  Look out! 
Korra says: Let's go, people! Hurry.
Korra says:  Hang on.

Korra says: Can't talk. Meditating.
Tenzin says: You must be at the end of your rope. You hate meditating.
Korra says: I thought if I really tried I might be able to contact my past Avatars, someone who knows something to help me, but I can't. They're gone and I'm all alone.  Did I ruin everything by leaving the spirit portals open?
Tenzin says: You didn't ruin anything. You did what you thought was best for the world, and now things have changed.  Change can be good or bad, depending on your point of view.
Korra says:  I know the people's point of view. It's bad.
Tenzin says: You're not the President, Korra. Your job isn't to fix the daily problems of every person in Republic City. Your responsibility is to bring balance to the entire world, and that means no matter what you do, some people are not going to be happy about it.
Korra says: Right. 
Tenzin says: On the other hand, some people will be very happy.  Like me. What you did during Harmonic Convergence may have brought back the Air Nation, and that can only be good for restoring balance. That is the act of a great Avatar.
Korra says: It's scary. I have all this power and all these people depending on me, but I don't know what I am supposed to be doing half the time. It seems like I should be ... wiser.
Tenzin says: True wisdom begins when we accept things as they are. You've started a new age, Korra. There's no going back to the past. 
Bolin says: Mako called!  The cops found a new airbender guy, but when they tried to bring him in, he ran away and climbed to the top of Kyoshi Bridge and won't come down. Ooh sorry, did I interrupt an Avatar wisdom session?
Korra says:  Avatar wisdom is the thing of the past, Bolin.  Come on.
Bolin says: Oh okay. Is that a good thing?
Korra says: Depends who you ask.

Daw says:  Stay back! I'm dangerous.
Daw says:  Sorry!
Korra says: Don't panic, I'm just here to talk.
Daw says: Please, I don't know what I'm doing and I don't want to hurt anyone.
Korra says: Tell me about it. Rough day, huh? I'm having kind of a rough day myself. You mind if I sit down here?
Daw says:  Huh.
Korra says: Look, I know you're scared. You've gone through a big change and its kind of my fault. But you're not alone, there are other airbenders and they want to help you. Actually, they are really excited to meet you.
Daw says: I don't want to be an airbender. Please, you're the Avatar, make it stop. Ahh! 
Korra says: I'm sorry, I can't, but I promise you things will get better if you just give it a chance. Let me take you over to Air Temple Island and we can talk this through. Okay? 
Daw says: Oh! Ahh!
Korra says: Daw, this is Tenzin. He is going to help you.
Tenzin says:  It is absolutely my pleasure to meet you, Daw. I have never met a new airbender before. Well, at least not one whose diaper I didn't have to change.
Daw says: Actually, I just fell off a bridge so I could use a fresh diaper right about now. 
Raiko says: So, is this the deal?  We have crisis every other day now thanks to you.
Korra says: Listen, I know you're having a tough time getting used to these changes and I'm sorry for that, but you and everyone else are going to have to learn live with it. The vines and the spirits are here to stay.
Raiko says: Well, you know who's not here to stay?  You! I order you to leave this city. You've caused nothing but trouble since you arrived. 
Korra says: Don't worry, I was already leaving.
Korra says: I can see my path now. There are new airbenders out there and I'm going to find them and rebuild the Air Nation.
Tenzin says: Don't think I'm not going with you. It's so exciting. Who knows who's out there now, discovering the gift of airbending for the first time?

White Lotus sentry says: You know the drill, Zaheer.
Zaheer says: Of course. 
White Lotus sentry says: Hope you still like rice.
Zaheer says: Have you ever read the poetry of the great airbending guru, Laghima?
White Lotus sentry says: What?
Zaheer says: Guru Laghima lived four thousand years ago in the Northern Air Temple. It is said that he unlocked the secret of weightlessness and became untethered from the earth, living his final forty years without ever touching the ground.
White Lotus sentry says:  Is that how you plan to escape? With something you picked up from an old airbender children's story?
Zaheer says: Like all great children's tales, it contains truth within the myth. Laghima once wrote: "Instinct is a lie, told by a fearful body, hoping to be wrong."
White Lotus sentry says: What's that supposed to mean?
Zaheer says: It means that when you base your expectations only on what you see,  you blind yourself to the possibilities of a new reality.
Zaheer says: Uh, uh, uh. You wouldn't want to singe your friend, would you?
White Lotus sentry says:  How? You're not a ... bender.
Zaheer says: Nature is constantly changing. Like the wind.
Zaheer says: Now you might want to ration that bowl of rice. You've got three weeks until the next shift change. It's the dawning of a new age. The end of the White Lotus, and soon, the end of the Avatar.

Shiro Shinobi says:  It's brother versus brother in the war of the Water Tribes. After Korra discovered that Chief Unalaq betrayed her and her father, she turned against him, sparking civil war. The Southern rebels rallied around Tonraq, but they are vastly outnumbered, so Korra is headed to Republic City to seek aid. But will she be able to convince President Raiko to send troops to help the South?
</scene>

<scene>
Lin says: Welcome home, Avatar.  Thanks for starting a war.
Korra says:  I didn't start a war. Well, I did, but it's more complicated than you're making it seem.
Lin says: Mako, I want you back on the beat. There's going to be a Southern Water Tribe peace march tonight. I need you there to make sure things don't get out of hand.
Mako says: I'm all yours.
Korra says: I'll go too. The people of the South need to see that the Avatar is on their side in the fight against the Northern invaders.
Lin says:  Great, that should calm them down. 
Mako says: Maybe you should sit this out.
Korra says: What?
Mako says: I just think having you there blatantly supporting one side will only make things worse. You could at least try to seem neutral.
Korra says: I'm not neutral! The North invaded my home. The only reason I'm here is to get the Republic to send troops to help the South.
Varrick says: Zhu Li's already scheduled a meeting for us with President Raiko tomorrow. We'll get them on board.
Mako says: Whatever, I gotta go to work. 
Asami says: I better go check on my factory. 
Korra says: I'm going to find out about this peace march. 
Varrick says: And I am dying for a pedicure. 
Bolin says: So, um, what should I be doing?
Mako says: I don't know, Bolin. Figure something out.
Varrick says:  Say, kid, have you ever seen Republic City at night? 
Bolin says: Sure, I live here.
Varrick says: Have you really seen it?
Bolin says: Y- no?
Varrick says:  That's what I thought. Come on.

General says:  Tonraq and the rebels are holed up here in the hills outside of town.
Unalaq says: Leave them. My brother's no threat to us up there. Increase security around the spirit portal. Keeping it safe is our number one priority.
General says: Yes, sir!
Unalaq says: I need you two to go after the Avatar. She's the only one who can open the Northern spirit portal.
Desna says: But Father, you told Korra-
Unalaq says: I told Korra what I thought she needed to hear.
Eska says: I'll find her.  She stole my husband.
Unalaq says: I need her alive.
Eska says:  Fine.

Meelo says: Poki, where are you going?
Tenzin says: Command respect.  Having some trouble, son?

Reporter says: Tensions are running up high outside of the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center. The Avatar is leading a group of Southerners in a peaceful protest against Chief Unalaq, but the Northerners have come out in droves in support of their leader.

Spectator says: Look! It's Bolin!
Shiro Shinobi says: Folks, that cheer you're hearing is for local favorite, Bolin, of the Fire Ferrets. Let's see if we can get a quick interview. Bolin!  Bolin, the Fire Ferrets are out for the season. How have you been spending your time lately?
Bolin says: Well, I took a trip South for the Glacier Spirits Festival, was briefly engaged to a princess, then went through kind of a tough breakup there, was accidentally involved in a civil war ...  But there's nowhere I'd rather be than pro-bending night in Republic City! Am I right, people? Republic City! 
Shiro Shinobi says: Do you miss being in the ring?
Bolin says: Well, I definitely don't miss getting hit with things all the time, and the humiliating losing. I mean, that gets pretty old. You know, sometimes I actually cry myself to sleep ...  I guess what I miss the most are these fans! They're the greatest fans in the world! Give it up for the fans! 
Varrick says: Look how these people love you, kid! They're eating that cornball spiel right out of your hand.
Bolin says: The trick is, whenever I get confused, I just say "Republic City" or "fans", and then everyone cheers.
Varrick says: I think I just figured out your true calling.

Korra says: Hello, Mr. President.  Sir, the Southern Water Tribe-
Raiko says: Just a second. Keep smiling. 
Raiko says: Now, how can I help the Avatar and my most generous supporter?
Korra says: Unalaq's troops have invaded the South. We need you to send the United Forces to help.
Raiko says: I'm very concerned by what's happening down there. But I don't think it's the Republic's place to interfere with internal Water Tribe matters.
Korra says: Unalaq isn't even the rightful ruler of the Water Tribe. He lied his way onto the Northern throne.
Varrick says: Mr. President, the Republic is already involved in this conflict. The North attacked our cultural center last night.
Raiko says: Believe me, we are doing everything we can to bring the people responsible to justice.
Korra says: "The people responsible"? Who else would it be but the Northerners?
Raiko says: Now, I know that when you're young, it's hard to keep perspective-
Korra says:  You're the one who's lost perspective. I'm trying to save my tribe, and you're taking pictures.
Raiko says: Sending troops is not something I can do at this time. But I promise I will work with Unalaq and the South for a diplomatic solution. Now, I'm sorry, but my mind is made up. This meeting is over.
Korra says: My family is going to be wiped out, and it'll be on your head for doing nothing about it. 
</scene>

Korra says:  I can't believe the President is doing nothing! H-He doesn't even care!
Mako says: I'm sure he cares, but he can't just tell his people to go fight a battle at the South Pole that has nothing to do with them.
Korra says:  How could you take his side?
Mako says: What's with you and sides? Why do you always think I'm working against you?
Korra says: Well, you're not helping me! I'm trying to get troops to the South. What are you doing?
Mako says: I'm doing my job.
Korra says:  Well, excuse me, officer. Don't let me stand in the way of you writing tickets. I'm just trying to save the world.
Mako says: Well, you wouldn't have to if you didn't keep messing it up!
Korra says: I can't talk to you when you're like this. 
Mako says:  You're the one who's like this!

Asami says: Huh?  Hey! In a hurry?
Korra says: Sorry, I have to talk to Varrick.
Asami says: Yeah, me too.
Varrick says:  Oh, hello!  See? I told you I could do it.
Bolin says: Sorry I ever doubted you.
Korra says: We can't wait for the President to act. We need those troops now.
Asami says: And my company is about to go under. I have to find a way to make some sales.
Varrick says: Right, okay. Got it. Idea storm!  Get the supplies!  You're about to get an inside look at how Varrick Global Industries stays at the forefront of imagination innovation, or "imagivation"! That's trademarked, pal.  Brainwork requires increased circulation.  Let's do this!  Okay, here come the ideas. Fast and furious. Pink mint lemon tea. Radio for pets. Uh, hand shoes. Hold on a tic. We don't need the President to go to the South. We just need the troops! Let's go straight to them! If there's one thing I know about troops, it's that they love fighting.
Korra says: I know General Iroh. He might be willing to help us.
Varrick says: A man on the inside. Perfect!  And you need to sell some mecha tanks. I know some people who need them. We'll ship 'em South.
Korra says: That's perfect! You'll be making money for your company and you'll be helping to defeat Unalaq.
Varrick says: It's true. If you can't make money during a war, you just flat-out cannot make money.
Asami says: It's dangerous on the seas right now, but I'm willing to try if you are.
Varrick says: It'll be crazy risky, but I love crazy risky! End storm!  Zhu Li, get those other ideas to research and development. I want prototypes by next week. 
Korra says: I don't understand why it's so hard to get Republic City to support the South.
Varrick says: Don't worry, I'm already working on that. As soon as people see this, they'll be lining up to fight Unalaq. Zhu Li, do the, uh-- the thing.
Bolin says: Don't freak out. It's not real.
Varrick says: I had a film crew documenting the entire Northern invasion.
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says:  Ahhh! Sorry. I keep doing that.
Varrick says: We're gonna cut this footage together with scenes we shoot of our superstar Bolin here playing a Southern Water Tribe hero  battling the evil Unalaq. No one will root for the North after they see "The Adventures of Nuktuk: Hero of the South"!
Bolin says:  I'm Nuktuk! What do you think?
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: Oh, man, you should have seen Varrick today. That guy is a genius.
Mako says: Uh-huh.
Bolin says: He's gonna help Asami sell her mecha tanks to the South, and he came up with this great idea for Korra to get General Iroh to fight Unalaq without President Raiko ever even knowing.
Mako says: What? That's a terrible idea!
Bolin says: And he's gonna put me in the movers as this hero, Nuktuk!  He's a man of action, but he's got a heart of gold. He was born in the tundra.
Mako says: Look, I'm trying to do something that's actually important here.
Bolin says: Oh. Oh, sorry. Uh, sure. What is it?
Mako says: Something doesn't make sense about this bombing. I just don't buy that the Northern Water Tribe was behind it.  Wait a second! That's him! That's the guy that attacked the center! I gotta go show this to Beifong! 
Bolin says: Glad I could help. Nuktuk saves the day again!

Tenzin says: All right, Meelo, the first thing you need to do as a trainer is establish dominance. You are in charge. Never forget that. Now call Poki.

Tenzin says: Meelo ... you're rewarding him for bad behavior.
Meelo says: But he's tickling me.

Tenzin says: You can't let him nap in the bed with you. You are the alpha lemur. He has to sleep on the floor.  I know it's hard,  but it's for the best.

Raiko says: How did this Cultural Center attack happen right under your nose? And why haven't you arrested the Northerners responsible?
Lin says: We're working on it, sir.
Raiko says: Well, work harder! If you don't get any results soon, I'm going to find someone who can.
Mako says: I got a break in the bombing case. I I.D.'d the guy I saw at the scene.
Lu says: That's great, Mako.
Gang says: Yeah, you better run that in to Beifong right now.
Mako says: You think?
Lu says: Sure. You're gonna be a hero!
Lin says: What makes a rookie beat cop think he can interrupt my meeting with the President? 
Mako says: I'm sorry, I just-- um, I found something out about the bombing. 
Lin says: Well, give it to Lu and Gang, you moron.  Now get out! 
Lu says: Sorry. Was she busy?
Mako says: This is the guy I saw sneaking out of the building right before the explosions. He's a member of the Agni Kais. Someone must have hired him to make it look like Northerners attacked the Cultural Center. 
Gang says: Hmm. 
Mako says: Did you learn anything about that remote control I found at the scene? That's gotta be the key to finding out who's really responsible.
Lu says: Listen, kid, it was the Northern Water Tribe, okay?
Gang says: Yeah, give it a rest, Super Cop.
Raiko says: I've heard good things about you. You've made some big triad busts for a rookie.
Mako says: Thank you, sir.
Raiko says: And you're dating the Avatar, right?
Mako says: Yes, sir.
Raiko says: I'm concerned that she might be getting some bad advice from Varrick. You wouldn't happen to know if they're plotting anything that might compromise the security of Republic City, would you, officer?  Let me remind you that you've sworn an oath. You're a man of the law before anything else.
Mako says: Yes, sir.
Raiko says: Well, keep up the good work. 
Mako says:  Wait, there's something you should know.

Korra says: Thank you for seeing me, General Iroh.
Iroh says: What can I do?
Korra says: The South needs military support before Unalaq wipes them out completely, but the President is refusing to give the order. So I decided to come to you directly.
Iroh says: I see. Well, suppose I were to take the fleet South on some routine training maneuvers. And let's say we were to accidentally run into a hostile Northern blockade. We'd have no choice but to defend ourselves, wouldn't we?
Korra says: I guess you wouldn't. Thank you!
Raiko says:  Swapping old war stories?
Iroh says:  Mr. President.
Raiko says: I hope you're not planning to take any military action without an order from your commander-in-chief?
Iroh says: Of course not, sir.
Raiko says: Good. Because if a single vessel leaves this harbor without my say-so, you'll be court-martialed. Am I clear?
Iroh says: Crystal, sir.
Raiko says:  Your activities here are bordering on insurrection. The Avatar does not command the military of the Republic. Don't go behind my back again.  As you were, General Iroh. 
Korra says:  I hate that guy!
Iroh says:  I'm sorry. My hands are officially tied.
Korra says: I understand. Thanks anyway.
Iroh says:  But you should talk to the Fire Lord. My mother and grandfather have always been good friends with the Avatar, and the Southern Water Tribe. I'm sure they'll be willing to help.
Korra says: Thank you, General.

Korra says:  Bolin, I need you to watch Naga while I'm gone.
Bolin says: Where are you going?
Korra says: The Fire Nation. I'm going to try to get them to help the South.  I need a boat.
Varrick says: What happened with General Iroh?
Korra says: He was going to help, but then President Raiko showed up. Someone must have tipped him off, but I can't figure it out. No one knew about it except for us and Asami.
Bolin says: And Mako.
Korra says: Mako? 
Bolin says: What?  There's no way Mako would have told.  Right?

Korra says:  You betrayed me, and my family! 
Mako says:  Enough! Look, I have a job to do! I can't constantly be worrying about keeping you from making another huge mistake!
Korra says:  Well, I have a job to do too, only it seems like you're always standing in the way of me getting it done!
Mako says: Well, I guess if we're both putting our jobs first, maybe there's no room for our relationship! 
Korra says:  So, what? Are you breaking up with me?
Mako says:  Yeah. I guess I am.

Shiro Shinobi says:  Benders be on alert. After coming face to face with Amon, leader of the Equalists, Avatar Korra discovers a terrifying truth: this masked mad man has the ability to take away a person's bending, permanently. Benders of Republic City are counting on their young Avatar. But is she prepared to face such a frightening foe?
Amon says: After I take your bending away, you will be nothing. 
Korra says: It's ... it's all right, Naga. I just had a bad dream.

Tarrlok says: There is a madman running around our beloved city, threatening to tear it apart. We need to create a task force whose sole mission is to find Amon and bring him to justice.
Tenzin says:  Absolutely not. A move that aggressive would only further divide benders and nonbenders.
Fire Nation councilwoman says: Tarrlok, I'm inclined to agree with your proposal, but who would even  head up such a task force?
Tarrlok says:  It would be my honor and privilege to accept such a duty.
Tenzin says:  This is just another one of your ploys to gain more power, isn't it? 
Tarrlok says: All I'm trying to do is help. Think back, forty-two years ago, Republic City was threatened by another dangerous man. Yakone.  Your father wasn't afraid to deal with him head-on.
Tenzin says: This.. is a completely different situation ...  and how dare you compare yourself to Avatar Aang!
Tarrlok says:  Amon is not going to stop with the bending triads.  Eventually, he will come for all us benders. Our friends, our families. Vote for this task force and I will stop Amon before it's too late. All in favor?
</scene>

<scene>
Amon says: Good evening, my fellow Equalists.  This is your leader, Amon.  As you have heard, the Republic Council has voted to make me public enemy number one, proving once again that the bending  oppressors of this city will stop at nothing to quash our revolution. But we cannot be stopped. Our numbers grow stronger by the day. You no longer have to live in fear.  The time has come for benders to experience fear. 
Asami says: Oh, no!  I'm so sorry. I didn't see you.

Mako says: Don't worry, I'm fine. My brother hits me harder than that every day in practice. 
Asami says: Wait, I recognize you. You're Mako, right? You play for the Fire Ferrets.
Mako says: Yeah, that's me.
Asami says:  I am so embarrassed.  My name is Asami. Let me make this up to you somehow. Uh, how about I treat you to dinner? Tomorrow night, eight o' clock, Kwong's Cuisine.

Tarrlok says: Good, because I am absolutely famished.  Airbenders never turn away a hungry guest, am I right?
Tenzin says:  I suppose. 
Tarrlok says:  Ah, you must be the famous Avatar Korra. It is truly an honor.  I am Councilman Tarrlok, representative from the Northern Water Tribe.
Korra says:  Nice to meet you. 
Ikki says:  Why do you have three ponytails?  And how come you smell like a lady? You're weird.
Tarrlok says: Well aren't you ... precocious?  So, I've been reading all about your adventures in the papers. Infiltrating Amon's rally, now that took some real initiative.
Korra says: Oh, thanks. I think you're the first authority figure in the city who's happy I'm here.
Tarrlok says: Republic City is much better off now that you've arrived.
Tenzin says:  Enough with the flattery, Tarrlok. What do you want from Korra?
Tarrlok says:  Patience, Tenzin. I'm getting to that.  As you may have heard, I am assembling a task force that will strike at the heart of the revolution and I want you to join me.
Korra says:  Really?
Tenzin says:  What?!
Tarrlok says: I need someone who will help me attack Amon directly, someone who is fearless in the face of danger.  And that someone is you.
Korra says: Join your task force? I can't. 
Tarrlok says:  I must admit, I'm rather surprised. I thought you'd jump at the chance to help me lead the charge against Amon.
Tenzin says:  Me, too.
Korra says: I came to Republic City to finish my Avatar training with Tenzin. Right now, I just need to focus on that.
Tarrlok says: Which is why this opportunity is perfect. You would get on the job experience while performing your Avatar duty for the city.
Tenzin says:  Korra gave you her answer. It's time for you to go.
Tarrlok says: Very well.  But,  I'm not giving up on you just yet.  You'll be hearing from me soon.  It has been a pleasure, Avatar Korra. 
Ikki says:  Bye-bye, ponytail man!
Server says: Ah, welcome to Kwong's Cuisine, Master Mako. 
Mako says: Uh, "Master"?
Mako says: The scarf stays.
Server says: As you wish, sir.  This way please. 
Asami says:  I am such a big pro-bending fan. I caught all of your matches this season.
Mako says: All of them? Wow. Honestly, I wish there were a few you hadn't seen.
Asami says: Oh, don't be ridiculous, you're amazing. I can't wait to see you play in the tournament.
Mako says: Yeah, well, ah, maybe next year.
Asami says: What do you mean? You made it in.
Mako says: It just isn't in the cards for us right now.
Asami says:  Tell me.  What's the problem?
Mako says: We don't have the cash to ante up for the championship pot. So, it looks like we're out of the running.
Asami says: That's not fair.
Server says:  Pardon me, Ms. Sato.  Your main course.
Mako says: Ms. Sato? You wouldn't happen to be related to Hiroshi Sato, creator of the Satomobile?
Asami says: Yeah. He's my dad.
Mako says:  Get out of town!
Asami says: I'm serious.  You want to meet him?
Mako says: Meet the most successful captain of industry in all of Republic City? Yeah, I'll take you up on that.
Bolin says:  Hello, fellow teammate!
Korra says: Hey, Bolin. 
Bolin says: Missed you at practice this week.
Korra says: Yeah, sorry about that.
Bolin says: Nah, that's all right. We're probably out of the tournament anyways unless some money miraculously drops out of the sky by tomorrow. Anyways, the reason I came by was to give you this.  Ta-da!
Korra says: Wow, thanks.  What's this for?
Bolin says:  Uh, oh I can't remember now. Oh yeah, now I remember. You saved me from Amon!
Korra says: Oh, that?  It was no big deal.
Bolin says: No big deal, are you serious? I was totally freaking out when he was coming at me with his creepy mask all, "I will take away your bending forever."  I mean that is.. scary stuff; I still can't sleep well.
Korra says: Mhmm.
Council page says: Delivery for Avatar Korra.  Tarrlok sends his compliments and urges you to reconsider his offer.
Korra says: Tell him I haven't changed my mind.
Council page says: Mhmm ... 
Bolin says: Who's this Tarrlok guy? Is he bothering you? Huh, 'cause I could have a word with him. 
Korra says:  Heh, no it's not like that. He's just some old guy who works with Tenzin on the council.
Bolin says: Oh, good. Good, that sounds better. I like that better.

Hiroshi Sato says: What do you think of my little operation here?
Mako says: It's very impressive, Mr. Sato.
Hiroshi Sato says: Please, call me Hiroshi. So, I understand you're dirt poor.
Mako says: Uh, well ...
Hiroshi Sato says: Young man, it is nothing to be ashamed of. I too came from humble beginnings. Why, when I was your age, I was a mere shoe-shiner, and all I had to my name was an idea; the Satomobile.  Now, I was fortunate enough to meet someone who believed in me and my work ethic. He gave me the money I needed to get my idea off the ground and I built the entire Future Industries empire from that one selfless loan. 
Asami says: Dad, stop bragging. Just tell Mako the good news. 
Mako says: What good news?
Hiroshi Sato says: Well, my daughter passionately told me all about your hard earned success in the Pro-bending Arena. And about your team's current  financial stumbling block. Now, I'd hate to see you lose your chance at winning the championship just because you're short a few yuans. That's why I'm going to sponsor the Fire Ferrets in the tournament.
Mako says: Are you serious?
Asami says: He's serious. My dad's going to cover your ante for the championship pot.
Mako says: Tha-that is good news.
Hiroshi Sato says: There's just one catch. You all have to wear the Future Industries logo on your uniforms.
Mako says: I'll tattoo it on my chest if you want, sir.  Thank you both so much.  I promise the Fire Ferrets will make the most of this opportunity.
Ikki says:  Out of the way Daddy, we're driving here!  Beeeeeeep beebeebeeeeep!
Meelo says: Beep-beep.
Tenzin says: I see Tarrlok's gifts are getting more and more extravagant.
Korra says:  Yeah, that guy doesn't know how to take "no" for an answer.
Tenzin says: Korra, are you ... doing all right?
Korra says: Yeah, I'm fine. 
Tenzin says:  Why don't you take a break?  I'm glad you turned down Tarrlok, but I just want to make sure your decision was for the right reason.
Korra says: I'm just really focused on my airbending right now is all.
Tenzin says:  Right, that's what you said. You know, it's okay to be scared. The whole city is frightened by what's been going on. The important thing is to talk about our fears, because if we don't, they can throw us out of balance.
Tenzin says: I'm always here for you, if you want to talk.
</scene>

<scene>
Council page says: Avatar Korra! I have something for you.
Korra says: It doesn't matter how many gifts Tarrlok sends, I am no​t joining his task force.
Council page says: It's not a gift, it's an invitation.
Korra says:  To what? 
Council page says: Tarrlok is throwing a gala in your honor.  All of Republic City's movers and shakers will be there. The councilman humbly requests your attendance.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: I can't believe this is all for me.
Tenzin says: I'm not sure what Tarrlok's plotting, but keep your guard up. It's not like him to throw a party just for the fun of it.
Tarrlok says:  So glad you could make it, Avatar Korra.  If you'd excuse us, the city awaits its hero. 
Tenzin says: Meelo! No, that's not a toilet! Oh dear. 
Tarrlok says: Korra, it's my pleasure to introduce Republic City's most famous industrialist, Hiroshi Sato.
Korra says: Nice to meet you.
Hiroshi Sato says:  We're all expecting great things from you.
Korra says: Right,  greatness.
Mako says:  Hey, Korra!
Hiroshi Sato says:  This is my daughter, Asami.
Asami says: It's lovely to meet you. Mako's told me so much about you.
Korra says:  Really? Because he hasn't mentioned you at all. How did you two meet?
Bolin says:  Asami crashed into him on her moped.
Korra says:  What? Are you okay?
Mako says: I'm fine. More than fine. Mister Sato agreed to sponsor our team; we're back in the tournament!
Bolin says:  Hehe, isn't that great?
Korra says:  Yeah, terrific.
Tarrlok says:  Chief Beifong, I believe you and Avatar Korra have already met.
Lin Beifong says:  Just because the city's throwing you this big to-do,  don't think you're something special.  You've done absolutely nothing to deserve this. 
Tarrlok says: If you'd be so kind, they just have a couple of questions.
Korra says: But ...
Reporter #1 says: Avatar Korra, you witnessed Amon take away people's bending firsthand. How serious a threat does he pose to the innocent citizens of Republic City?
Korra says:  I think he presents a real problem. 
Reporter #2 says: Then why have you refused to join Tarrlok's task force? As the Avatar, shouldn't you be going after Amon?
Korra says: Well, I ...
Reporter #2 says: Why are you backing away from this fight?
Korra says:  What? No! I've never backed away from anything in my life!
Reporter #3 says: You promised to serve this city, aren't you going back on that promise now?
Reporter #4 says: Do you think pro-bending is more important than fighting the revolution?
Reporter #5 says: How do you think Avatar Aang would have handled this?
Reporter #2 says:  Are you afraid of Amon?
Korra says:  I am not afraid of anybody! If the city needs me then ...  I'll join Tarrlok's task force and help fight Amon.
Tarrlok says:  There's your headline, folks.
</scene>

<scene>
Tarrlok says: My fellow task force deputies, tonight we will execute a raid on an underground chi blocker training camp located in the Dragon Flats borough. According to my sources, there is a cellar underneath this bookstore,  where Equalists train chi blocking in secret.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: I'm going after those two.
Korra says: Nice timing. Thanks, Tarrlok.
Tarrlok says: We make a good team, Avatar.
Korra says: Yeah, we do. 
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: No Korra for practice again?
Mako says:  Doesn't look like it.
</scene>

<scene>
Tarrlok says: Avatar Korra has bravely answered the call to action. With the two of us leading the charge, Republic City has nothing to fear from Amon and the Equalists.
Female reporter says: Question for the Avatar!  Amon remains at large. Why have you failed to locate him?
Korra says:  You want to know why? Because Amon is hiding in the shadows like a coward.  Amon, I challenge you to a duel! No task force, no chi blockers, just the two of us tonight at midnight on Avatar Aang Memorial Island. Let's cut to the chase and settle this thing, if you're man enough to face me. 
</scene>

<scene>
Asami says: I know it sounds weird to say this, but I'm really glad I hit you with my moped.
Mako says:  Uh, me too.
Asami says: I forgot to ask. Why didn't you accept the new silk scarf I bought for you last week? You didn't like it?
Mako says: No, it was really nice, but this scarf was my father's. And it's all I have left of him. I just feel like ...  Like it keeps me safe.
Asami says: I'm so sorry. I lost my mother when I was very young. 
Asami says: I feel so safe with you. 
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says: Korra, this is madness.
Korra says:  Don't try to stop me and don't follow me. I have to face Amon alone.
Tenzin says:  This is all your doing!
Tarrlok says: I tried to talk her out of it too, but she's made up her mind.
Tarrlok says: We'll be watching the island closely. If anything goes wrong, I have a fleet of police airships ready to swoop down.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  Guess you're a no-show, Amon. Who's scared now? 
</scene>

<scene>
Amon says: I received your invitation, young Avatar.
Amon says: Our showdown, while inevitable, is premature. Although it would be the simplest thing for me to take away your bending right now, I won't. You'd only become a martyr.  Benders of every nation would rally behind your untimely demise,  but I assure you, I have a plan. And I'm saving you for last, then you'll get your duel, and I will destroy you.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  Aang?
Tenzin says:  Korra!  Korra, are you all right? What happened? Was Amon here?
Korra says: Yeah, he ambushed me.
Tenzin says:  Did he ... did he take your bending away?
Korra says:  No, I'm okay.
Tenzin says:  Ah, thank goodness.
Korra says:  I was so terrified, I felt so helpless.
Tenzin says:  It's all right, the nightmare is over.
Korra says:  You ... you were right ... I've been scared this whole time.  I've never felt like this before and ... and Tenzin, I don't know what to do! 
Tenzin says:  Admitting your fears is the first and most difficult step in overcoming them.

Shiro Shinobi says:  The Southern Water Tribe is under siege! When Avatar Korra was attacked by a dark spirit, Chief Unalaq was the only one able to stop it. So, Korra turned her back on Tenzin and chose Unalaq as her new spiritual mentor. Tenzin and his family left for a vacation at the Southern Air Temple, while Korra remained in the Water Tribe. Will she be able to restore balance between humans and spirits?
</scene>

Unalaq says: You're early.
Korra says: What can I say? I'm pumped up to learn that Unalaq spirit fighting.
Unalaq says:  I'm not here to teach you to fight spirits, I'm here to help you begin your spiritual training. We're going to one of the most remote places in the world, the long neglected spiritual center of your tribe, the South Pole.
Korra says: You're going to train me at the South Pole?
Unalaq says: We will do more than just train. By neglecting the spirits, the people of the South have brought darkness upon themselves, and now it threatens to destroy our tribe. We must set things right. The Southern Water Tribe depends on you.
Korra says:  A dangerous trip to the South Pole? Count me in!

Tenzin says: No thank you, I'm fine.
Shung says: And you must be the honorable Pema! Please, accept these gifts.  This is an ancient airbender head shaver we've refurbished just for you.
Tenzin says: Oh.  Okay?
Shung says: And Pema!  These flowers once filled the mountainside! Now, they can brighten up your room.
Pema says:  That's ... sweet? Y-you didn't have to.
Shung says: Nonsense! Whatever you need is yours. Anything for the mother of the next generation of airbenders.
Ikki says:  No!  That gift is mine!
Jinora says: You don't even like to read!

Korra says:  Thanks, Captain Expedition, but I'll be fine.
Unalaq says: Tonraq, what do you want?
Tonraq says: I heard you're taking Korra to the South Pole.  I'm coming.
Unalaq says:  Absolutely not. You're a distraction to Korra and a hindrance to what needs to be done.
Tonraq says: My daughter is not going without me! She needs someone to watch after her.
Korra says:  Dad, why do you always think you know what's best for me?
Unalaq says: Because he's misguided. The sad truth is, it's men like your father who have put the Spirit World out of balance. He's ignored my warnings in the past and hasn't learned since.
Korra says: What happened in the past?
Tonraq says: It doesn't matter. What matters is the Everstorm.
Mako says: The Everstorm?
Tonraq says: It's a massive blizzard that's battered the South Pole for decades.  I'm coming, unless you think you can stop me.

Bolin says: Varrick; he's awesome! He also gave me this fancy snowsuit! It's inflatable, with an internal heater, emergency beacon, and food ration pouches! I mean, if I get lost, I can survive in this thing for like, like a month!  Who wants some freeze dried cucumberquats.  Nobody? ... Did I interrupt a conversation? 
Korra says:  No, the conversation is over.  Dad, come if you want, just don't interfere with my training. .

Bolin says:  Sure does. But, uh ... who's gonna drive?

Mako says:  Well, what do you know? Looks like--
Bolin says:  Go away, Mako.
Korra says:  So once we get to the South Pole, then what happens?
Unalaq says: You will open an ancient spirit portal.
Korra says: I'm sorry, what now?
Unalaq says: At the South Pole, there is a portal that connects our world to the Spirit World, but it has long been closed.
Korra says: And that's why the evil spirits are attacking?
Unalaq says: There are no evil spirits, there is light and dark in them all. But when they're unbalanced, the darkness takes over.  If you can open the portal in time, balance will be restored.
Korra says: What do you mean ... in time?
Unalaq says: There's a reason the Glacier Spirits Festival ends on the winter solstice. That's when the Spirit World and the physical world are close together. Only then can the Avatar open the portal.
Korra says: The winter solstice is tomorrow.
Unalaq says: Exactly, and we can't afford to wait another year.
Korra says: Easy, Naga.
Bolin says:  What are those?
Korra says: Dark spirits.
Tonraq says: Let's keep moving. We have to find a safe place to set up camp.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Uncle, why do you think the dark spirits are following us?
Bolin says: Can we not talk about dark spirits, please? 
Mako says: My brother doesn't like ghost stories.
Eska says:  Don't worry. I will protect you, my feeble turtle duck.
Bolin says: Thank you.
Unalaq says: Sadly, this isn't a ghost story. This is real.  The spirits are angry because he's here.  Haven't you ever wondered how your father ended up in the South Pole? Why he's never taken you to visit his homeland in the North?
Tonraq says: Unalaq, this is not the time.
Unalaq says: You're right. You should have told her a long time ago.
Korra says: Told me what!?
Tonraq says:  I left the North Pole because ... I was banished.
Korra says: You were banished from the North? Why?
Tonraq says: Because I almost destroyed the entire tribe.  Twenty years ago, I was a general in the Northern Water Tribe, sworn to protect my people.
Young Unalaq says:  Brother! We're being attacked!
</scene>

<scene>
Tonraq says:  I drove them out of the city and deep into the frozen tundra.
</scene>

<scene>
Tonraq says:  We tracked them deep into an ancient forest. Many believed this forest was the home to spirits, and the barbarians retreated there because they thought we wouldn't attack them on such hallow grounds. They thought wrong.
Tonraq says:  We captured the barbarians, but in the process, we destroyed the forest.  I didn't realize the consequences of what I had done.  By destroying the forest, I unknowingly let loose angry spirits.
Tonraq says:  They threatened to destroy everything, the entire city.
</scene>

<scene>
Tonraq says:  Unalaq was able to guide the spirits back to the forest. But by then, the damage had been done.  For being the cause of so much devastation, my father banished me from the Northern Water Tribe in shame.
</scene>

<scene>
Tonraq says:  That's when I came to the South and started a new life.
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: Whoa, so you  were supposed to be chief, then he  became chief. No wonder you guys don't like each other.  Ow! What? Isn't that what happened?
Korra says:  I can't believe you kept this from me.
Tonraq says: I was protecting you from the shame I brought on the family.
Korra says: Why did you keep hiding things from me and then telling me it's for my own protection? I'm tired of you protecting me! 
Tonraq says: Korra!
</scene>

Jinora says: Wow, the statue room.
Tenzin says: That's right, Jinora, the most sacred place in the entire Southern Air Temple.  Here, you will find statues of every Avatar who ever lived.  Where are your brother and sister?
Meelo says: You can't catch me! I've the greatest air scooter-er of all time! 
Tenzin says:  Meelo!
</scene>

<scene>
Tonraq says: Korra, you have every right to be mad at me. But I don't want you to make the same mistake I made. I should never have gone into that forest, and we shouldn't be going to the South Pole now. Spirits and the physical world should remain separate.
Korra says:  Dad, it's my job to be the bridge between the spirits and the physical world, and I finally have a chance to live up to my potential.
Tonraq says:  You don't even know if what Unalaq says is true.
Unalaq says:  You want proof? Look to the sky. Where I'm from, the spirits are at peace and they light up the dark.
Korra says: The Northern Lights.
Unalaq says: Yes. There used to be lights at the South as well, but during the Hundred Year War, the South was thrown out of balance and the lights disappeared. When the War ended, the North helped to rebuild you physically, as a nation, but we have not rebuilt you spiritually. Now the spirits no longer dance in your skies. Instead, they rampage in the Everstorm.
Mako says:  I think we're here.
</scene>

Bolin says:  Is that what I think it is?

Mako says: Nothing, he was just worried about you, that's all.
Korra says:  Y'know, sometimes I wonder whose side you're on.
Mako says: There aren't any sides. We all just want to help however we can. You have to trust that we're here for you.
Unalaq says: We've arrived.
</scene>

Korra says: Trees frozen in the ice.
Unalaq says:  It's just like the sacred forest Tonraq destroyed in the North.
Korra says: So, what do I do?
Unalaq says: You must find your way to the heart of the forest where the dormant spirit portal lies. From here, you're on your own.
Mako says: Wait a second, there's no way she's going alone.
Bolin says: Yeah! If she goes,  we go, too!
Unalaq says: The Avatar must go alone.
Korra says: But I don't have any connection with the spirits. In fact, it seems like they hate me.
Unalaq says: You have to believe in yourself, like I believe in you.  What is it?
Korra says: I guess I'm just so used to people telling me how to do things that I forgot what it was like to have someone trust in me. 
Unalaq says: Korra, all the past Avatars live on inside of you. Let them guide you. Let them help you find the light in the dark. 
Korra says:  Wait here, I'll be okay.

Mako says:  You never cease to amaze me.
Korra says: Thanks. By the way, I'm really sorry for being a total pain. Things were really stressful and pretty confusing. It's hard being the Avatar.
Mako says:  It's harder being the Avatar's boyfriend.

Wei says:  I can't believe I'm stuck with her friend.

Bolin says: Hang on, I think I got it. Let me just try this.  Nope, okay maybe- 
Wei says: Trial by fire. It's the best way to learn metalbending.  Agh!
Mako says:  Whoa. Nice shot, Bolin!  But I thought you were supposed to be practicing metalbending, not earthbending.
Wei says:  Yeah, cheater. 
Bolin says: Mako, metalbending is extremely difficult. No one gets it right away, if they can get it at all! It's not normal! 
Korra says:  Woo-hoo!  Metalbending champion!
Bolin says: Oh sure. She's the Avatar.
Asami says: Guys, it's time to get cleaned up. Tonight is Opal's farewell dinner.
Bolin says:  Oh, now I have to say bye to Opal? This is the worst day ever! 
</scene>

<scene>
Opal says: Thanks for making my favorite meal.
Chef says: I'm really going to miss you, Opal. No one appreciates my raw veggie wraps like you do. 
Bolin says:  Every time I eat raw kale, I'm going to think of you.
Opal says: You're so sweet.
Bolin says: This stinks! We were just starting to get to know each other, and now you're off to the Northern Air Temple.
Opal says: We'll be together soon. You guys are coming up after finding more airbenders, right?
Bolin says: Yeah, but that's ... in the future. Ugh, I hate the future!
Opal says:  Until then, we'll always have kale.
Varrick says:  Kid, can I give you some relationship advice?
Bolin says:  Umm, no.
Varrick says: Well, your loss.  Zhu Li!  bring the, uh, thing.  Check out my latest invention:  an airbender finder. 
Korra says:  Wait, that can find airbenders? 
Asami says:  Uh ...  I think  it's broken.
Varrick says:  It's not broken. She needs to  airbend into it!  How else do you expect the thing to work? 
Mako says:  What's going on? I can't hear anything. I hate sitting down here!  Uh, not because of you.
Aiwei says:  I can tell you're lying.
</scene>

<scene>
Suyin says: Everyone, if I could have your attention please? Tonight, my beautiful little girl leaves for the Northern Air Temple.  Opal, none of us could be more proud of you. You're an incredible daughter, sister, friend,  and soon to be  airbending master.  Here's to Opal. May she help lead us into the new era! 
</scene>

<scene>
Kuvira says:  Lock it down for the night. 
Lin says:  We'll head out first thing in the morning.
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says:  Kale, kale, kale ... Opal ...
Bolin says: What?  What's going on?  Pabu, sleep!
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says:  Huh? What? Oh, Pabu.  It's not play time right now. Okay, we are seriously going to have to have a talk-  What the heck?! They've got Korra. They've got Korra! 
Mako says:  Let her go!  They've got Korra!
Ming-Hua says: So much for the element of surprise.
Ghazan says: Back-up plan.
Mako says: We can't let them take her.
Asami says: I don't think they're going to get far. Look!
Kuvira says: We have you surrounded. It's over. Release the Avatar!
Bolin says: No way! That guy is lavabending! That's awesome ... ly not good for us.
</scene>

<scene>
Zaheer says: I'm going to create some cover. We've got to get out of here!
Lin says:  How did they get in here? 
Suyin says: I don't know, but we're not letting them escape!
Asami says: There's no way to cross that moat.
Suyin says:  We don't need to cross it. Lin and I can drop in from the dome on cables.
Lin says:  That's a great idea. Except we'll get blown up the second that third-eyed freak sees us. 
Suyin says: She's a combustionbender. If one of you can stun her, her powers will be knocked out temporarily.
Mako says: Bolin can land a shot.
Bolin says: I can?
Suyin says: You have to take her out right before we drop down.
Bolin says: I do?
</scene>

<scene>
Wing says: Open the hatch. 
Suyin says: If we get in trouble, metalbend us up.
Wing says:  We're in position.
Mako says: Copy that. It's Bolin time.
Bolin says: All right. Bolin time. Bolin time!  I can't get a clean shot!
Mako says: You have to!
Wing says:  Are we a go?
Mako says: No go!
Wing says: Copy that, we're a go.
Mako says: I said no! Wait!  Bolin, take the shot!
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Haha, nice job, little bro!
Zaheer says: No!
</scene>

<scene>
Lin says: Thanks.
Zaheer says: We've failed!
</scene>

<scene>
Lin says: Where did they go?
Suyin says: They can't be far!  Guards, search the entire estate!
</scene>

<scene>
Aiwei says:  This should neutralize  the shirshu toxins.
</scene>

<scene>
Lin says:  How could you let this happen?!  You assured me this was one of the most  secure places in the world.
Suyin says: It is. I don't know how this happened. Obviously this was a well-planned operation, so  don't blame me.
Kuvira says: We searched the entire estate. There's no sign of them.
Lin says: Well, keep looking! 
Aiwei says: It would seem they had some inside knowledge of Zaofu. They must've been working with someone.
Korra says:  The-  the guards. It had to be one of them.
Aiwei says: I agree.
Suyin says: Question them all! Whoever betrayed my city will suffer the consequences!
</scene>

<scene>
Aiwei says: What is your full name?  Where were you last night?  Do you have any knowledge of the people who tried to kidnap the Avatar? 
Zhu Guan says: My name is Zhu Guan.
Second guard says:  I was patrolling the south wall of the Beifong estates.
Third guard says:  I have absolutely no knowledge of the people who tried to kidnap Korra.
</scene>

<scene>
Varrick says: What was I doing last night?  Same thing I always do. From nine to ten, I checked my body for ticks. Lyme disease is a serious killer.  Then I did my nightly  Varrick calisthenics, followed by  thirty minutes of breath holding. I filmed the whole thing if you want to watch it.
</scene>

<scene>
Aiwei says: That won't be necessary.
Lin says: Maybe it wasn't a guard after all. Maybe it was someone a little higher up the food chain. Aiwei, why don't you question Su?
Korra says: Lin, stop! Your sister was not involved!
Suyin says: No,  I'll gladly be questioned. I have nothing to hide. 
Aiwei says:  What is your full name?
Suyin says: Suyin Beifong. I'm the daughter of Toph and  the only sister to Lin, and I had nothing to do with the attack last night.
Aiwei says:  She is telling  the truth.
Korra says: This is a waste of time! Just bring in the next guard!
Aiwei says: Give me your name and tell me where you are from.
Hong Li says: I'm Hong Li. I was born and raised here in Zaofu.
Aiwei says: Do you have any knowledge of the people who tried to kidnap the Avatar?
Hong Li says: No.
Aiwei says:  Did you help the attackers enter Zaofu last night?
Hong Li says: No, of course not.
Aiwei says:  You're lying.
Hong Li says:  What?! No, I'm not! 
Suyin says: How did they get in and out?  Where are they now?
Hong Li says:  I don't know! I'm telling you, I didn't help them!
Suyin says: You're a traitor to the entire clan!
Aiwei says: I suggest we search his place.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: I got something!
Bolin says:  What? 
Mako says:  It looks like it's from them.  "Team assembled. Ready to rendezvous."
Asami says:  And look at this.
Aiwei says:  These are the guards' logbooks. All their schedules and routes are in here.
Korra says: That guard knows everything.  We have to get him to talk.
Mako says: Let's go confront him with this evidence right now.
Aiwei says: No.  Let's give him a little time to sweat it out. He will talk eventually.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: I don't understand why we're not talking to that guard right now.  Every minute we waste here, those guys get further away. I mean, how does a random guard get involved with a group of super criminals anyway?
Asami says: What do you mean?
Mako says: That guard is only eighteen years old and has lived in Zaofu his entire life. Zaheer and his gang have been in prison for more than thirteen years.
Korra says: I don't know, but we all saw the evidence. It's pretty overwhelming.
Varrick says:  Maybe a little too overwhelming?
Bolin says: Hey, Varrick. What are you doing here?
Varrick says: Collecting pumice stones with Zhu Li. That lavabender did a lot of damage, but he makes a nice exfoliating rock, and when you got callouses like mine, you take all the pumice stones you can get your hands on. Or in my case, feet.
Mako says: What were you saying about the evidence?
Varrick says: I was saying that I can smell a conspiracy when I see one. Look, if I was trying to set someone up, I would tell everyone he's guilty and then plant the evidence in his apartment as proof.
Mako says: Oh, you mean exactly like what you did to me?
Varrick says: Yes, just like that! Remember how great that worked? Well, not for you.
Mako says: You're right. All the evidence points to this guard, but maybe he's just the fallback.
Bolin says: But for who?
Mako says: For the only person who can truly keep a secret in this city: Aiwei.
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: He's not home. Or he's hiding in there.  Or he's invisible.  Probably just not home.
Mako says: We have to get in there and find some evidence that links Aiwei to Zaheer, otherwise Su won't believe us. 
Asami says: It's just an empty book. 
Bolin says: Hmm, it's like a desert on a jar.
Mako says: Bolin, put that back! We don't want Aiwei to know we were in here if we can't find anything.  You forgot where it goes, didn't you?  These look like scuff marks. I think this bookshelf slides open. 
Korra says: What do you think is down there?
Bolin says: Could be a storage cellar.
Mako says: Or it could be how Zaheer got in and out.
Asami says: Aiwei's coming back! Quick.
Aiwei says: What are doing in my house? You are trespassing on the property of one of the highest-ranked officials in the city. You'd better have a good explanation.
Bolin says: We do. We do. We actually knocked on your front door and we thought we heard you say,  'Come in, I'm in the bathroom!'  I don't even know why I'm saying that. You know I'm lying, and you don't even sound like that.
Korra says: We came here because things weren't adding up, and we thought you might have some answers.
Aiwei says:  Sit. If you want to talk, let's talk over some tea.  Now, what is not adding up exactly? Hong Li was clearly lying and we found evidence in his apartment.
Mako says: But don't you think it's weird how young he is? How did he ever get mixed up with this group?
Aiwei says:  Perhaps through a relative, or maybe he was bribed. We will find out those answers in time. But if wasn't him, who do you think it was?
Asami says: We don't know.
Aiwei says:  You don't think I had something to do with this, do you?
Korra says: We're just looking for answers.
Aiwei says: And you think you've found something, don't you?  You have no idea what is coming for you, Avatar.
Mako says: Come on, he's getting away!
Korra says: I'm still a little new at this, so back off!  Ugh!
Mako says: He's gone.
Korra says:  Look, he must've escaped through there! Help me clear it out.
Lin says: What happened? We heard an explosion.
Suyin says: Where's Aiwei?
Korra says: Your trusted adviser is the one who betrayed us. He was lying about the guard.
Suyin says: What? No!
Korra says: We confronted him and he bolted through here.
Lin says: He must have collapsed the tunnel behind him.
Mako says: And he rigged an explosion to destroy any evidence that might have been here.
Korra says: This is where Zaheer got in and out. Aiwei was the traitor.
Suyin says:  I ... trusted him.
Kuvira says:  Is everyone okay?
Lin says: Aiwei is a fugitive. Get all available guards to search the mountainside, and find out where this tunnel exits immediately!
</scene>

<scene>
Lin says: What did you find?
Kuvira says: We located the end of the tunnel, but there's no sign of him. Just some fresh tire tracks. 
Mako says: He had an escape plan all ready to go.
Suyin says: I trusted him with my life. I thought we were family, but it was all a lie.
Mako says: Whoever these guys are, they're more powerful than we thought, and more dangerous.
Korra says: That's why we have to find them. We're going to hold off our search for airbenders and hunt down Aiwei. Naga can track his scent.
Asami says: And I bet if we find Aiwei, we'll find Zaheer.
Lin says: No! We're not hunting this group. There could be other secret agents in other parts of the world looking for you right now! I'm taking you back to Republic City, where I can protect you.
Korra says: If I wasn't safe here, then I'm not safe anywhere. I have to stop them!
Lin says: It's too dangerous! You are not going!
Korra says: Stop trying to protect me! I'm the Avatar. This is my job!
Lin says: Don't lecture me about jobs!
Suyin says: Enough! Korra, listen to Lin.
Korra says: But ... they ...
Suyin says: Please. Lin's only looking out for you. I promise you, Aiwei and everyone he's working with will be brought to justice.
Korra says: Fine, if you really think it's best.
Suyin says: I do.
Lin says: Thank you, Su.
Suyin says: Everyone should get some rest tonight. I'll have my people prep your airship and you can leave first thing in the morning.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Su.
Suyin says: You really think Naga could track Aiwei?
Korra says: Definitely.
Suyin says: Then, here.  There's a jeep packed with supplies on the east gate. It's all gassed up and ready to go.
Korra says: What? Why?
Suyin says: Because I want you to hunt down Aiwei and bring him back to me.
Bolin says: But you said -
Suyin says: I said what Lin wanted to hear and I bought you guys some time. Go. I'll deal with Lin in the morning.
Korra says: Let's get this guy!  Thanks.

Shiro Shinobi says:  Korra is safely back in Republic City, but Bolin and Varrick are still on the lam! Weeks ago, Korra removed the remaining poison from her body, but the memory of Zaheer's attack still torments her and, after being defeated by Kuvira, she questions if she will ever fully recover. Meanwhile, Kuvira has been secretly harvesting spirit vines from the swamp, but how close is she to completing her spirit energy weapon?

Ryu says: Everyone! Mom! Can we stay together, please? The tour is about to begin.
Ryu's mother says: That's my boy. Ryu, he used to live in the basement, but then he got airbending, and he's been doing important Air Nation stuff all over the world.  His father and I are here, visiting him and, we're just having the best time in the big city, we're so proud. Right, honey?
Ryu's father says: Well, at least he has a job now.
Ryu says:  Mom, Dad, I'm trying to work!
</scene>

<scene>
Ryu says:  Fun fact, everyone. All these vines were created by UnaVaatu when he battled giant spirit Korra for the fate of the world.
Tourist #1 says:  Excuse me, are we in the Spirit World right now?
Ryu says:  No.
Tourist #1 says:  Is the Spirit World in the ground below us?
Ryu says:  No! Can I just get through my cards?
Ryu's mother says:  Aw, honey, don't get flustered.
Ryu says:  I'm not!
Tourist #1 says: Uhh, why is that vine coming toward us?
Ryu says:  Uh ... I don't see anything about that in the cards.
Tourist #1 says:  I'm gonna poke it with a stick.
Ryu says: No! Why would you do that?
Ryu says: Everyone back!
Ryu's mother says: This tour is exciting!
Ryu's mother says:  Isn't Ryu the best airbender ever?
</scene>

Korra says: Everything okay?
Opal says: No. Kuvira has my family and no one seems to care but me.
Korra says:  We all care. Don't worry, we'll get them back safely.
Jinora says: Guys, there you are! I just felt a weird surge of spiritual energy coming from the Spirit Wilds. Something's wrong.
</scene>

<scene>
Opal says: Are you sure you felt a disturbance? Maybe you just had some bad food for breakfast.
Jinora says:  I'm telling you, I felt it. Maybe something happened to Ryu's tour group. We should've run into them by now.
Korra says: Yeah, but it's Ryu. They might be at the mall, for all we know.
Jinora says: Korra, can't you feel how strange the energy is?
Korra says: No ... but maybe I can get a reading.
Opal says:  Korra, what is it? Are you okay?
Korra says: It was Kuvira. I saw her taking vines from the swamp. It must be affecting our Spirit Wilds. I bet that's what you were sensing, Jinora.
Jinora says: Why is she taking vines?
Korra says: Whatever the reason, I'm sure it's not good.
Opal says: We have to tell Raiko. This might help him convince the other leaders to finally take her down!
Jinora says: I'll keep looking for Ryu and the others.
</scene>

<scene>
Raiko says:  I say we deal with this Kuvira situation immediately.
Wu says:  Yes! Agreed! And I know just how to get rid of her: we tell her she won an all-expense paid vacation to a tropical island. Then, when she gets there, we reveal that it was a trap. The island's a prison! Boom! Got her!  Or, okay, uh, I'm just spitballing here. We march in with an army of highly trained badgermoles!  Do we know if Kuvira has any allergies?
Raiko says: Look, I think we all know what must be done. We take the fight to her.
Tenzin says:  I don't believe attacking is the right move, since she hasn't done anything aggressive toward the United Republic.
Lin says: Not yet. But Kuvira can't be trusted. She told us that she was going to turn over power and she didn't. I'm with Raiko. I say we go on the offensive and start by retaking Zaofu.
Korra says: President Raiko, I'm sorry to interrupt, but ...  What's going on here?
Wu says:  Oh, hey, Avatar Korra. Just kickin' it world leader-style, trying to figure out what to do about Kuvira. For the record, I told Raiko he should've invited you.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  You invited him,  but not me?
Tenzin says: Please, Korra, it's not personal. We just thought, perhaps we called you back into action a little too soon.
Korra says: Again, him, not me?!
Raiko says:  Korra, we're in the middle of a meeting and we can't have people just barge in whenever they want!
Bolin says: Guys!  Oh,  perfect! You're all here.
</scene>

<scene>
Opal and Mako says:  Bolin? 
Raiko says:  What are you doing here?! Guards, remove these traitors!
Bolin says:  No! We escaped Kuvira's army!  We're back on your side now!  We have top secret information for you!
</scene>

<scene>
Varrick says:  Okay, I guess we should've opened with that line.
Bolin says: Listen to me. Kuvira's making this thing that goes  I don't know how it works, but it has this 
Varrick says:  It's a super weapon! Like a regular weapon, only super.
Korra says:  And let me guess: it has something to do with spirit vines.
Varrick says:  Yes! How did you know?
Korra says: I saw a vision of her taking spirit vines from the swamp.
Varrick says: If she figures out how to harness their power, we are all doomed.
Raiko says:  She might use the weapon to attack Republic City. The only way to protect ourselves is with a preemptive strike.
Tenzin says:  My airbenders won't be part of an unprovoked attack!
Izumi says: Neither will the Fire Nation. 
Raiko says:  But, Fire Lord Izumi, Kuvira is a threat to the world! She has to be stopped!
Izumi says:  The Fire Nation has spent too much of its history  fighting nonsense wars.  And I refuse to drag my nation into another one  unless there is no other choice.  If you attack Kuvira, you'll do it without my army.
Raiko says: Fine. I'll hold off any plans of attack. We'll go on the defensive and fortify security on the borders.
Izumi says: In that,  you'll have my help.
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: Opal, wait! Please,  I just want to say that I'm sorry for everything.
Opal says:  I'm glad you're okay, but it's a little late for "sorry".
Bolin says: I know, I know.  I didn't listen to you, and I  sided with Kuvira, and I helped her take over the Earth Kingdom, and topple your home, and get your  mom captured, and  your brothers, and your dad ...  Wow, that does sound really bad when I say it out loud like that. But I'm gonna make it up to you.
Lin says: Pardon me, lovebirds, but I need a word with Opal.  Privately.  I'm sorry, kid, but Raiko couldn't convince the other leaders to attack Kuvira.
Opal says: So our family ...
Lin says: Looks like we're going to have to save them ourselves.
Opal says: Don't you think some other people would agree to go with us?
Lin says: This is an unsanctioned and dangerous mission into enemy territory. We can't ask other people to risk their necks for our family. If we want to break them out, we'll have to do it alone.
Mako says: Bolin, I'm so glad you're back. I was worried about you.
Korra says: We all were. 
Bolin says: Thanks, guys. Mako, I'm so sorry about the way we left things. I'm such an idiot. You tried to warn me about Kuvira and I ran off anyway, like an idiot. You were right and I'm just an idiot. I hope ... that ... I'll be able to earn your trust again.
Korra says: If anyone has lost people's trust, it's me. Ever since Kuvira kicked my butt, no one even wants me around.
Mako says:  We want you around.  And Bolin, you're not an idiot. You were just doing what you thought was right.
Bolin says: Aww, I love you guys. And I really wanna hug again. 
</scene>

<scene>
Jinora says: Korra! The vines! They're taking me! Help!
Lin says: Get everyone out of here. Put up a perimeter. Cancel all tours. Somebody get a hold of Tenzin.
Korra says:  We gotta get in there and find Jinora.
Lin says: I don't think anyone should be going in there right now.
Korra says: I know I'm not the old Avatar I used to be, but I can do this.
Lin says:  Be careful.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Jinora!
Mako says: Hello, anyone?  Wait. Do you hear that?
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Come on!
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Korra, look.  What are those? 
Korra says: It's Jinora and the rest of them. Their spirits are trapped in the Spirit World.
Mako says:  Let's get them out.
Korra says:  Don't! You'll provoke the vines. Let me try.  They won't open.  Maybe if I meditate into the Spirit World, I can free them.
Korra says: Wait ... this isn't the Spirit World.
Korra says: Zaheer! No!
Zaheer says: You can't fight me and the poison!
Korra says:  No ... I got it out!
Zaheer says: You'll never get it out!
Mako says: Korra! What's wrong?
Korra says:  It's Zaheer.
Mako says: What are you talking about?
Korra says: He's been haunting me ever since I fought him. I can't get any peace. It's like he's blocking me from meditating into the Spirit World. 
Mako says: I'm here for you. What do you need?
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: I want to face Zaheer.
Tenzin says:  Korra, he's too dangerous. Even when he's locked up, he can't be trusted.
Korra says: I need to if I wanna save Jinora and the others. There's no other way.
Tenzin says: There is another way. I'm calling your father. He can lead an expedition into the Spirit World from the Southern portal.
Korra says:  You've lost faith in me, too, haven't you?  No one thinks I'm capable of anything anymore.
Tenzin says:  It's not that at all.
Korra says:  I know I can do this.
Tenzin says: I'm just so worried for Jinora. I can't imagine if something happened to you, too.
Korra says:  Tenzin, please. I'll be okay.
Tenzin says:  Zaheer's imprisoned deep in the mountains outside the city. I'll call Raiko and get the clearance.
Korra says:  Thank you.
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: Pab-pabs, where are you?  Pabu! Oh, I missed you so much!  So, I don't know if you've heard, but Opal's kind of mad at me. I was hoping ... you could help me win her back.  Awesome! Yes, I have an idea.
</scene>

<scene>
Opal says: Hello, Pabu.  Well, it's good to see you, too.  What do you got there?
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: Opal, you made it!
Opal says: What's this?
Bolin says: A picnic, just for the two of us! Well, the three of us. Sorry, Pabs.
Opal says: So, this note Pabu brought me saying you broke both of your legs was just a ruse?
Bolin says: Maybe ... but now that you're here, don't you want to just sit back, relax, try some of my homemade steam buns  —Pema's recipe—and watch Pabu do some of his world-famous backflips for entertainment? Ha-hah!
Opal says:  Oh. Steam buns. My favorite. This will totally make me forget that you worked for Kuvira, the person who captured my family and is probably torturing them right now. So yeah, let's just sit down and have a great picnic because we're so in love!  I'm sorry you had to see that, Pabu. 
</scene>

<scene>
Raiko says: Thank you both for coming.
Varrick says: It's nice to be welcomed back with open arms.
Raiko says: Actually, I brought you here out of necessity. It's no secret I never liked you. Especially after you tried to have me kidnapped.
Varrick says: Allegedly.
Asami says:  Right. Everything you do is "allegedly". Like when you took over my company and bombed the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center!
Varrick says: I own that building! A man has a right to blow up his own property!
Raiko says: Right now, I need you to put aside your differences. If Kuvira really is creating a super weapon, we're going to need the two brightest minds in the city working together to stop it.
Varrick says: What do you say, Asami?  Partners again?
Asami says:  Fine. I'll help.  But don't even think about double-crossing me again. 
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Are you sure you're ready for this?
Korra says: Yes. I think if I see Zaheer chained up, I'll finally realize that he's not a threat anymore.
White Lotus guard says: Approach the wall. 
Korra says: No. I need to do this alone.
Zaheer says: I figured you would show up sooner or later. So ... you must really be in trouble if you came all the way down here to see me.
Korra says: I came here to look you in the eye and tell you that you have no power over me. I will no longer be scared of you.
Zaheer says:  I guess it didn't work. You still seem scared.
Korra says: This was a mistake. 
Zaheer says: I know why you're here.
Korra says: You don't know anything about me!
Zaheer says: You can't go into the Spirit World. I spend most of my time in the Spirit World and it's well known that the Avatar's spirit hasn't been there for a few years.
Korra says: You can meditate into the Spirit World from here? Doesn't feel very spiritually charged.
Zaheer says: This is your problem. Republic City is flowing with spiritual energy and you can't even tap into it.
Korra says: No, my problem is you! You poisoned me! You've ruined me! People used to think I was unstoppable, but now they don't think I'm capable of anything!
Zaheer says: Blaming me is a crutch to make you feel better, but it's not helping you recover.
Korra says: I thought seeing you face-to-face would put an end to all of this. But maybe it's time I realize I'll never be the same.
Zaheer says: Neither of us are the same as before. I learned to fly, but now I'm bound in chains. You have all the power in the world and the freedom to use it, but you choose to hold yourself down.
Korra says: I'm not holding myself down, but my powers have limits!
Zaheer says: You're wrong. That poison should've killed you, but you were able to fight it off. You think your power has limits; I say, it's limitless.
Korra says: Whatever. Before, you were always talking about chaos and freedom. Then you took out the Earth Queen and created the worst dictator the Earth Kingdom has ever seen. Thanks for that!
Zaheer says: I've heard rumors about her, but I didn't know she achieved so much power. She needs to be stopped.
Korra says: Well, I can't stop her unless I get over this block.
Zaheer says: I think I can help. Let me lead you into the Spirit World.
Korra says: No way. I can't trust you.
Zaheer says: Maybe not. But if you had any other options, you wouldn't be here now, would you? We may have been enemies once, but for now, our interests align.
Korra says: I've come this far. What have I got to lose? 
Zaheer says:  Focus on the sound of my voice and clear your mind.  Let it play out.
Korra says: I can't!
Zaheer says: You can. Accept what happened to you. Don't fear what might have been.
Korra says: I have no control!
Zaheer says:  Don't be afraid. Hold on!
Korra says: I made it ... and you led me here. Do you know where Jinora and the others are?
Zaheer says: No, but you do.
Korra says: Raava, I missed you. Where have you been?
Raava says: I have always been inside of you.
Korra says: Can you help me find Jinora?  How do I release their spirits?
Raava says: You must bend the energy within.
Korra says: But I'm powerless in the Spirit World.
Raava says: No. You're most powerful here. In the Spirit World, you're connected to all the spiritual energy.

Mako says: So ... how are you doing?
Korra says: I feel ... whole again. I feel good.
Mako says: Do you think you're finally able to forget about what Zaheer did to you?
Korra says: No. But I am finally able to accept what happened and I think that's gonna make me stronger.

Bolin says: Where are you going?
Opal says: We've got some family business to take care of.
Bolin says: All right, listen. Before you go, I just want to tell you that I understand how you feel. I know there is nothing I could do or no big gesture that could make up for all my mistakes, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna stop trying to win you back because ... I love you.
Opal says: Thanks for saying all of that.  You know ... there is one thing you could do to win me back.
Bolin says:  What is it? Yes, I'll do anything!
Opal says:  Come on a secret mission with us.
Bolin says: Where to?
Opal says: Zaofu. We're going to rescue my family.

Tenzin says: Earth. Fire. Air. Water. Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
Shiro Shinobi says:  Republic City welcomes a new citizen into our arms. Avatar Korra! After years of seclusion in the South, this master of water, earth, and fire seeks to add airbending to her list of skills. And under the tutelage of Tenzin, Avatar Aang's son, she should go far. But will this cool, calm, collective master of air be able to tame this hotheaded teen?
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  And, in the final round, the Buzzard Wasps  won with a decisive knockout!  What do you say we go to the arena tonight,  catch a few pro-bending matches?
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says:  That sport is a mockery of the noble tradition of bending. 
Korra says: Come on, Tenzin! I've dreamed about seeing a pro-bending match since I was a kid  and now I'm just a ferry ride away from  the arena.
Tenzin says:  Korra, you're not here to watch that drivel. You're here to finish your Avatar training.  So, for the time being, I want you to remain on the island.
Korra says:  Is that why you're keeping the White Lotus sentries around,  to watch my every move?
Tenzin says: Yes. In order to learn airbending I believe you require a calm,  quiet environment, free from any distractions.
Korra says:  All right,  you're the master.
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says: So, my mother informed me that  you've never been able to airbend before.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  Yeah, but I don't know why. The other elements came so easily to me,  but every single time I've tried airbending-  nothing.
Tenzin says:  That's perfectly all right. You just need to be patient.  Often the element that's the most difficult for the Avatar to master is the one most opposite to the Avatar's personality.  For Aang, it was earthbending.
Korra says:  Yeah. Well, I'm about as opposite an airbender as you can get.
Tenzin says:  Let's begin your first lesson.
</scene>

<scene>
Ikki says:  Korra's gonna airbend! Korra's gonna airbend!
Korra says:  What is that contraption?
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says: A time-honored tool that teaches the most fundamental aspect of airbending. Jinora, would you like to explain this exercise?
Jinora says:  The goal is to weave your way through the gates and make it to the other side without touching them.
Korra says:  Seems easy enough.
Ikki says:  Jinora forgot to say that you have to make it through while the gates are spinning.
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says:  The key is to be like the leaf.  Flow with the movement of the gates.  Jinora will demonstrate.
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says:  Airbending is all about spiral movements. When you meet resistance, you must be able to switch direction at a moment's notice.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  Let's do this!
</scene>

<scene>
Jinora says:  Don't force your way through!
</scene>

Ikki says:  Dance! Dance like the wind!

Shiro Shinobi says:  Ladies and gentlemen! I'm coming to you live from Republic City's Pro-bending Arena, where tonight the best in the world continue their quest  for a spot in the upcoming championship tournament.  Grab your snacks and grab your kids because this next match is gonna be a doozy!
</scene>

Shiro Shinobi says: This Mako's got moxy! He advances, fires two quick shots.  Yomo is hammered back to zone three!  Clock is winding down, can Yomo hold on?  He's teetering on the edge of the ring now.  The Fire Ferrets line up to strik-
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says:  Korra, come down here please.
Korra says:  You shut it off at the best part!
Tenzin says:  I thought I made myself clear. I don't want you listening to this distracting nonsense.
Korra says:  But it's their radio. And technically, you said I couldn't watch a match.  You didn't say anything about listening to one.
Tenzin says:  You-  ... you know what I meant!  Anyway shouldn't y-? Shouldn't you be in bed by now?
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  I think I'm doing it wrong.
Tenzin says:  There's nothing to do. Let your mind and your spirit be free,  for air is the element of freedom.  Is something ... funny?
Korra says:  Yeah, you're telling me to embrace freedom, but you won't even let me listen to the radio. And forget about leaving this island!
Tenzin says:  Please, Korra.  Look at Meelo; he's able to meditate peacefully.
Korra says: Actually, I think he's asleep.
Tenzin says:  What? Well, at least he has the relaxing part down.
Korra says:  Whatever. None of this airbending stuff makes any sense to me.
Tenzin says:  I know you're frustrated, but these teachings will sink in over time. Then one day, they'll just click. 
Korra says:  Yeah, it's not sinking in yet.  I'm gonna go get a glass of lychee juice.
Tenzin says:  Korra, the meditation's not over yet!
Ikki says:  Daddy, can I have some lychee juice too?
Tenzin says:  No.

Korra says:  Uh, I was just looking for a bathroom and I got lost.
Toza says:  Ah, the old "I had to pee" excuse!  You know, I'm sick and tired of you kids sneakin' in without payin'!  I'm taking you to security!
Korra says: No, wait!
Bolin says:  There you are! I've been looking everywhere for you!  It's all right Toza,  she's with me.
Korra says:  Yeah, I'm with him.
Bolin says: So, you see, we're together.
Korra says:  Well, not together together, more like friends.
Bolin says: Right, friends.  No, no, I didn't mean to imply. 
Korra says:  Oh, you implied it.
Toza says:  Ah, I don't care what you are! I got work to do.
Bolin says: Rrright this way, miss.

Korra says: And thank you, sir!  Seriously, thanks.

Bolin says: Whaddya think? Best seats in the house, huh?
Korra says:  Whoa! Unbelievable!  This place is even more amazing than I imagined!
Bolin says: Name's Bolin, by the way.
Korra says:  Korra.
Mako says:  Psst,  Bolin.
Bolin says: Yeah?
Mako says:  I told you, you have to stop bringing your crazy fangirls in here before the matches. Get her out of here.
Bolin says:  Come on, Mako! Right, look, I kinda promised her she could stay,  but man, I got a good feeling, there's somethin' special about her. I know it!  Come here, I want you to meet my brother, Mako.
Korra says:  Mako? Wow, I-I heard you playing on the radio.
Mako says:  Come on, Bolin, we're up.
Korra says:  ... or I could meet him later.
Bolin says:  Yeah, sorry about that. My brother just gets real ... focused before a match.  Okay, I gotta go, wish me luck.  Not ... that I'll need it.
Korra says:  Good luck.  Knock 'em out!
</scene>

<scene>
Ring announcer says: Introooooducing  the Fire Ferrets!
</scene>

Fangirl says:  Aaaaaah! I love you, Bolin! Aaaaaah!
Shiro Shinobi says:  The rookie Ferrets came from out of nowhere  and have made it further than anyone expected this season.  But tonight, they face their toughest test yet, folks.
</scene>

<scene>
Shiro Shinobi says:  And they're off! The two teams waste no time trying to blast each other out of zone one!
</scene>

<scene>
Shiro Shinobi says:  Hasook is the first to feel the heat of the Tigerdillos! He tries to return the favor, but they're too fast for him, while Mako shows off his trademark "cool under fire" style!
</scene>

<scene>
Shiro Shinobi says:  Oooh, the Tigerdillos score with a walloping one-two combo!
Shiro Shinobi says: Can their teammate hold on to their zone one territory? Guess not!  Mako's over the line!  The Tigerdillos get the green light and advance into Ferret territory!
Korra says:  Come on, Ferrets!
Shiro Shinobi says: Looks like Hasook's in trouble! He's in zone three teetering over the drink!  And Hasook takes a dip! He'll be back for round two!
</scene>

<scene>
Shiro Shinobi says: Assuming the fabulous bending brothers can hold their ground until the next round.
Announcer says:  Round one goes to the  Golden Temple Tigerdillos!
Mako says:  Come on, Hasook! Get your act together!
</scene>

<scene>
Shiro Shinobi says:  The Fire Ferrets are knocked into zone two and the Tigerdillos advance!
</scene>

<scene>
Shiro Shinobi says:  The Fire Ferrets cinch the round in the closing seconds! It's one apiece,  still anyone's match as we go into the third and final round!
</scene>

<scene>
Shiro Shinobi says:  Hasook stumbles, and now he tumbles right into his teammate!  He and Bolin better untangle quick if they don't want to ...  oh, too late!
Korra says:  Oh, no!
Shiro Shinobi says:  It's all up to Mako now!  He's bobbing and weaving! He's weaving and bobbing!  But he's not hitting back!  If Mako's knocked out, the Ferrets' fabulous season is over!  He is dancing on the edge of the ring, surviving the three on one barrage! It seems his plan is to let the Tigerdillos punch themselves out!  And his plan is working! Han is in the pool!  They've got nothing left in the tank and Mako is on the offensive!  It's two on one!  Scratch that, it's one on one, and it's an earth and fire slllugfest! There's so much smoke and dust from the firefight, I can't even see where the Fire Ferret is!
</scene>

<scene>
Shiro Shinobi says:  It's a knockout! What a wing-dinger of a hat trick, folks!  Mako pulls off the upset of the season, winning the match for the Fire Ferrets!
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: Woohoo! Yes!  One more win and we're in the championship tournament!  So, what'd ya think, Korra? Bolin's got some moves, huh?
Korra says:  What did I think? What did I think? That was am​azing!
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says:  You did more harm than good out there. You almost cost us the match!
Hasook says:  We won, didn't we?
Mako says: Barely!
Hasook says:  Get off my case, pal!  Ugh! 
Mako says:  Useless.
Korra says:  You guys were incredible out there!  Especially you, Mr. Hat Trick!
Mako says:  Oh, you're still here?
Korra says:  Oh, you're still a jerk?
Bolin says: Ooh! 
Korra says:  Anyway,  I've been immersed in bending my entire life, but I never learned how to move like that! It's like there's a whole new style here!  Think you could show me a few tricks?
Bolin says: Ab-so-lutely!
Mako says:  Right now? Come on, Bolin.
Bolin says:  Just ignore him.  Yeah, I could show you the basics.  I'm just not sure how my earthbending would translate to your waterbending,  but we'll figure it out.
Korra says:  Won't be a problem.  I'm actually an earthbender.
Bolin says:  I'm sorry, no, no! I didn't mean to assume. 'Cause I, you know, I was just figuring ... with your Water Tribe getup ... that you are ... a Water Tribe ... gal.
Korra says:  Nope, you're right. I'm a waterbender. And a firebender.
Bolin says:  Mm. Mm-hmm. I'm very confused right now.
Mako says:  You're the Avatar,  and I'm an idiot.
Korra says:  Both are true.
Bolin says:  No ... way.  Th​e Avatar!
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says:  All right! Let's see what'cha got!
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: That was great! Good power! But in a real match, you'd be a sitting turtle duck.  Not so upright and flatfooted!  Stay light on your toes, right up until the moment when you need to dig in and strike. Then ...  pop, pop!
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  Okay, let me try it again.
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says:  Wow! Nice adjustment!  You're a natural at this.
Mako says:  Not bad.
Korra says:  What's it take to impress this guy?
Mako says:  What? I said "not bad".  You know what, it's getting late.  I think I'm gonna turn in. You kids have fun.  Nice to meet you, Avatar Korra.
Korra says:  Yeah, been a real pleasure.
Mako says:  See ya upstairs, bro.
Korra says: Upstairs?  You guys live here?
Bolin says:  Yup. In the attic. It's nothin' fancy, but we have some great views!  So, back to bending. Why don't you throw that combo one more time?
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says:  Patience, Korra!
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says:  That was a two-thousand-year-old historical treasure!  What ...  What is wrong with you?!
Korra says:  There's nothing wrong with m​e! I've been practicing just like you taught me, but it isn't sinking in, okay?  It hasn't clicked like you said it would!
Tenzin says:  Korra, this isn't something you can force. If you would only listen to me ...
Korra says:  I have been! But you know what I think? Maybe the problem isn't me! Maybe the reason I haven't learned airbending yet is because  you're a terrible teacher!
Meelo says:  Yeah! You're a terrible teacher, Daddy!
</scene>

<scene>
Pema says:  Okay! Everyone here?  Wait. Where's Korra?
Tenzin says:  Honestly, Pema, I am at my wit's end with that girl! I ... I don't know how to get through to her!
Pema says:  Dear, the best thing you can do right now is to give Korra some space.
Tenzin says:  You must promise me that your teenage years won't be like this!
</scene>

<scene>
Jinora says:  I will make no such promises.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  I didn't miss your match, did I? You guys look like you lost already.
Bolin says:  We might as well have.
Mako says:  Hasook's a no-good no-show!
Referee says:  You got two minutes to come out ready to play, or you're disqualified. 
Mako says:  Well, there goes our shot at the tournament ... and the winnings.
Korra says:  Can't you ask one of those guys to fill in?
Bolin says: Nah. The rules say you can only compete on one team.
Korra says: Well, then ...  how about me? I'm a top-notch waterbender,  if I do say so myself.
Bolin says: But, you're the Avatar.  Isn't that cheating?
Korra says:  It isn't cheating if I only do waterbending.
Mako says: No way. I'd rather forfeit than look like a fool out there.
Korra says:  Wow, thanks for the vote of confidence.
Referee says:  Time's up. You in or out?
Korra says:  We're in!
Mako says:  We are?
Bolin says:  Yes!
Mako says:  Hey, I didn't agree to this!
Korra says: You can thank me later. 
Mako says:  This girl is crazy.
</scene>

<scene>
Shiro Shinobi says:  Looks like the Fire Ferrets have ferreted out a last minute replacement waterbender.  Let's see if she's another diamond in the rough like the brothers from the school of hard knocks!
Mako says:  Don't do anything too fancy or aggressive.  In fact, don't do anything. Just try not to get knocked off the ring.
Korra says: You got it, captain.
Referee says:  Players! Are you ready?
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  Woohoo! Man overboard!
Referee says:  Fire Ferret waterbender, penalty! Move back one zone!
Korra says:  What? Why?
Mako says:  You're only allowed to knock players off the back of the ring! Not over the sides!
Korra says:  Oh. Whoops.
Shiro Shinobi says:  And we're back in action after that hiccup, but I'm not so sure this replacement player knows what she's doing.
Referee says:  Foul! Over the line! Move back to zone three!
Korra says:  Urgh!  I'll show you over the line!
Shiro Shinobi says:  The Platypus Bears take round one!  The Platypus Bears know a green player when they see one, and they are focusing the brunt of their bending on this poor girl!
Shiro Shinobi says:  Wait a minute! Did that waterbender just earthbend?
Referee says:  Foul! I ... think.
Shiro Shinobi says:  Did I see that right?  Hold on, folks, we're just waiting for the referee's official call, but ...  I-I think this replacement player could be ... no, there's no way!
Tenzin says:  Pardon me, everyone, have you seen Korra this evening? She's not in her room.
Shiro Shinobi says:  You've gotta be kidding me!  She's the Avatar, folks!  Playing in a pro-bending match!  Can you believe that?
Tenzin says:  I'll get her myself!
</scene>

<scene>
Referee says:  The Avatar will be permitted to continue so long as she solely bends water!
Platypus Bears says:  Awww!
</scene>

<scene>
Shiro Shinobi says:  This girl may be the Avatar, but she's no pro-bender and the Platypus Bears are intent on exploiting that weakness!
Shiro Shinobi says:  They're giving her their best, and her best ain't good enough to stop it!
Shiro Shinobi says:  Aaaaand she's in the drink.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  Oh, hey, Tenzin. I thought you didn't like coming to these matches.
Tenzin says: Once again, you have flagrantly disobeyed my orders. You were to stay on the island! Let's go.
Korra says:  No! I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Tenzin says:  I have tried my very best to get through to you by being gentle and patient,  but clearly the only thing you respond to is force! So I am ordering you to come back to the temple right now!
Korra says:  Why? So I can sit around and meditate about how bad I am at airbending?  You know, I'm beginning to think there's a reason I haven't been able to learn it! Because, maybe, I don't even need it!
Tenzin says: What? That is a ludicrous suggestion!  The Avatar needs to learn airbending! It is not optional!
Korra says:  No! This is what I need to learn! Modern styles of fighting!
Tenzin says:  Being the Avatar isn't all about fighting, Korra!  When will you learn that?
Korra says:  I have a match to go finish.
Ring announcer says:  The Platypus Bears win round two!  Round three!
</scene>

<scene>
Shiro Shinobi says:  The Platypus Bears come out of the gate and quickly go after the Ferret brothers! They're corralled in the corner, wedged in the edge of zone one, unable to come to the Avatar's rescue! And boy, does she need it!
</scene>

<scene>
Shiro Shinobi says:  Looks like the Avatar's pro-bending debut is going to be cut short! She's been pushed back to zone three, and the water is calling her name!
</scene>

<scene>
Shiro Shinobi says:  It's only a matter of time before ...
Shiro Shinobi says:  Hold the phone! Stop the presses! She's still in the game, folks! And she's moving like an entirely different player! All of a sudden, the Platypus Bears' strikes are only striking air!
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says:  How about that?
</scene>

<scene>
Shiro Shinobi says:  The Platypus Bears have no juice left, but Mako and Bolin are still fresh and juicy!
</scene>

<scene>
Shiro Shinobi says:  Knockout!
Tenzin says: Woohoo!
Shiro Shinobi says:  The Fire Ferrets come from waaay behind and steal the win!  What an upset, folks! The rookies, Avatar in tow,  have nabbed a place in the championship tournament! I can not believe it!
Korra and Bolin says: Hahaha, yeah! Yes!
Mako says:  Korra ... what can I say? You really came alive in that last round. The way you dodged their attacks ... you are a natural.
Korra says: Thanks, but I can't take all the credit.  Someone else taught me those moves.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  I'm really sorry ... about everything I said.  I was really frustrated with myself,  and I took it out on you.
Tenzin says:  I think I owe you an apology too. I was trying to teach you about patience, but I lost mine.
Korra says:  No hard feelings?
Tenzin says:  Of course not. By the way, you were really good out there tonight.  You moved just like an airbender!
Korra says:  Wait ...  You stayed and watched?
Tenzin says:  I did. Pro-bending turned out to be the perfect teaching tool for you.
Korra says:  I'll see you tomorrow for airbending practice, bright and early!  And, by the way, I kinda permanently joined the Fire Ferrets and we're playing in the tournament in a couple of weeks!

With her new teammates, Mako and Bolin, the Fire Ferrets earn a place in the championship tournament. But meanwhile, an anti-bending revolution brews in Republic City. Who are the Equalists? And what nefarious plan does the mysterious man behind the mask have in store for our hero?

Butakha says: There are my little hard-working street urchins.  It's an honor to finally meet you, Avatar.
Korra says:  And you are ...?
Butakha says:  Butakha. I run this whole pro-bending shebang.  Here's your winnings from the last match.  Ah ah ah, not so fast.  First, you owe me for the Avatar's new gear,  gym and equipment rentals from last month,  rent on your apartment,  and a personal loan for groceries.
Bolin says:  What?  I'm a growing boy!
Butakha says:  Oh, and one more small item of business: The Fire Ferrets need to ante up thirty thousand yuans for the championship pot.
Bolin says:  Thirty thousand yuans?! 
Butakha says:  Sorry, kids. You got 'til the end of the week to come up with the dough, or else, you're out of the tournament.
Bolin says:  You wouldn't happen to have a secret Avatar bank account overflowing with gold, would you?
Korra says:  I got nothing.  I've never really needed money.  I've always had people taking care of me.
Mako says:  Then I wouldn't say you have nothing.
Korra says:  Sorry, I didn't mean —
Bolin says:  No, it's all right. It's just  ever since we lost our parents, we've been on our own.
Korra says:  I'm so sorry. I didn't know.
Mako says:  So, anyway,  how are we gonna come up with the money?
Bolin says:  Oh, oh, I got it!  I got it!  I've been training Pabu to do circus tricks. Now people would pay good money to see that!
Mako says:  Come on, Bolin.  We need serious ideas.
Bolin says:  I was serious.
Mako says:  Don't worry about it. I'll figure something out. I always do.

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen! You are too kind! Seriously, too kind! You can come back here and put money right in this-  Okay, that's fine, that's fine.  One yuan down, 29,999 to go.

Shady Shin says:  Heard you're a big time pro-bending player now. Not bad.
Bolin says:  Uh, thanks.
Shady Shin says:  So listen. I got an offer for ya. Lightning Bolt Zolt is lookin' to hire some extra muscle.
Bolin says:  Uh, I don't know, Shin. Mako told me to stay away from the Triple Threats.
Shady Shin says:  Pfuh, your brother ain't the boss of you.  It's just a little security work. Nothin' crooked.
Shady Shin says:  You game?
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Bo, I'm back!  Picked up your favorite dumplings!  Hey, I found some work down at the power plant.  Made some decent money.  Bolin?  You here, bro?  Huh, I bet the little lovebird is making a house call.
</scene>

<scene>
Jinora says:  Good. Light on your feet!
</scene>

<scene>
Jinora says:  Ooh, he's cute.  Korra, is that the  handsome firebender boy that drives you crazy?
Ikki says:  Does he drive you crazy in a bad way,  or does he drive you crazy like you like him?
Korra says:  Ahem. Oh. Hey, Mako.
Mako says:  You seen Bolin?
Korra says:  Nice to see you, too.  And no.  I haven't seen him since practice. Think something's wrong?
Mako says:  I don't know.  Bolin has a knack for getting into stupid situations.  See you later.
Korra says: Wait.  I could, uh ... help you look for him.
Mako says:  Nah. I got it.
Korra says:  Hey, cool guy, let me help you.  We can take Naga.
Mako says:  Who's Naga?
Korra says:  My best friend. And a great tracker.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Your best friend is a ... polar bear dog.  Somehow, that makes perfect sense.
Korra says:  I'll take that as a compliment, city boy.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Well, this is his usual hangout.  You guys seen my brother around here today?
Skoochy says:  Perhaps. My memory's a little ..."foggy".  Maybe you can help "clear it up".
Mako says:  You're good, Skoochy.  Humph, a real pro.
</scene>

<scene>
Skoochy says: Yeah, I seen him.
Mako says: When?
Skoochy says: About noon.
Mako says:  What was he doing?
Skoochy says: H-he was performing  some kind of monkey rat circus. And then ...
Mako says:  And then what? Why did he leave?
Skoochy says:  Shady Shin showed up and flashed some serious cash.  Bo took off with him in his hot rod.  The Triple Threats? The Red Monsoons? The Agni Kais? All the triads are muscling up for something real big. Now that's all you're getting outta me!
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: What's he talking about?
Mako says:  Sounds like there's a turf war brewing.  And Bolin's about to get caught right in the middle of it.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  So where're we headed?
Mako says:  The Triple Threat Triad's headquarters. Hopefully Bolin's there and nothing's gone down yet.
Korra says:  The Triple Threat Triad? I beat up some of those yahoos when I got into town. Why would Bolin get tangled up wit —
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Whoa, Naga!
Mako says:  That's Pabu!
Korra says:  No, Naga! Pabu's a friend, not a snack.
Mako says:  We gotta hurry.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says:  Something's not right.  There're usually thugs posted out front. We better be cautious.
Mako says: Bolin? You in here?
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Bolin!
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: Naga, come!
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  Ugh, I can't bend.  I can't bend!
Mako says: Calm down, it'll wear off.  Those guys were chi blockers.  They're Amon's henchmen.
Korra says: Amon?  That anti-bending guy with a mask?
Mako says: Yeah, he's the leader of the Equalists.
Korra says: What do they want with the Triple Threats?
Mako says: Whatever it is,  can't be good.  Urgh, can't believe Bolin got himself into this mess! 
Korra says: Mako,  we are going to save your brother.  I promise you that.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: We've been out all night.  No sign of him.
Mako says:  We've gotta keep looking. But where?
Korra says: Huh!  I have an idea!
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: The first day I got into town, I ran into an Equalist protester  over there.
Mako says:  And you think they'll know where Bolin is?
Korra says:  It's our only lead right now.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  So, why is Bolin running around with the Triple Threat Triad, anyway?
Mako says:  Well, we ... we used to do some work for them back in the day.
Korra says:  What? Wha- Are you some kind of criminal?
Mako says:  No! You don't know what you're talking about. I just ran numbers for them and stuff. We were orphans out on the street; I did what I had to do to survive and protect my little brother.
Korra says:  I'm sorry. It must have been really hard.  Can I ask what happened to your parents?
Mako says:  They were mugged, by a firebender. He cut them down right in front of me. I was eight.
Korra says:  Mako ...
Mako says:  Bolin's the only family I have left. If anything happened to him ...
</scene>

<scene>
Protester says:  Equality now! Equality now!  We want equality now!
Korra says: I-I ... er ... eheh, humn, hmmehem.
Protester says: Nonbenders of Republic City ...
Korra says:  That's the guy.
</scene>

<scene>
Protester says: Amon calls you to action! Take back your city! It's time for the ...  It's you again!  You cannot silence me, Avatar!
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  Shut your yapper and listen up. My friend got kidnapped by some chi blockers. Where'd they take him?
Protester says:  I have no idea what you're talking about.
Korra says:  Oh, I think you do.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says:  "Witness the Revelation tonight, nine o' clock".  What's this "Revelation"?
Protester says:  Nothing that concerns the likes of you two!
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  You better believe it concerns us. Spill it.
Protester says:  No one knows what the Revelation is! And I have no idea what happened to your friend.  But if he's a bender, then my bet is he's getting what's coming to him.
Mako says:  Where's it happening?
</scene>

<scene>
Policeman says:  Hey! What's going on over there?
Protester says:  The Avatar's oppressing us. Help!
Korra says:  Let's scram.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  Why didn't the Equalists put a location on these?
Mako says:  Probably because they don't want just anyone waltzing in to their big  "Revelation",  whatever that is.  I bet the information is hidden on here somehow. Look at the backs.  There's four different images.
Korra says:  So,  it's a puzzle?
Mako says:  Yeah, of a map!
Mako says:  Bingo.  That must be where it's going down.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: This is the place.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says:  What are you doing?
Korra says:  We'll attract less attention this way.
Doorman says:  This is a private event. No one gets in without an invitation.
Korra says: Uh ... invitation?
Mako says:  You mean this?
Doorman says:  The Revelation is upon us, my brother and sister.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: I knew a lot of people hated benders, but I've never seen so many in one place.  Keep your eyes out for Bolin.
</scene>

<scene>
Announcer says:  Please welcome your hero,  your savior ... Amon!
</scene>

<scene>
Amon says:  My quest for equality began many years ago.  When I was a boy, my family and I lived on a small farm. We weren't rich, and none of us were benders.  This made us very easy targets for the firebender who extorted my father.  One day, my father confronted this man, but when he did,  that firebender took my family from me. Then, he took my face.  I've been forced to hide behind a mask ever since.  As you know, the Avatar has recently arrived in Republic City.  And if she were here,  she would tell you that bending brings balance to the world. But, she is wrong. The only thing bending has brought to the world, is suffering.  It has been the cause of every war in every era.  But that is about to change.  I know you have been wondering, "What is the Revelation?"  You are about to get your answer.  Since the beginning of time,  the spirits have acted as guardians of our world, and they have spoken to me.  They say the Avatar has failed humanity.  That is why the spirits have chosen me to usher in a new era of balance. They have granted me a power  that will make Equality a reality. The power to take a person's bending away.  Permanently.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  That's impossible.  There's no way.
Mako says:  This guy's insane!
Amon says:  Now, for a demonstration. Please welcome, Lightning Bolt Zolt.  Leader of the Triple Threat Triad, and one of the most notorious criminals in Republic City. 
Lightning Bolt Zolt says:  Ah, boo yourself!
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: There's Bolin.
Mako says:  Wait, we can't fight them all. We need to be smart about this.
Korra says:  Then come up with a game plan,  "Team Captain".
Amon says:  Zolt has amassed a fortune by extorting and abusing nonbenders.  But his reign of terror is about to come to an end.  Now, in the interest of fairness,  I will give Zolt the chance to fight to keep his bending.
Lightning Bolt Zolt says:  You're gonna regret doing that, pal.
</scene>

<scene>
Lightning Bolt Zolt says:  Wha ... what did you do to me?
Amon says:  Your firebending is gone. Forever.  The era of bending is over. A new era of Equality has begun!
Shady Shin says:  No! Ugh!
Korra says:  Any ideas yet?
Mako says:  I think so, see those machines?  They're powered by water and steam. If you create some cover, I can grab Bolin  without anyone seeing. Then, we duck out of here.
Korra says: Works for me.  Mako, good luck. 
Mako says: You, too.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  It's not enough.
Doorman says:  Hey, you!
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  Is there a problem, my brother?
Doorman says:  What are you doing back here?
Korra says:  Uh ... looking for the bathroom?
</scene>

Mako says:  Come on ...
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  Thanks. This should be enough.

Bolin says:  Uh, hello, Amon, sir.  I think there's been a big misunderstanding.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Bolin, you all right?
Bolin says: Yes!  Mako! I love you!
</scene>

<scene>
Lieutenant says: You benders need to understand, there's no place in the world for you anymore.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: I wouldn't count us out just yet.  Naga!
Bolin says:  Hah ... Oh ... Yah ... Stop ... I want ... to be ... on ... your back ... please!
Lieutenant says:  The Avatar. That's her!
Amon says: Let her go.  She's the perfect messenger to tell the city of my power.
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says: Thank goodness.  I was just about to send out a search party.  Are you all right?  Korra, what happened? Did you find your friend?
Korra says:  Yes, but ...  I was at an Equalist rally.  I saw Amon.
Tenzin says:  What?
Korra says:  He can take people's bending away.  For good.
Tenzin says:  That's ...  that's impossible. Only the Avatar has ever possessed that ability.
Korra says:  But I saw him do it.
Tenzin says:  I believe you.  I don't know how Amon has achieved this power, but this means the revolution is more dangerous than ever.  No bender is safe.

Shiro Shinobi says:  So much has changed these past three years! Mako is a bodyguard for the future Earth King, Prince Wu, while Bolin works for Kuvira, the Earth Kingdom's interim leader, who has brought stability to a nation plagued by chaos. Meanwhile, after wandering the world trying to heal herself, a spirit led Korra to the swamp, where she met Toph Beifong. Will this earthbending master be the key to Korra regaining her Avatar mojo?
</scene>

<scene>
Wu says:  So then the crowds are gathered, all excited to see my coronation, when all of a sudden, these boulders come rolling through. And guess what pops out of 'em? Earthbender dames! These gals start banging the boulders like drums, and sing the song of my royal lineage.  It's the most dynamite six-hour show you'll ever see in your life. 
Mako says: Shouldn't you be getting ready to,  I don't know ... rule a whole nation?
Wu says:  Now, now, now, don't get yourself in a tizzy.  I'll have ministers for all that!  No, sir, Mako, when we get to Ba Sing Se, it'll just be two kooky pals, living the life! 
Mako says:  Yay ...
</scene>

<scene>
Raiko says: Getting excited for your big day?
Wu says: Does a platypus-bear poop in‒ Hey!  You can't put bleachers there! There won't be enough room for the Dance of the Badgermoles! Look, it's going to go like this. 
Mako says: You sure that's the guy you want running the Earth Kingdom?
</scene>

<scene>
Raiko says: Trust me. We'll be sending a delegation of experienced advisers to handle day-to-day governing.
Tenzin says:  I see the prince is becoming accustomed to the burdens of leadership.
Raiko says: You know royals. They love a ceremony. Have you received any word on the Avatar's location?
Tenzin says:  Not yet, but I have airbenders all over the world on the lookout for her.  I hope they find her soon. I'm concerned about reports I've heard regarding Kuvira's growing military. They say she's throwing some of her dissenters into prison camps.
</scene>

<scene>
Raiko says: Well, she'll be stepping down tomorrow. We can worry about correcting any of her mistakes after that.
Mako says: And you're not worried about her handing power over to Prince Wu?
Raiko says:  When Kuvira started cleaning up the Earth Kingdom, she knew her position wasn't permanent. She gave me her word that she'd step down.
Tenzin says:  Still, I'd feel a lot better if Korra were here.
Korra says: You got to help me get back into Avatar fighting shape.  I'm getting my butt kicked by losers all over the Earth Kingdom. The world needs me.
Toph says:  Get over yourself! The world doesn't need you one bit.
Korra says:  But, while I've been the Avatar, I've stopped some really bad people from doing some really bad things.
Toph says: Listen, when I was Chief of Police in Republic City, I worked my butt off busting criminals. But did that make crime disappear? Nope. If there's one thing I learned on the beat, it's that the names change, but the street stays the same.
Korra says: So, basically, you're saying that everything I've ever accomplished has been pointless.  And I thought Beifong was grumpy.
Toph says:  I'm the original Beifong!
Korra says: So ... you're not going to train me?
Toph says: Well, I was planning on soaking my feet in mud for a few weeks.  But I can't stand you being so pathetic and getting your butt kicked all the time. All right, I guess I can help.
Korra says: Thank you!
Toph says: Na-uh-uh-uh. You want to hug something,  go hug a tree.  We're here to work!

Bolin says: Hello Republic Cit-ay! Bolin ... is back!  And ... Eska is also here.
Eska says:  I see you have replaced me with a new girlfriend.  Well done, she seems very threatening.
Bolin says: Oh no no, that's Kuvira, she's kind of my boss.
Eska says:  Boss, girlfriend. Same thing.
Cam says:  I'm afraid there's been a mistake, Your Eminence. We have you and your brother booked in the same room, with only one bed.
Eska says: It's no mistake. Desna sleeps in the tub.

Varrick says: Never thought I'd be allowed back in the Republic City Four Elements.  Raiko must have turned purple when Kuvira made him pardon me of my alleged crimes.
Zhu Li says: You're an upstanding citizen again, sir.
Varrick says:  Upstanding is right!  And don't forget to fill the extra bag with as many of those little soaps as you can grab.  Love the lavender scent.
Mako says: Bolin!  Look at you! My little brother got all ... important.
Bolin says: I know, right? I see myself in the mirror sometimes and I think I'm in trouble before I realize: it's only me.
Mako says:  So, what's it like working for Kuvira?  From what I've heard, she's pretty harsh.
Bolin says:  No! I—I mean, she can be tough, sure, but we're turning around the Earth Kingdom like you wouldn't believe! You remember how bad Grandma's neighborhood in Ba Sing Se was? All that's completely changed, I mean, we are really ... helping people. But what have you been up to? Fighting crime?  Busting triads? Chasing the ladies,  Mako-style?
Mako says:  Well, I've been working for Wu.  And, uhhh ...  Yeah.
Bolin says: So, have you seen Korra yet?
Mako says: No. She was supposed to come in with Tonraq, but he said she left the South Pole months ago. No one knows where she is.

Baatar Jr. says: Mother.
Suyin says: Hello, Baatar Jr.
Baatar Jr. says: It's just "Baatar" now. So, now that you've seen all the good we've done since we left Zaofu, you must be sorry that you didn't come and help us.
Suyin says: I don't know if I'd call marching all over the Earth Kingdom, forcing people to bow to Kuvira, "doing good".
Baatar Jr. says: You're going to have to get over your grudge with her. I'm sure you've heard that we're engaged. She's going to be an official member of our family.
Suyin says: I'm just glad she'll be stepping down after tomorrow.
Baatar Jr. says: You prefer to be ruled by  that royal idiot?
Wu says: I hope I'm not out of order saying this: You're pretty easy on the eyes for a military type.  I'll put in a good word for you with the hotel staff, maybe get you a little upgrade. I've been living here for years, they love me.
Kuvira says: I won't be needing your help. We've reserved the presidential suite.
Wu says: Well, I think someone is pulling your chain, gumdrop! See, I'm in the presidential suite.
Kuvira says:  Not anymore. I had you moved out.
Wu says:  Wait, what?  Cam, where's all my stuff?
Cam says:  We've moved you into a very nice junior suite on the seventh floor.
Wu says:  Junior suite?
Kuvira says:  Something you should know about me: I always get what I want.

Gun says:  Your royal cabinet is here, your majesty!
Wu says: Where have you been? My coronation is in ten minutes!  Where's everyone else? Where are the Seven Sacred Chests of Exquisite Finery? Where are my grandfather's taffeta pantaloons?
Gun says: Sadly, most of your servants were scattered and the royal things were looted after the queen was  removed from office. So your coronation may not have some of the usual items ... like ... the crown.
Wu says: There's no crown?! How can you have a coronation without a crown?  How will people know when I'm officially the king?
Gun says:  We still have one of the royal jewels we can pin on you.
Wu says:  An earring?
Gun says: Think of it more as a royal brooch. 
Wu says: Are you telling me that there are no dancing badgermoles? No acrobat bell ringers, no horn blowing announcery guy?
Gun says: It will be a very simple, intimate, elegant ceremony. A wonderful day for your kingdom. Just try on the brooch, Your Grace, you will see it looks beautiful ... 
Wu says: Don't ... touch me.
</scene>

<scene>
Toph says: Okay, bring it!
Toph says: Tell me what you did wrong.
Korra says:  Well, I was thinking that you were ...
Toph says:  Exactly! You were thinking!  Go again.
Toph says: Pathetic. Of all the Avatar's I've worked with, you're by far the worst. I know that's only one other Avatar,  but still.
Korra says:  Gah! Hey! It seems like you're enjoying having someone around to beat up an awful lot.
Toph says: Yeah, the swampbenders out here really can't take a punch.
Korra says: So ... what made you want to drop out and disconnect from the rest of the world?
Toph says: I'm more connected to the world than you've ever been! The roots and vines ... they run all over the world. I can see Su and Lin, Zaofu and Republic City. I see everything.  You're blind compared to me.

Gun says: Now rise, Wu of the Hou-Ting Dynasty, King of all the Earth Lands and glorious defender of Ba Sing Se. Long may you reign!
Spectator #1 says:  Go Wu! Woohoo ...
Spectator #2 says:  Woohoo ...
Wu says:  Thank you, for that incredibly brief, but very moving ceremony. I am touched by the love of my devoted countrymen, who have worked so hard to restore their beloved leader to the throne. One of them deserves special attention.  Kuvira, rise!  For your service to the realm, I would like to present you with the Kyoshi Medal of Freedom, our nation's highest honor, which was somehow not stolen, unlike the royal pinky rings.
Kuvira says: Thank you. And if you don't mind, I would like to say a few words.
Wu says: Why not?  We've got six hours to fill ...
Kuvira says:  Growing up in Zaofu, with Suyin Beifong,  I learned that the idea of a royal family passing a title from one generation to the next was archaic, and that technology and innovation should be what drives a nation forward. It was the pathetic rule of kings and queens that caused the Earth Kingdom to descend into such incredible disarray. It's taken me three years to get it back on track, and there is no way I will allow it to slip back into the dark ages.  I'd like to make an announcement to the world: the Earth Kingdom is no more. And from here on out,  this man has no authority. 
Wu says: Wait, what? But I just got the royal brooch!
Kuvira says:  I have created a new Earth Empire, and I will continue to lead it into the future myself, bringing about a new era of prosperity for my people.
Crowd says:  We love you, Kuvira!  All hail the Great Uniter!
Kuvira says: And let me assure my fellow leaders of one thing:  Anyone who crosses our borders or stands in our way, will be crushed. 
Crowd says:  Thank you, Kuvira! All hail the Great Uniter!
Wu says:  Worst coronation ever.
</scene>

<scene>
Bolin says: Were you surprised? Because I was really surprised. Won't this turn all the world leaders against us?
Varrick says:  Relax, kid, what can they do? Kuvira controls the whole nation now, and Republic City is begging for the metal that we're mining. This train has left the station, and we own the track!
Varrick says: Now that's a nice looking hunk of spirit vine! Let's take it back to the lab and get it stabilized immediately.
Kuvira says: You look worried, Bolin.
Bolin says:  Yeah, well, I just have some misgivings about how you kind of ambushed Tenzin and the other leaders.
Kuvira says: You believe in the work that we've done for the people of the Earth Empire, right, Bolin?
Bolin says: I do, but ...
Kuvira says:  Then stick with me. I'm going to need your help now more than ever. Raiko and the other leaders want to bully us into accepting some idiot king who will serve them but neglect the people. We have to stand strong against them.
Bolin says: I'm just not sure about this whole "Empire" thing. It seems pretty aggressive. And what was that part about the crushing?
Kuvira says: That was just some ... tough rhetoric to let people know that we mean business. Believe me,  conflict is the last thing I want. Will you help me make history, Bolin?
Bolin says:  I'll stand by you.
Kuvira says: Thank you.
Suyin says: We need to talk. 
Kuvira says:  Can you give us the room, please? 
Suyin says: I met with the world leaders, and I've come as their representative.
Kuvira says: So now you're taking an interest in world affairs. A little late, isn't it? When the queen fell, and everyone was asking you to help keep the Earth Kingdom from falling apart, all you wanted to do was hide in Zaofu, and let others deal with the consequences.
Suyin says: That's hardly fair. I didn't want to seize power for myself, which is what you've done. I'm telling you for the good of everyone, you have to step down.
Kuvira says: I stepped up. I provide stability and equality. Tell your world leaders to stay out of Earth Empire business. We won't accept their hand-picked dictator.
Suyin says: What makes you so different? You're just another tyrant. And don't pretend the people put you where you are. I know what happens to cities who don't want to hand over control to you.
Kuvira says: Then you know what's coming for Zaofu.
Wu says: First I lose my suite, then I lose my throne. My royal brooch is a lie!  I know you must be crushed, not getting to come back to Ba Sing Se with me.
Mako says:  Don't worry about me. I'll ... find a way to make it.
Wu says: Good ol' Mako, my big tough guy.  Okay. I just have to go on, move forward, take decisive action.  Let's go shopping!
Wu says:  Ugh. Get rid of him. He's with her.
Mako says: He's my brother. 
Bolin says: Interesting ceremony, huh?
Mako says: You aren't going to keep working for Kuvira now that she's going against the wishes of the entire world, are you?
Bolin says: You don't understand. Kuvira is helping out all the poor people of the Earth Empire. People like our family. This is for the best.
Mako says: I don't know, bro.
Bolin says: Okay, why don't you come with me, and you'll see for yourself? We've done a lot of good, and Varrick is working on some new innovations. We're making history.
Mako says: By "crushing" anyone who gets in your way?
Bolin says:  That was just some tough rhetoric to let the people know that we mean business. I mean, Kuvira is basically just like Korra.  She might seem hard to deal with, but just because she's so passionate and believes in what she's doing.
Mako says: It seems like she's just a dictator who's taking the Earth Kingdom by force.
Bolin says:  Oh, okay, you think your new best friend in there  would be a better leader than Kuvira?
Mako says: Well, no, but still ...
Bolin says: Still what? Come on, Mako! I'm making a difference out there, what are you doing, huh? You're just some glorified butler for some snotty rich bozo!
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: I'm sorry, I don't want to work for your glorious emperor and her military dictatorship.
Bolin says:  Fine! I'm going to go back to my awesome train, where we bring freedom where ever we go! Enjoy licking the king's boots in your junior suite! 
Wu says:  Sorry, sport, I heard it all.
Mako says: I can't believe him!
Wu says: I know! Insulting another man's suite? It's beneath low. But I think I know what would cheer you up: a visit to Little Ba Sing Se Fashion Mall! I'll buy you a smoothie.
Mako says:  Yeah. Okay.

Korra says: That was terrible.
Toph says: Hah! Maybe for you. I had a great time! I never realized how much I missed tormenting the Avatar  I wish you were putting up more of a fight, but it was still fun.
Korra says: You were tossing me around like a ragdoll all day long.
Toph says: I know! And I'm an old lady! Imagine me in my prime!  I would have destroyed you!
Korra says: I just don't understand why I can't get back to my former self. It's like ... I'm a step slower. I'm tentative, I'm out of sync, I just can't get back in the groove.
Toph says:  Probably carrying around that metal doesn't help.
Korra says:  What metal?
Toph says: The little bits of metal poison stuck in your body. Are you trying to tell me you can't feel metal in your own body? You really are the worst Avatar ever.
Korra says:  I thought Su got it all out.
Toph says: Oh, my girls never really picked up metalbending all that well, if you ask me.
Korra says:  That's been my problem this entire time! I gotta get it out! You can get it out for me, right?
Toph says: Who do you think you're talking to?

Wu says: Once we're done with these, we can go into the Middle Ring and I'll let you pick out some new suits, then we'll hit the boutiques in the Upper Ring for me.  Where did you get those shirts?
Girl #1 says: Aces, right? Kuvira is my hero.
Girl #2 says: They're selling them over there.
Wu says:  You can't sell that junk in here! This is the Little Ba Sing Se Fashion Mall, and I'm the Little King here! Respect the brooch!
Crowd says:  Stop it, Little King!
Wu says:  I am the Glorious Defender!
Crowd says:  I'm covered in juice! Get him!
Mako says: We need to get you out of here.
Wu says:  It's destiny. Look where we are, Mako! The Royal Palace.
Little Boy says: Hey! It's my birthday!
Wu says:  It's my coronation day! You'll have another birthday next year, but I'll never have this day back again! Never! 
Mako says: Okay, you're losing it.
Wu says:  This is the worst day of my life!
Mako says: Why? Do you really want to be the king? I mean, Kuvira might be a power-crazed dictator, but at least she spent the last few years working hard to make the Earth Kingdom somewhat better. If you were an Earth Kingdom citizen, do you think you're the kind of person you want as your king? What have you ever done for your people?  I'm sorry, that was out of line.
Wu says: No, you're right. No one ever talked to me like that before. I guess I'm just a joke who got what he deserved.
Mako says:  Let's get you out of here and back to someplace safe.
Wu says: Carry me?
Mako says:  No.

Toph says: Okay, if you want me to bend out this metal, you need to relax.
Korra says:  I am relaxed.
Toph says:  Seriously? Your body is like a twisted tree-trunk!
Korra says: Just do it! I'm ready.
Toph says: It wouldn't hurt if you would just relax! Stop fighting me!
Korra says: I'm not fighting!
Toph says:  All right, that's it. You're going to have to do this yourself. Clearly, you want to keep the metal in there.
Korra says: What do you mean? Why would I want poison inside me?
Toph says: I don't know! Maybe so you have an excuse not to go back to being the Avatar. If you don't get better, you can't do your job, so you don't have to worry about getting hurt again!
Korra says: Wha‒ That's ridiculous!
Toph says: Whatever. When you want it out, you can bend it out. I can't deal with all your issues for you.
Korra says: Wait! What am I supposed to do now?
Toph says: How should I know? Ask the spirit that brought you here. The good news is, if you're looking for a place to hang where no one will bother you, you picked the best swamp in the world!

Shiro Shinobi says:  Tensions between the Northern and Southern Water Tribes have reached a breaking point. After Chief Unalaq's troops took over the South, Varrick incited an uprising. But Korra stopped the rebels from abducting her uncle. Enraged by the insurrection, Unalaq arrested the rebels and Korra's parents, accusing them of conspiring to assassinate him. Will Korra be able to save her parents and prevent civil war?
Korra says:  You're making a mistake. 
Unalaq says: I wish it hadn't come to this. But your parents held meeting with the rebels, right here in their home.
Korra says:  I can't believe you're doing this to your own family.
Unalaq says: Rest assured, I've appointed Judge Hotah to oversee the trial. He is the most fair and honorable man I know.
Korra says: Uncle, my parents had nothing to do with the men who attacked you.
Unalaq says: I'm sure you're right. So we should have nothing to worry about.
Korra says:  I hope so.

Asami says: Where's Varrick? We should've closed our deal an hour ago.
Bolin says:  Would you relax? This place is great.  And the best part about it,  Eska doesn't know I'm here. 
Bolin says:  Ee-yah.  I wasn't hiding. Hey, hey-hey, hey.
Eska says: I'm not on the hunt for you.  Currently.
Desna says: We search for Varrick. Our father wishes him to stand trial.
Asami says: What did he do?
Eska says: He is a traitor to the Water Tribe, along with our aunt and uncle.
Asami says: What?
Mako says: Korra's parents were arrested?
Desna says: Yes. Your powers of deduction are impressive.
Bolin says:  Yeah, he's a cop.
Northern guardsman says:  Varrick's not here.
Eska says: Very well. Desna, let us continue our search elsewhere.  Boyfriend! Bow to me when I exit.
Bolin says:  Yes, yes, my sweet koala otter.
Eska says: You are so cute when you grovel.
Asami says:  Don't let her treat you that way. Stand up for yourself.
Bolin says: I tried to break up with her, but Mako gave me terrible advice. Thank you, Mako. 
Mako says: Wait, how are your girl problems my fault?
Asami says: Bolin, you need to be honest with her. Tell her how you really feel.
Varrick says:  Honesty is for fools, kid. 
Bolin says: Varrick?
Varrick says:  If you want to ditch this girl, then make yourself scarce. Disappear, like I did.
Asami says:  Where are you?
Varrick says:  Somewhere Unalaq will never find me.  Inside Ping-Ping! How we doin'?
Mako says: The coast is clear. You can come out.
Varrick says: No way, mister. Not until I know it's absolutely 157% safe.  Ah! Thank you, Zhu Li.
Asami says: Your assistant's in there too?
Varrick says:  Zhu Li never leaves my side.  Yuck! Pyugh! Pyuck! You forgot the honey! 
Zhu Li says:  Sorry, sir. There isn't any in here. 
Varrick says: No honey? We're in a bear for crying out loud!
Mako says:  I'm gonna go see how Korra's doing. 
Varrick says: Bolin, I got a little something for you 'round back. 
Bolin says:  Wow!
Varrick says: Now listen up. Unalaq's rigged this trial, no doubt about it. So I need you to make sure my trusty rebels stay out of prison.
Bolin says:  What's the money for?
Varrick says:  Bribery, of course! There's always someone willing to look the other way for a few yuans.
Bolin says: I think I catch your drift, Varrick-bear.

Tenzin says: Ikki! Ikki, where are you? Shoo!  Go bother someone else. You two are worse than Kya and Bumi.
Ikki says: Okay, everybody here?
Tenzin says: Ikki! Oh, thank goodness.
Ikki says:  Juniper Lightning bug, paws off the table!  This is going to be a civilized breakfast. Daddy always says a blessing before we eat, so ...  be quiet and listen up!  We are thankful for this super yummy food and for being the best-est new friends in the world.  But we are most thankful because Meelo and Jinora aren't here,  because they stink.  Oh! Hi, Daddy. I guess you found me. Do I have to go now?
Tenzin says: Actually, is there room for one more?
Ikki says: Uh, sure. You can sit next to Blueberry Spicehead.
Tenzin says:  Nice to meet you, Blueberry Spicehead.
Ikki says: And that's Princess Rainbow, and that's Twinkle Starchild, and that's Juniper Lightning Bug. They're my new brothers and sisters.
Tenzin says: New ones, huh? Can they be my new brothers and sisters too?
Ikki says: Maybe, but only if they say it's okay.  Uh-huh, uh-huh. No, no, he's nice. They say it's okay.

Law clerk says: This trial will now come to order! Judge Hotah presiding. 
Bolin says:  Man! I should have paid him!
Asami says:  Yeah, you think? 
Unalaq says: I was asleep in my chambers when the rebels attacked. They overpowered me, and the next thing I remember was waking up in the snow after Avatar Korra had saved me.
Hotah says: According to Unalaq's testimony, you attended a meeting where Varrick tried to incite a civil war. Is that true?
Korra says: Yes.
Hotah says: And where these men present at that meeting?
Korra says: Well, yes, but -
Hotah says: And where exactly did this meeting take place?
Bolin says: Objection!
Hotah says: Quiet down out there! I'll ask you one more time. Where did the meeting happen?
Korra says: My parents' house.
Hotah says: And who led this meeting?
Bolin says: Your honor, if I may?
Hotah says: May what?
Bolin says: May I ... declare a mistrial?
Hotah says:  Sit down!  Varrick and your father led the meeting, didn't they?
Korra says:  My parents are innocent!
Hotah says: I've heard all I need to. I'll return shortly with my decision.

Bolin says: Hey there, Eska, I was wondering if we could talk.
Eska says: I grant you permission to speak freely.
Bolin says:  Oh, good, because I just need to be honest with you. You know, when we first met, there was this crazy spark. But I'm starting to feel like that spark is fading.
Eska says: I agree. It is as if a great chasm has formed between us and nothing can bridge it.
Bolin says:  Oh! Oh, yes! I'm so glad you understand!
Eska says: Nothing, that is, except marriage.  We will wed at sunset. You may express your joy through tears.
Bolin says:  Oh, no, I can't -  This is really tight.

Unalaq says: Korra, calm down. I'll talk to him.  I know I promised to respect whatever decision you made, but I must ask you to reconsider. Show these men and my brother mercy.
Hotah says: Very well. I'll change their punishment. Your lives will be spared, but you will live them out in prison. 
Korra says: Thank you, Uncle.

Tenzin says: You like that, don't you, Blueberry Spicehead?  Yes, you do.  You know, I could get used to it here. No one's yelling at me or telling me I'm delusional.
Ikki says: We should have Uncle Bumi and Aunt Kya come visit. I bet they'd like it too.
Tenzin says: Let's not. They'll only spoil our good mood.
Ikki says: What do you mean? Aunt Kya is super nice and pretty and always asks me how I'm feeling, and Uncle Bumi is, like, the funniest person in the world.
Tenzin says: But what about Meelo? He's hilarious too, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth. And Jinora can be so sweet and gentle.
Ikki says:  And mean. And bossy.  Being part of a family is hard, huh, Daddy?
Tenzin says: I couldn't agree with you more.
Ikki says: But, I guess the nice part about a family is they'll always be there for you. Even though  Twinkle Starchild and Princess Rainbow fight, they still love each other.
Tenzin says: That's very wise of you, Ikki.
Ikki says: We should probably head back, huh?
Tenzin says: I suppose. We can't hide in this cave forever. 
Ikki says: Don't worry, Daddy. We'll come back and visit Blueberry Spicehead. I know you really bonded with her.
Tenzin says: Yes, I'd like that.

Korra says:  It's not about what I want. It's about what Naga wants.  And she'd like you to let my father out of prison.
Hotah says: I-I'm sorry, but there is nothing I can do. I was just following Unalaq's orders.
Korra says:  What are you talking about?
Hotah says: I-I've said too much.
Korra says:  Unless you wanna be Naga's afternoon snack, you'd better keep talking.
Hotah says: I-I've worked for your uncle for years! He said he needed everyone to think the trial was fair.
Korra says: So Unalaq told you what to say?
Hotah says: Yes! Every word.
Korra says: Then why did he have you free my mother and change your sentence?
Hotah says: He's trying to keep you on his side. But he also wants your father out of the way. Just like when he got your father banished.
Korra says:  What do you mean, "he got my father banished"?
Hotah says: Nothing!
Korra says:  Keep talking.

Korra says: Unalaq's a liar and a traitor!
Varrick says: I've been trying to tell you that from the get-go.
Mako says: What happened?
Korra says: I found out the truth about my dad's banishment. Unalaq hired the barbarians to attack their tribe. Then he told them to hide in the spirit forest, knowing my dad would go after them.
Mako says: Unalaq wanted your dad out of the way so he could become chief. It was a setup.
Korra says: Just like the whole trial. I can't believe I trusted him. I'm busting my father and the rebels out of jail. I need your help.
Mako says: If you do this, there's no going back.
Korra says: I know. Will you help me or not?
Mako says: Of course, I'll help.
Asami says: Me too.
Varrick says:  Count me in!
Mako says: I don't even want to know.
Asami says: So I'm guessing the breakup with Eska didn't go well?
Bolin says:  No, no, the honesty thing worked out great. So great she decided we should  get married!
Asami says: Sorry.
Korra says:  I'm pretty sure the guy is supposed to give the girl the betrothal necklace.
Bolin says: I guess Eska didn't get the memo.
Varrick says: Look, the only way to deal with crazy women is to lie big and leave fast. Lucky for you, Varrick's got your back. Now, gather 'round Ping-Ping. Let's talk plan.

Korra says: My dad's in there.  Where is he?
Unalaq says: I'm sorry, Korra. You'll never see your father again.
Korra says: Where's my father?
Unalaq says: On a ship headed to the Northern Tribe. He'll serve out his sentence there.
Korra says: Bring him back. Or I'm taking you out and the rest of your army.
Unalaq says: Remember who you are. As the Avatar, you cannot threaten war. You must remain neutral, or our tribes will never find unity.
Korra says: You don't want unity. You want power. You've always been jealous of my father, haven't you? You got him banished so you could become chief, and I bet it just killed you to learn he was the Avatar's father. No wonder you kept trying to take me away from him.
Unalaq says: All I've ever wanted is to help you realize your destiny.
Korra says: Well, I don't want your help anymore.
Unalaq says: If you start a war, the dark spirits will annihilate the South. And even I will be powerless to stop them.
Korra says: I'm done being manipulated by you. You're going to bring my father back, then you and your troops will return to the North. 
Unalaq says: And why would I do that?
Korra says: Because you still need me to open the Northern portal.
Unalaq says: No, I don't. You've served your purpose.
Mako says: If we get to Varrick's boat, we can still save your father.
Korra says: Let's go.

Varrick says: In case the boat sinks, of course.
Asami says: But there's no runway. How are we supposed to take off?

Bumi says: Yeah, you didn't deserve that.

Rebel leader says: You have our support, Chief Tonraq. 
Korra says:  Mine too. I'll be proud to fight alongside you, Dad.
Tonraq says: No, Korra.
Korra says:  But you said the South doesn't stand a change against Unalaq's forces. I can help. 
Tonraq says: The best way for you to help is by getting the president of the United Republic on our side. The South can give Unalaq a good fight for a while. But we'll need the United Forces in order to win this war.
Korra says:  All right, I'll get you all the help you need. I love you, Dad.

Shiro Shinobi says:  Avatar Korra has lost her memory! In order to restore it, she has connected with Wan, who would become the very first Avatar. Banished from his home, Wan survived for two years in the Spirit Wilds and learned to master fire. But then, Wan split the spirits of light and dark, Raava and Vaatu, unwittingly plunging the world toward annihilation. Will he be able to stop him?
Karu says:  Should we pull her up?
Shaman says:  No. She is connecting with her deepest Avatar memories.  She must confront her own past if she is to move forward.  We can only hope that she survives her ordeal.
Raava says:  The human and spirit realms are headed toward annihilation.  And it's all your fault.  This is why humans have no place  interfering in the business of spirits.
Wan says:  This world is home to all of us, and what happens here is everyone's business.
Raava says:  Thanks to you, this world may cease to exist! I only hope I can track down Vaatu before it's too late.
Wan says:  Let me help you.
Raava says:  I don't want your help.  Don't interfere with me again, human!

Wan says: Let's get moving.

Wan says:  Do you see that, Mula?  People. And they have some kind of wind power.  More humans!  I found you.  Wait! I'm friendly!
Wan says: The legends are true. Another lion turtle city. And it's flying.  I have got to get over there.  There. Okay, Mula. Wish me luck.  Oh, no--.  Wow.  Hi, how are you? I'm Wan.  Um, sorry to interrupt, but it's been a while since I've seen other humans.
Nomad says: Where did you come from, stranger?
Wan says:  Another lion turtle city far away. For the past two years I've been living among the spirits and exploring the wilds.
Nomad says:  Remarkable. Come. Sit with us. We would love to hear of your travels.
Wan says: Vaatu.
Vaatu says: So, we meet again, human.
Nomad says: Why is the great spirit of the darkness here but not his other half? 
Wan says: Uh, I'll explain later.  Leave these people in peace. They've done nothing to harm you. 
Raava says:  Be gone.
Vaatu says: How are you feeling since our split, Raava? I've never been better. When Harmonic Convergence comes, I will destroy you forever. 
Raava says:  I told you not to interfere.
Wan says: I had to do something. These people were in danger.
Nomad says: Great spirit of light, we thank you for your help. But how did you become split from Vaatu? 
Raava says: Ask him. 
Wan says: It wasn't my fault. Vaatu tricked me into freeing him. I'd take it all back if I could.
Raava says: It's too late for that. Now that Vaatu is free, he is turning other spirits dark. The more spirits he turns, the stronger he becomes.
Wan says: He's getting bigger, and you're getting smaller.
Raava says: As darkness grows, light fades. 
Wan says: I'm sorry for endangering your village, but I promise to set things right.
Nomad says:  How?
</scene>

<scene>
Wan says: Great lion turtle, I ask that you grant me the power of air so that I can defeat Vaatu before it's too late. 
Air lion turtle says: You already carry the power of fire. No human has ever held two elements at the same time.
Wan says: I'm not like other humans. I can learn to do it.
Air lion turtle says: Hmm, perhaps. But to do so, Raava must hold the power for you until you master it.
Raava says: Ancient one, why would I do that for a human? Especially one who's caused so much trouble?
Wan says: Raava, please, I can't let the world fall into chaos because of my mistake. Neither of us can defeat Vaatu alone, but together we have a chance.
Raava says: You may be right. Very well. I will help you to master the power of air.
Wan says:  Thank you. And in return I will help you restore balance to the world.
</scene>

<scene>
Wan says: What's this harmonic thing Vaatu was talking about?
Raava says: Harmonic Convergence. That is when Vaatu and I must battle for the fate of the world.
Wan says: How long do we have until then?
Raava says: About a year in your time.
Wan says: Then we better start training.  All right, I'm ready to try air. How's this gonna work?
Raava says: The only way for me to give you the other element is to pass through your body and combine our energies.
Wan says: Great. So you've done this before.
Raava says: No. This has never even been attempted. It is very dangerous.
Wan says: That's what they said about living in the Spirit Wilds, and I survived that. I'm ready. Give me the air.  It feels completely different. If you and Vaatu have the same fight every ten thousand years, why hasn't one of you destroyed the other? 
Raava says: He cannot destroy light any more than I can destroy darkness. One cannot exist without the other. Even if I defeat Vaatu in this encounter, darkness will grow inside me until he emerges again. The same will hold true if Vaatu defeats me.
Wan says: That doesn't sound so bad. Even if Vaatu wins, you'll come back.
Raava says: Yes, but you will probably not survive to see it. Vaatu will destroy the world as you know it. Darkness will cover the Earth for ten thousand years. 
Wan says:  If I'm gonna help you battle Vaatu, then I should visit more lion turtles.  Why is there so much conflict between humans and spirits in the first place?
Raava says:  This physical world is where humans come from. Spirits come from another realm. At the north and south poles, the two realms intersect. Over time, more and more spirits have drifted into this world.  Humans have been forced apart, settling on the lion turtles who protect them and losing touch with each other.
Wan says:  Most people think they live in the only human city in the world.
Raava says:  Most humans think only of themselves,  no matter how many others are around.
Wan says: When you pass through me, I feel an incredible rush of power.  I feel like I'm changing. The more we practice, the stronger I become.  Smells like smoke.
Raava says: Humans are nearby.
Wan says: Let's check it out.
Settler says: A spirit! 
Wan says:  Easy there, fellas. We're friendly.
Jaya says:  I can't believe it. Wan? 
Wan says: Jaya!  What are you doing out here? 
Jaya says:  You inspired us. Once we heard that you survived out in the wilds, we decided to try it too.
Wan says:  Where's Yao?  Did he come with you?
Jaya says:  Yes, but sadly he didn't make it.  We ... we lost a lot of good men along the way.  So why were you protecting this spirit?
Wan says: This is Raava. Don't worry. She's not like the dark spirits you've probably run into.
Jaya says:  Dark spirits? What's the difference? We throw fire at any spirit we see around here. Just like they attack any man.
Raava says:  You have no idea what you're doing. You're only making things worse.
Settler says:  The spirits are coming back! 
Jaya says:  Let's wipe 'em out this time!  We'll burn down this whole forest if we have to!
Wan says: What happened to you? When did you become so violent?
Jaya says:  You showed me we could change the world if we just stopped being so afraid. Now we're doing it. 
Wan says: This isn't what I had in mind.

Aye-aye spirit says: You and Raava are just in time to help us clear these tree-killing fire-lovers out of here just like the old days.
Jaya says: You are the one who's getting cleared out.
Wan says: There's no need for violence. I know there must be a way to work out a compromise.
Aye-aye spirit says: You have a good heart, Stinky. But these fire tossers aren't like you.
Jaya says: Spirits like him killed our friends! I can't let them get away with that.

Dark aye-aye spirit says:  We are protectors of the forest. We won't let you burn it down.
Raava says: It's Vaatu. He's growing stronger, using their anger to turn them to his side.
Dark aye-aye spirit says:  Wipe them out!
Wan says: Stop, please!  Raava, we need to combine our energies. Maybe then we'll have enough power to stop this.  Enough!  You need to stop fighting now,  before you destroy each other!
Aye-aye spirit says:  Stinky, w-what happened?
Jaya says:  He's controlling all four elements.
Raava says:  Wan, I have to leave your body, or I'll destroy you.
Wan says: No. It's working. If you leave, the fighting will start again.
Raava says: Wan!
Wan says: We have to go back.
Vaatu says:  Don't bother. Your human friends have already been annihilated.
Wan says:  No!
Vaatu says: Enjoy your final days. See you at the end of the world!
Wan says: Raava ...
Raava says: I'm sorry, Wan.
Raava says: We're almost there.  I was wrong about you, Wan. I had no idea that humans were capable of such nobility and courage. I'm sorry that we do not have much more time together.
Wan says: Let's not give up before the battle's even begun. Who knows what will happen?  After all, this is my first Harmonic Convergence.
Raava says: This is the southern portal to the Spirit World. Here, Vaatu and I will do battle once again, at the place where the two worlds meet.
</scene>

<scene>
Vaatu says: Are you ready for our final battle, Raava? Thanks to our friend separating us, I think this time I may be rid of you once and for all.
Wan says: Before you get to her, you'll have to go through me.
Vaatu says:  No human can stand against me.
Wan says: Haven't you heard the legends? I'm not a regular human anymore.
Vaatu says: I lived ten thousand lifetimes before the first of your kind crawled out of the mud!
Vaatu says: It was I who broke through the divide that separated the plane of spirits from the material world!  To hate me is to give me breath. To fight me is to give me strength. Now prepare to face oblivion!
Wan says:  Raava! The only way to win is together.  Ah!
Raava says: I have to leave you. If I stay any longer, you will die.
Wan says: It doesn't matter. If you leave me now, Vaatu will destroy everything. We have to finish this together!
Vaatu says: The Harmonic Convergence is about to begin. The era of Raava is over.
</scene>

<scene>
Raava says: We are bonded forever.
Wan says: This is your prison now. And I will close the portals so no human will ever be able to physically enter the Spirit World and release you.
Wan says:  The spirits must stop fighting with humans and return to their home in the Spirit World. I will teach men to respect the spirits so that balance will be maintained.
Wan says:  I will be the bridge between our two worlds. 
Fire lion turtle says:  The world is entering a new age. Our time protecting mankind is over. We will no longer give humans the power of the elements.
Wan says:  Different groups of people must learn to live together.  This is my mission: to use Raava's light spirit  to guide the world toward peace.
</scene>

<scene>
Old Wan says:  I'm sorry, Raava. I failed to bring peace. Even with Vaatu locked away, darkness still surrounds humanity.  There wasn't enough time.
Raava says: Don't worry. We will be together for all of your lifetimes. And we will never give up.

Korra says: Thank you for all your kindness. I wonder how long I've been away.

Meanwhile, Lord Zuko is hot on the trail of three escaped criminals who pose a great threat to the Avatar. Unaware of the danger to her, Korra continues her mission to find more airbenders. Next stop, the walled city of Ba Sing Se.

Bumi says:  Don't worry about me, little lady. I've been in a scrap or two you know. Ha ha.  Oh, you're just a youngster, so I'm gonna go easy on ya.  Wouldn't want to hurt a kid ...
Bumi says:  Oh.
Jinora says: Uncle Bumi, you've got to work on your stance changes.  Kai, that was just, really good.
Kai says:  Thanks Jinora, you're a great teacher.
Bumi says:  Hmm, did I drop my wallet?
Bumi says:  Give me that, you little thief!
Korra says:  It's so exciting to be on a diplomatic mission to Ba Sing Se. What's the Earth Queen like?
Tenzin says: I've never met her, but I've heard she can be quite ... demanding.
Bolin says:  This is it, Mako! We made it! This is where Dad grew up! Come here! Look, look!
Mako says:  Okay, calm down, I'm looking.
Korra says: I wonder how many airbenders are down there.

Korra says: Uhh, the Lower Ring looks terrible.
Bolin says:  Yeah, I can smell it from here. No wonder Dad left.

Gun says:  Avatar Korra, Master Tenzin, it is a pleasure to welcome you and your party to the Upper Ring of Ba Sing Se. I'm Grand Secretariat Gun.
Korra says:  Thank you.
Bolin says: Aah, it's got that Upper Ring smell.
Gun says:  Oh no, the queen hates animals.  You'll have to get them out of sight.
Bolin says:  Well, I can just stash Pabu in my shirt,  these two are going to be a little tougher.
Gun says:  Come with me, hurry, I'll take you to your quarters.
</scene>

<scene>
Gun says: Now, when you meet the queen make sure you bow low enough, that's very important, and don't look her in the eye, she can't stand that. If any food is served, don't eat before she eats. Well actually, I have to taste her food first, then she eats, then you can eat. Better yet, just don't eat.
Korra says: Seems like an awful lot of rules.
Gun says:  Oh, you have no idea. And I'm the one who gets in trouble when people don't follow them, so please, please for my sake try not to upset Her Majesty.

Gun says:  Here we are.
Bolin says:  Ooh, very swanky.

Hou-Ting says:  You're ruining the koi pond! It's completely overshadowed by the topiaries! Guards, take that buffoon away and get me someone who knows what they're doing!
Hou-Ting says:  You, rip everything out and start over!
Hou-Ting says: I am surrounded by idiots.  So, I finally get a visit from the Avatar. Let me guess, you want something.
Korra says: Well, actually Your Majesty, I was hoping you could ...
Hou-Ting says:  I hardly think you're in a position to ask me for favors after everything the last Avatar did to the Earth Kingdom.  He and Fire Lord Zuko took advantage of my father's weakness and stole our lands to make their own little empire.  The United Republic is Earth Kingdom territory!
Korra says:  Well, I uh, I'm not sure what I can do about that.
Hou-Ting says: Not that you care, but what's left of my kingdom is falling to ruin. Roving bands of barbarians are raiding villages in the countryside. And now, some of my subjects are refusing to pay their taxes. 
Korra says: I'm very sorry for your troubles, but actually ...
Hou-Ting says:  That topiary is supposed to be an eel swan  not a turtle duck!

Tenzin says:  Kai?
Bolin says:  Kai, little bro.
Bumi says:  He's not over here.
Asami says: I don't think I've seen him since we landed.
Mako says: I knew that kid was no good. He was just waiting for an opportunity to run away again.
Jinora says: We have to find him.
Mako says: What's the point? He obviously doesn't care about us.
Bolin says: But he's my new little brother. He's probably lost, and scared.
Tenzin says: He is just a little boy, and he's our responsibility. Besides, he's the only airbender we've recruited so far, we can't lose him.
Mako says: Fine. Bolin and I will find him.
</scene>

<scene>
Hou-Ting says: No, to your left! Your other left!  Do you have these problems with your servants?
Korra says: I don't really have servants. But, Your Majesty, the reason for our visit is that we're trying to gather all of the new airbenders who are popping up in the Earth Kingdom, and we'd like your help finding the ones in Ba Sing Se.
Hou-Ting says:  Airbenders in Ba Sing Se. Where did you hear that?
Korra says: Before we left Republic City we got some reports.
Hou-Ting says: Hmm. Well, before I even consider helping you, I'll need you to do something for me.
Korra says: Oh, of course. What is it?
Hou-Ting says: I have a vault full of tax money sitting in a town south of here. Barbarians have stolen my past two shipments. Go collect my money and bring it back here.
Korra says:  Yes, Your Majesty.

Upper-class man says: Thanks for your help.

Korra says: There are royal guards waiting at the vault.  I doubt anything will happen. I think Her Majesty likes ordering me around.

Bolin says: Ohh man, aww I slipped a disc sleeping here. It's been awhile since we spent the night in a trash pile. It's about how I remembered.
Mako says: I bet everyone's freaking out that we've been gone all night. 
Bolin says: I'm worried about Kai; he's just a little kid out there on his own. He's probably really scared.

Waiter says: Your breakfast, Master Fong.
Kai says:  Keep the change.  I love Ba Sing Se.

Bolin says: Fwoo, I'm getting really hungry.  Haah, we might have to hustle up a little breakfast with the old,  fruit stand scam. Come on.  You remember how it goes,  I push you into the stand,  you scream.  I pretend to faint.
Mako says: I don't want any part of it. Besides, look at this fruit,  it's disgusting. We don't want to steal this.
Tu says:  Hey,  you trying to steal my fruit?
Mako says: No, I just said I don't want any of this rotten fruit.
Tu says:  Oh, you're too good for my fruit?  This is the best fruit on the block.
Mako says: So you want me to steal it?
Tu says:  Just try me, buddy.  Go ahead.
Bolin says: I'm confused. Are we stealing the fruit or not?
Tu says: I knew it.  Thieves! 
Chow says: What's going on here?
Tu says:  Dad, these fruit thieves are insulting our fruit.
Chow says:  Bolin? Mako?
Mako says: How do you know our names?
Bolin says: Yeah, I mean I'm famous so I get that, but how do you know his name?
Chow says: You look just like San.  Tu, you'll never believe who these guys are. They're your cousins! My brother San's kids.

Desna says: Lord Zuko, Uncle, this is a surprise.
Eska says: Finally something exciting happens. Ruling the tribe is so tedious.
Zuko says: Then you should enjoy this. We need to check on a secret ice prison in the western tundra.

Chow says: Your father sent us a letter years ago with your names, but that was the last we heard from him. Then we saw your pictures in the sports magazine with your bending team, and Bolin, we love those Nuktuk movers. They're hilarious!
Bolin says: Yeah, they're not really comedies, but uh ...
Tu says: Yeah, I could probably be a pro-bender or an actor or something if I lived in a mansion in Republic City like you guys. You don't know what it's like on the streets. You got to be tough. 
Bolin says: Oh, Mako and I grew up on the streets. We were homeless, then we were kinda in a gang, then we lived in a gym ... 
Chow says: Hey everybody! Look who's here, San's kids: Mako and Bolin. 
Male family member says: No way.
Female family member says: Come in.
Male family member #2 says: Welcome.
Yin says: Is it true? After all these years?
Chow says: Boys, this is your grandmother, Yin.
Yin says: Aw, it is so wonderful to meet my long lost grandchildren  Where is San and your mother?
Bolin says: Wait, you mean you don't know?
Mako says: I'm sorry, they were killed when we were little.

Korra says: I don't like the looks of this. Let's hurry up and get out of here.
Royal Earth Kingdom guard says: You here to pick up the tax shipment?
Korra says: Go ahead and load it on the airship.

Asami says: So much for our escorts.
Korra says:  Maybe we should have brought everybody else.
Barbarians says: Woo hoo!
Gombo says: Step away from the gold ladies and you won't get hurt.
Korra says: Sorry to disappoint you, but we're taking this gold back to Ba Sing Se.
Gombo says: Aww, we love gals with spirit, suit yourself.
Gombo says: Retreat, retreat!  You're on the wrong side of this fight, Avatar. That gold belongs to the people, not the Queen.
Korra says:  Why do I get the feeling he's right?
</scene>

<scene>
Eska says: Why didn't anyone tell us we have a secret prison we could have been throwing people in?
Desna says: I'd like to put my tailor in here. He never gets my cuffs right. They're so ... crease-y.
Zuko says: We built this place secretly with your father to hold a very special prisoner. She's a powerful firebender named P'Li who can create explosions with her mind. Ironically, I hired a guy with a similar ability to kill the Avatar myself once.  Didn't work.
Eska says:  Don't feel bad. I tried to kill Korra  after she ruined my wedding. It happens.
Tonraq says:  Let's just focus on keeping this woman in prison.
</scene>

<scene>
Zuko says: The intense cold prevents her from firebending.
Desna says:  There's certainly no way anyone's breaking out of here.
Zuko says: That's what we thought about the other three prisons.
P'Li says:  There must be something exciting going on . No one interesting has visited me in thirteen years.
Tonraq says: Don't get used to it.
P'Li says: He's out, isn't he? Mmm, I'm feeling warmer already .

Bolin says: This is so great! We never had a family before. Now we've got one, two, five ... eleven ...  ... a big family! Yeah!
Mako says: So why did Dad leave Ba Sing Se?
Chow says: Oh, he always had big dreams. He couldn't wait to get out and see the world. Your grandfather thought it was ridiculous. He wanted San to stay home and work the fruit stand. But San was determined to leave, and they had a huge fight.  And that was the last time they ever spoke.  Oh, um ... sorry, Mom.
Yin says:  Come with me. I have something to show you.
</scene>

<scene>
Yin says:  This is the only letter we ever got from San. It says he married a beautiful girl from the Fire Nation, and had two wonderful sons. He sent this picture of you all on his birthday. 
Bolin says: Look, Mako! Dad's wearing your scarf!
Yin says: I'm so sad that I never got to meet your mother,  but you have her eyes. I know from looking at you two that she must have been a wonderful bride for my boy. 
Mako says:  I'm sure they would want you to have this.

Gun says: Your Majesty. The Avatar has returned with the tax payments.
Hou-Ting says: Finally. Secure it in the vault.
Gun says: It's being done as we speak.
Korra says: So now, Your Majesty, if I could start meeting some of the airbenders here in the city.
Hou-Ting says: The Dai Li thoroughly searched the city, but it seems your reports were incorrect. There are no airbenders in Ba Sing Se. So, you can gather your little band and be on your way tomorrow.
Korra says: You make me do your dirty work extorting your own citizens for your stupid palaces and topiaries and then you just want to send me away? We're not going anywhere until we find some airbenders! We know there are some here!
Hou-Ting says:  Get her out of my sight!
Korra says:  This isn't over! I'm going to find the airbenders!
</scene>

<scene>
Chow says:  You know, San would've been so proud of you guys! Traveling the world with the Avatar? He would've loved that!
Mako says: We actually need to get back to the Avatar in the Upper Ring. We're supposed to be helping her find airbenders in Ba Sing Se. 
Bolin says:  What? What happened?
Chow says: One of our neighbors started airbending about a week ago. A couple days later, two Dai Li agents come out of nowhere and snatch him up. No one's seen him since.
Tu says: They say the Earth Queen's locking all the airbenders up somewhere, and using them for experiments.
Yin says: Tu! Don't talk like that about Her Majesty!  Long may she reign.
Mako says:  We have to get back to the Upper Ring and tell Korra. 
Bolin says:  I hope Kai is okay.

Tarrlok says:  Although the Hundred Year War has long passed, we are not living in a time of peace.  These revolutionaries who call themselves "Equalists" are not interested in equality at all. They just want to wage war against benders.  Chief Beifong was supposed to protect Republic City, but she was powerless to stop Amon's attack on the arena. She has failed us all. If we are to survive these dire times, our law enforcement needs new leadership.
Mako says: I still can't believe they're shutting this place down.
Bolin says:  Yeah. We had some good memories here, didn't we?
Korra says:  Guys! Great news. You don't have to go back on the streets. I talked to Tenzin and made all the arrangements. You can come live on Air Temple Island with me!
Mako says: Oh, we'd love to, but ...
Bolin says:  Asami already invited us to live in her dad's giant mansion!  From here on out, it's gonna be the lap of luxury for us.
Asami says:  Oh hey, Korra, I was hoping you would stop by. 
Korra says: I was just leaving.  So, I guess I'll see you guys around, some time.
Asami says: Why not tomorrow? I'd love to have you come visit the estate.
Korra says: I don't know. I have some ... Avatar stuff to do.
Bolin says:  Come on, Korra.  We all deserve a little rest and relaxation after all this craziness. We could swim in Asami's pool.  It'll be fun!
Korra says:  All right, Pabu.

Lin says: Mr. Sato, if you remember anything else about what you saw during Amon's attack, be sure to let us know.
Hiroshi Sato says: I'm happy to help any way I can. I want these Equalists to pay for what they've done.

Bolin says:  Ooh, Ooh! I vote makeovers! 
Asami says:  I had something a little more exciting in mind.

Asami says: Pretty cool, huh?
Korra says:  Way cooler than a makeover.
Asami says: This is where Future Industries test-drives their Satomobiles. Ever been behind the wheel?
Korra says: The only thing I know how to drive is a polar bear dog.
Asami says: You want me to take you for a spin?
Korra says:  Let's do it!
Korra says:  That was amazing! I didn't think we'd make it.
Asami says: Well, you can't be afraid to mix it up sometimes.
Korra says: I gotta admit, I had you pegged wrong. I thought you were kind of ... prissy.  Eh-No offense!
Asami says:  It's all right, people usually assume that I'm daddy's helpless little girl, but I can handle myself. I mean, I've been in self-defense classes since I was this high.  My dad made sure that I would always be able to protect myself.
Korra says: Smart guy.

Korra says:  Uh, sorry! I forgot, I'm supposed to airsit, I mean babybend, I-I mean babysit the airbender kids. See you later!
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says: So, you think Mr. Sato manufactured those gloves for the Equalists then framed Cabbage Corp?
Lin says: That's a bold accusation, but what proof do you have?
Korra says: Well, I don't exactly have proof, but I know what I heard. Sato's up to something.
Lin says: He does have the means ... and he has a motive.
Tenzin says: That's right.
Korra says:  A motive? What is it?
Tenzin says: Twelve years ago, the Agni Kai Triad robbed Sato's mansion. A firebender killed Sato's wife during the break in.
Korra says:  That's terrible.
Tenzin says: It was tragic. It's possible that he's been harboring anti-bending sentiment all this time.
Lin says: Maybe we should look at Mr. Sato a little more closely.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says:  What's going on? Why are they asking Hiroshi more questions?
Korra says: I overheard him on the phone yesterday. Asami, I don't know how to tell you this, but I think your father might be involved with the Equalists.
Asami says:  What? I don't believe this. 
Mako says: You spied on Hiroshi?  What's your problem? 
Lin says: Mr. Sato, we just have a few follow-up questions for you.
Asami says:  My father is innocent. Just because we're not benders doesn't mean we support those awful Equalists. 
Hiroshi Sato says: Equalists?  Is that what this is about? I can assure you I have nothing to do with those radicals.
Mako says:  Yeah, you don't know what you're talking about, Korra.
Korra says:  I overheard you on the phone. You said the Cabbage Corp investigation bought you time, and you're getting ready to strike. Explain that!
Hiroshi Sato says:  This is all just a misunderstanding, resulting from the young Avatar's overactive imagination. My number one competitor was knocked out of the game. It's providing me an opportunity to strike the market with a new line of Satomobiles.  It's just business. Nothing nefarious. 
Tenzin says:  In order to put all suspicions to rest, might we have a look into your factories and warehouses?
Hiroshi Sato says:  If you feel it's necessary, you're welcome to search all of Future Industries.
</scene>

<scene>
News reporter says:  Is it possible, presidents of Cabbage Corp and Future Industries both have Equalist ties, or did Hiroshi Sato frame his longtime rival, Lau Gan-Lan?  Or did Chief Beifong just plain arrest the wrong man?  So far the investigation has yielded no evidence to incriminate Sato. 
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: I can't believe we didn't find anything.
Lin says: It would appear Hiroshi is innocent.
Asami says:  Okay, you did your search. Now you can all leave.
Lin says:  Hmm.
Mako says: So, I hope you're convinced now.
Korra says: No, I'm not! I don't care how cooperative Hiroshi is being, I know he's lying.
Mako says:  Why are you doing this? Are you that jealous of me and Asami? 
Korra says:  What?  Don't be ridiculous! That has nothing to do with it!
Mako says:  If you don't drop this, consider our friendship over.
Korra says: I'm sorry. Hiroshi is not the man you think he is.
Mako says:  Hmph.

Warehouse worker says:  Psst.  Over here.  Listen, I joined the Equalists because I believed in what Amon said. I thought he could make life better for us nonbenders. But I didn't sign up for this ...  this war.
Lin says:  What do you have on Hiroshi Sato?
Warehouse worker says: He manufactured those gloves  for the Equalists.
Korra says:  I knew it!
Warehouse worker says:  And there are rumors he's working on something even bigger. Some new kind of weapon.
Tenzin says:  We searched all of Future Industries and found nothing.
Warehouse worker says: That's because he has a secret factory.
Korra says:  Where?
Warehouse worker says:  It's right underneath the Sato Mansion.
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says: Raiding the Sato Mansion is a risky move with Tarrlok breathing down your neck. If we're wrong ...
Lin says: I know. I can kiss my job goodbye. But protecting Republic City is all I care about. We can't let Amon get his hands on this new weapon.
</scene>

<scene>
Asami says:  What are you doing here?
Lin says: We have a reason to believe that there's a factory hidden below the mansion.
Asami says:  I think I would've noticed if there were a factory underneath my house. The lies you people come up with just to persecute my father.
Tenzin says: Where is your father?
Asami says: In his workshop, behind the house.
Asami says:  Dad? Hello?
Officer says:  Chief, the estate's been secured. No one has left the workshop since we arrived.
Lin says: Perhaps we just couldn't see him leaving.
Lin says: There's a tunnel beneath the workshop running deep into the mountainside.
Asami says:  What? There's no tunnel. 
Bolin says:  Do you think your dad knows about this tunnel?
Asami says:  I don't understand. There must be an explanation.
Korra says:  Maybe you don't know everything about your father.  I'm sorry.
Lin says:  Officers,  into the tunnel. Be cautious.  Uh-uh, you three stay up here.  Officer Song, keep an eye on them.
Lin says: Not your average backyard workshop.
Korra says:  And I'm guessing those are the new weapons. 
Tenzin says: Hiroshi was lying all right, but where is he? 
Bolin says: What was that?
Mako says: We need to get down there and see what's going on.
Song says:  Absolutely not. You're staying put until the chief comes back.
Mako says:  All right, we'll stay put. But could we wait outside or something? It's so dusty in this workshop.
Song says: No! We're waiting right here!
Mako says: Okay, but don't blame me if I start sne-  if I start sn-sn-sneez- 
Song says: What's your problem, bub?
Mako says: I'm about to-  Sorry pal, we know you were just doing your job.
Bolin says: Yeah, just stay put until the chief comes back. That's sounds very familiar doesn't it, why? Because you said it. 
Mako says: Asami, you should stay here. We'll check it out.
Asami says:  I have to find out the truth about my father.
Mako says: I understand. That's why I'm going down, to find out for you. Please.
Asami says:  All right.  Be careful.
Hiroshi Sato says:  I'm afraid you won't be able to metalbend that wall, Chief Beifong.  It's solid platinum.  My mecha tanks are platinum as well.  Not even your renowned mother could bend a metal so pure.
Korra says:  Hiroshi, I knew you were a lying, no good Equalist! Come out here and-
Hiroshi Sato says:  And do what, young Avatar? Face the wrath of your bending? No. I think I'll fight from inside here where my odds are a little more ... equal.
Lin says: That source was a set-up! You lured us down here! 
Hiroshi Sato says: Guilty as charged.
Tenzin says: Korra!
</scene>

<scene>
Hiroshi Sato says: Well, I'd say that was a near flawless test run.  Load everyone into the transports and deliver them to Amon!
Bolin says: Oh no.
Mako says: Korra was right. We gotta do something, quick!
Hiroshi Sato says: Not so fast, boys. 
Bolin says:  Hello, Mr. Sato. Wow! What a really swell, scary factory you have here under your giant mansion.
Mako says:  Sponsoring our team, supporting the Avatar. It was all just a big cover.
Hiroshi Sato says: Yes, and the most difficult part was watching my daughter traipse around with a firebending street rat like you! 
Asami says: Dad, stop!  Why?
Hiroshi Sato says:  Sweetie, I wanted to keep you out of this as long as I could.  But now you know the truth, please, forgive me.  These people,  these benders. They took away your mother, the love of my life. They've ruined the world, but with Amon we can fix it and build a perfect world together. We can help people like us, everywhere!  Join me, Asami.
Mako says:  No ...
Asami says:  I love you, Dad.
Mako says:  Let's get out of here!

Lin says:  My metalbenders are on their way to Amon, and it's all my fault. Tarrlok's right, I've failed as chief. First thing in the morning, I'm handing in my resignation.
Tenzin says:  No! You can't give up like this!
Lin says:  I'm not giving up. I'm gonna find my officers and take Amon down. But I'm gonna do it my way, outside the law. 
Mako says:  I'm sorry I didn't believe you. But Asami's dad being an Equalist is not an easy thing to believe. Even now.
Korra says: I know. I'm sorry this whole thing happened.
Mako says: So ... does your offer to live in the Air Temple still stand?
Korra says:  Of course it does. And Asami's welcome, too.
Mako says:  Thank you so much.
Korra says:  After everything she's been through, she's going to need you, Mako.

Shiro Shinobi says:  Bolin's a hero. The mover's star stopped Varrick's kidnapping attempt on President Raiko, proving his brother's innocence. Mako and Korra were reunited, but Korra has no memory of their break-up. Meanwhile, Jinora's spirit is still trapped in the Spirit World, and Tonraq and his southern forces have been defeated. Now it's up to Team Avatar to stop Unalaq before Harmonic Convergence.

Mako says: What's up with the coat? And where did you get that pie?
Bolin says: It's a Varrick ship, you never know what you're gonna find. There's a whole level filled with fun-house mirrors. Of course, there's also the catgator deck.  I miss that guy, he really knew how to make a long trip interesting. So, have you told Korra yet about how  you guys broke up, and you kinda started dating Asami while she was off getting attacked by dark spirits?
Mako says:  Will you keep it down? I'm waiting for the right moment.
Bolin says: Oh Mako, you know a wise man once told me that delivering bad news to a girlfriend was like ripping off a blood-sucking leech: you just have to do it fast and get it over with.
Mako says: I hate it when you listen to me. Fine!
Tenzin says:  Unalaq will be waiting for you. You'll need all of your Avatar power to stop him.
Korra says:  I'm going to close the spirit portals, lock Vaatu in for another ten thousand years, and make Unalaq wish he'd never been born.

Kya says: Woah! Since when does my little brother wanna crash or blast through anything?
Tenzin says:  I'll do whatever it takes to save my daughter.
Bumi says:  We all want to save Jinora, but I think your plan might be a tad over-aggressive, seeing as there are only seven of us and one ship.
Tenzin says: Really? And what do you suggest?
Bumi says:  An attack like this calls for strategy. I remember when I was surrounded by pirates at the Hurricane Straits. We managed to capture them all, with just a feather, two eggs and a barrel of molasses.
Tenzin says:  I don't want to hear any of your crazy stories now! This is serious!

Korra says: I talked to the rebels. They said Unalaq's got the southern portal surrounded.  Harmonic Convergence is only a few hours away.
Tenzin says:  Then we have to break through the enemy lines ourselves and get to the portal now.
Korra says:  There's no use in talking any more. We know what our mission is.
Bolin says: A suicide mission ...
Bumi says:  You know, I was in a similar situation once. My platoon had crawled through the desert with no water for a week! But when we finally located the only oasis for a hundred miles,  it was surrounded by angry sandbenders. I realized our only chance to get to the water was to drop in from above.  So I fashioned together a catapult, and with the help of a few well-trained hog monkeys ...
Tenzin says: Enough of your ridiculous lies! Can't you see that the fate of the world and Jinora's life depends on what we do here today?!
Asami says: Hold on, maybe Bumi's right.  We don't have a catapult and hog monkeys, but we have a flying bison and there's a plane on Varrick's ship. Maybe we can attack from above.
Korra says:  What are you thinking?
Asami says:  Mako, Bolin and I can use the plane to create a distraction, and scatter some of the defenses. You, Tenzin, Bumi and Kya can fly into the spirit portal on Oogi when you see an opening.
Korra says:  Let's get moving.

Unalaq says:  You don't understand. Everything I've achieved so far will pale in comparison with what I'm about to accomplish.
Desna says:  What else is there? The Water Tribe is united.
Unalaq says: After today, there will be no more Water Tribe; no more nations of any kind.  The world is about to be transformed into something magnificent, and new.  And I will lead this glorious revolution. Now go outside and get the troops ready to defend the spirit portal.
Eska says: From whom? We've already beaten everyone.
Unalaq says: The Avatar will be here soon. She has no choice ...

Unalaq says: Congratulations, everyone.  You've all got front row seats for the beginning of a new world order.
Korra says:  You don't know what you're doing, Unalaq. Freeing Vaatu won't make you powerful, it will only make you a traitor to everything good that's happened over the last ten thousand years.
Unalaq says:  You think what Avatar Wan did was good? Driving almost all the spirits from this world? The Avatar hasn't brought balance, only chaos. You call yourself the bridge between the two worlds,  but there shouldn't be a bridge: we should live together as one.
Korra says: Even if Vaatu escapes, I'll put him right back in his prison, just like Wan did.
Unalaq says:  It's true that when Wan fused with Raava he tipped the scales in her favor, but this time I'll be here to level the playing field. When Harmonic Convergence comes, I will fuse with Vaatu, and together we will become the new Avatar:  a Dark Avatar. Your era is over.
Tonraq says:  Think about what you're doing. I know that you've always had a deep connection with the spirits, but you're still a man. You're still my brother, you're Eska and Desna's father. Are you willing to throw your humanity away to become a monster?
Unalaq says:  I'll be no more of a monster than your own daughter. The only difference is that while she can barely recognize her own spiritual power, I will be in complete alignment with mine. Vaatu and I will be as one. No one will be able to stand against us.  Keep them locked up. After the Harmonic Convergence, I will come for Korra.

Korra says: Please.  If you let me out now, I can still stop him from destroying everything.  Once he fuses with Vaatu, no one will be safe. Desna, he won't be your father anymore.

Bolin says: No, I was scared. I was scared of my true feelings for you. Gah, I should have never left you. I'm sorry. And I'm sorry that we'll never have the chance to rekindle the dying ember that was our love into a big fire of love flames.
Eska says: You'll never defeat my father. But, should you survive, perhaps we could spend eternal darkness together.

<scene>
Shiro Shinobi says:  Korra and Jinora have entered the Spirit World. With Tenzin's daughter as her spiritual guide, the Avatar has one mission – to close the spirit portal before Harmonic Convergence. Meanwhile, Unalaq has been working with the dark spirit Vaatu, who was imprisoned by Avatar Wan ten thousand years ago. Will Korra be able to close the portal and stop Unalaq from enacting his deadly plan?
</scene>

Tenzin says: I can't believe my little girl had to guide Korra into the Spirit World instead of me. If anything happens to her I won't be able to forgive myself.
Kya says:  She's very smart, and she obviously has a strong connection to the spirits. She'll be fine.
Bumi says: Yeah, Dad went all the time!
Tenzin says: They won't have their bending in there. They'll be defenseless!
Bumi says:  Ahem? Excuse me? But I've never had bending, and I don't think I'd call myself defenseless.
Tenzin says: Of course you aren't, because you have your ...  um ...
Kya says:  Positive attitude?
Bumi says:  I would've said acute intellect and cat-like reflexes, but whatever.
Tenzin says: Why don't you two get some sleep. I'll take the first watch.
Kya says: Wake us up if you need some company.
Bumi says: Or if any interesting spirit-y stuff happens, like their bodies start floating around and you need someone to help you grab them before they fly off!
Kya says:  Bumi!
Bumi says:  I'm just saying, we're here if you need us.
Tenzin says: I know you are. Thank you.  Please come back soon.

Jinora says: Isn't it beautiful?
Korra says:  Just ... stick close to me, okay? This seems nice, but you never know when we'll run into some dark spirits. Huh! 
Jinora says: Look! It's like it's made of jewels!  The spirits are so much more beautiful in their own world than they are at home.
Korra says: Jinora, be careful! Hold on!  Uh! 
Meerkat spirit #1 says: Hey! Watch where you're going, you giant clod!
Korra says: Sorry!
Meerkat spirit #1 says: This is a residential area, in case you hadn't noticed. Who do you think you are, stomping through here like that?
Korra says:  I'm the Avatar.
Meerkat spirit #2 says:  The Avatar?  Not impressed.
Korra says: I'm trying to find the spirit portals? I opened one-
Meerkat spirit #3 says: I heard Unalaq did that!
Korra says: No, I did, but-
Meerkat spirit #4 says: Well if you opened it, how come you don't know where it is? Huh?
Korra says: B-because I was at the South Pole!
Meerkat spirit #5 says: I don't trust her.
Meerkat spirit #6 says: Get out of our world!
Meerkat spirit #7 says: We don't need you!
Meerkat spirit #8 says: You don't belong here!
Korra says: Get away from me! 
Meerkat spirit #1 says: Did you guys see that?! She tried to bend at us, in our own holes! Get her!
Korra says: Jinora!
Jinora says: Korra! Stay calm! Your energy is upsetting them. You're only making it worse!

</scene>

Jinora says:  Furry-Foot?  Is that you?  It's so good to see you again!  You're so big here.  I don't suppose you know where Korra is, do you?  We were supposed to go find the spirit portals,  but I don't know how to find anything down here.

Jinora says:  It's like an awesome tree house!  Wait, I've read about this place.  Grandpa Aang came here. It's Wan Shi Tong's Spirit Library.

Korra says:  I know you.
Iroh says: I was good friends  with Avatar Aang.
Korra says: Iroh!
Iroh says: Hello, Korra.
</scene>

<scene>
Iroh says: I'm glad you came to visit us in the Spirit World, Korra. You came just in time.  We're having a little tea party, to celebrate May-Jim's wedding. 
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: How can you marry each other? Aren't you ...
May says: Complete opposites? I know!
Jim says: I tried to fight it, but she really grew on me!
Iroh says: The Spirit World is very mysterious, but so is love. Help yourself to some tea and cakes.  They are spirit cakes, so you won't gain any weight-  of course, you won't lose any either!
Korra says: This part of the Spirit World isn't so scary.  My teapot!
Iroh says: That's right. It was yours long, long ago.  When you were Avatar Wan, you used it to carry the light spirit, Raava, around- until the two of you became one. It is my favorite thing I found here.  You know, when you make tea in it, you can still taste a little light in every cup.
</scene>

<scene>
Jinora says: Wow. I could just stay in here forever, reading.
Wan Shi Tong says: The last human who said that is still here.
</scene>

<scene>
Jinora says: Professor Zei!
Wan Shi Tong says: I see that you have some knowledge of the past, so you should know that humans are no longer allowed in my library. Get out. 
Jinora says: I thought anyone could come in if they brought you some new knowledge?
Wan Shi Tong says: Those are the old rules. Besides, what has a little girl got to teach Wan Shi Tong, he who knows ten thousand things?
Jinora says: Well, since you've been down in the Spirit World, the humans have invented radio. 
Wan Shi Tong says: Yes, I am well aware of the radio.
Jinora says: But do you know how it works?
Wan Shi Tong says: Of course I do! There is a box, and inside the box, there is a tiny man who sings and plays musical instruments.
Jinora says: Actually, when we speak, our voices produce sound waves. Radio takes those sound waves and converts them into electromagnetic energy that is transmitted through the spectrum-
Wan Shi Tong says: All right, enough. I did not know this.  Apparently, I have been fed some misinformation about the existence of tiny men in boxes.  Still, I am not interested in that human garbage. Now, go away.
Jinora says: My grandfather was the Avatar, and I came to the Spirit World with the new Avatar to find the spirit portals. I would think that you'd wanna help me.
Wan Shi Tong says: You came with the Avatar, hm? Well, why didn't you say so! Fine, you may look around. But don't break anything- I'll know. 
Jinora says: Come on, Furry-Foot, we gotta hurry!

Iroh says: They say that the game of Pai Sho was invented by the spirits ... although some of them don't seem to grasp it very well. 
Lotus spirit says: Just hold on. I'm thinking. 
Iroh says: As you can see, it is a game that requires great patience. But time does not mean much to us here.
Korra says: How long have you lived here?
Iroh says: Oh, I've been here for many years. I had always enjoyed the company of the spirits,  so when my work was done in the material world,  I chose to leave my body behind and come to the Spirit World! It can be a wonderful place, and I've made so many friends.  Korra, what's wrong?
Korra says: I came here with my friend, but I lost her and now I'm all alone.
Iroh says: You're not alone Korra, it's okay.
Korra says: No! It's not okay! Jinora's gone and I need to find her! She's lost, and we need to go home!  I don't like the Spirit World, I don't want to be here anymore! 
</scene>

<scene>
May says: Did you say something to her?
Jim says: Me? You're the one with the big mouth!
Iroh says: Korra, please stop! Look at what you're doing to everyone!
Korra says:  I did that?
Iroh says: In the Spirit World, your emotions become your reality- especially for the Avatar, because you are the bridge between the two worlds. You must try to stay positive. 
Korra says: I'm sorry.
Iroh says: There, you see?
Korra says: I can make the sun shine?
Iroh says: Even in the material world, you will find that if you look for the light, you can often find it. But if you look for the dark,  that is all you will ever see.
Korra says: I'm looking for my friend. I want her here now!  Why didn't she come out like the sun?
Iroh says: I'm afraid finding her won't be so easy.
Korra says: But what am I supposed to do?
Iroh says: Sometimes the best way to solve your own problems is to help someone else.  This little fellow needs to go home as well. Maybe if you help him find his friends, you will be able to find yours. 
Korra says: I'll take him home! Where do I go?
Iroh says: The dragon bird nest is located there, at the top of Hai-Riyo Peak.
</scene>

<scene>
Jinora says: Ugh, it's not in here either! I have to find the portals. Korra is probably waiting for me there right now! I need to find a map that shows where the spirit portals are, could you help me? Thanks, this is it! The Tree of Time! That's where Avatar Wan imprisoned Vaatu! The elders believe that as long as the portals are closed during the Harmonic Convergence, Vaatu will remain imprisoned and the battle between good and evil will not be fought again. But, if both portals are open, spirit energy is amplified greatly. During the Harmonic Convergence, this energy will be great enough to allow Vaatu to break free from his bonds, and the material world will again risk being consumed by darkness. We have to warn Korra!
Unalaq says: Leaving so soon? When Wan Shi Tong told me he had a visitor, I had to see it with my own eyes. I can't believe Tenzin sent his daughter here instead of coming himself - what kind of a father is he?
Jinora says: Better than you. Wan Shi Tong, how can you be helping him?
Wan Shi Tong says: Unalaq has proven to be a true friend to the spirits - unlike the Avatar.
Jinora says: Why would you wanna help Vaatu escape? He'll destroy everything!
Unalaq says: Don't believe everything you read. Why don't you come with me, so you can do some firsthand research? 
Jinora says: Furry-Foot ...?
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: This looks scary. Will you come with me?
Iroh says: This is something that you must do on your own. The people who have been coming to the Spirit World lately have brought darkness and anger. So that is what you see now. But you have light and peace inside of you. If you let it out, you can change the world around you. Besides, look at this little fellow. This mountain is his home. When you first met him, you were frightened. But does he seem scary to you now?
Korra says: No!
Iroh says: Many things that seem threatening in the dark become welcoming when we shine light on them. It was good to meet you. Come visit me again - in this life, or the next.
Korra says: Bye! Okay, time for you to go home. Light and peace ... light and peace ...
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: I'm not afraid of you. You're not scary! You just look that way. I have light inside! It's okay, you can be my friends. My name is Korra, and I'm taking this dragon bird home! Iroh said you could be nice. Do you wanna help me? All right, now let's close that portal and go find Jinora.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: That's where Vaatu is.
Vaatu says: So you've returned, Raava. The Harmonic Convergence is coming soon, and this time, I'm going to wipe you out for good.
Korra says: I think you've said that before, Vaatu. But I'm here to close the portal. You're not getting out.
Vaatu says: You might want to reconsider- that is if you want to save your friend.
Korra says: Jinora!  I can't believe I trusted you! You made me think you wanted to restore balance with spirits, but this- this isn't balance, it's madness! Now let her go!
Unalaq says: If you want your friend to make it out of the Spirit World, you'll open the other portal now.
Jinora says: Don't do it Korra!
Unalaq says: What will it be? Open the portal- or lose your friend's soul forever?
Korra says: Stop! I'll do it.  Now let Jinora go. Ahhh! 
Unalaq says: You should've come through the portal. Then you could do this!
Jinora says: Ahhh! Korra!
Korra says: Ahhh!
Vaatu says: I'll see you soon, Raava. Once the Harmonic Convergence comes, I'll be free from this prison, and then I will have my revenge!
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says: Korra! What was it like? Did you manage to close the portal? Was Jinora able to help you?
Korra says: Tenzin- I'm ... I'm sorry.

For the first time in three years, Korra will finally be back in Republic City! Meanwhile, Varrick and Bolin escaped from Baatar Jr. and are on the run. But will they make it back to the city in time to warn everyone about Kuvira's new spirit energy super weapon?

Meelo says:  Proud enough to get me my tats?
Tenzin says:  No.
Tenzin says: Welcome home.
Korra says: I missed you, Tenzin.
Tenzin says: Now, I hate to get right down to business, but I want to hear what happened in Zaofu.
Bumi says: Way to ruin the moment.
Opal says: Kuvira's whole army was there. She captured Mom, Dad, and my brothers.
Korra says:  I thought I was strong enough to stop her. I feel like such a failure.
Tenzin says: No one expected you to handle Kuvira on your own. It's up to all of us to find a way to deal with her.  We're just glad to have you back.
Bumi says: Where's Bolin? He's not still on Kuvira's side, is he?
Opal says: I can't believe he would stay with her after what she did to my family. But we don't know where he is.

Bolin says: How about you use your own legs for a while?
Varrick says: You know, when I fled Republic City with Zhu Li, she carried me twenty miles in one day. And that was after she sprained her ankle.
Bolin says:  Well, Zhu Li's not here, okay?
Varrick says:  That's fine, leave me here, let the worms gobble me up. I deserve it.
Bolin says: No way mister! You're not getting off that easily. You're responsible for that weapon Kuvira is trying to make. Which, may I remind you, could hurt a lot of people.
Varrick says: No, don't remind me! I know, I'm a horrible, horrible person!
Bolin says:  Okay, look. Kuvira fooled us both into doing her dirty work and I'm not happy about it either. But, you know how we're gonna make it up to the world? By getting back to Republic City and warning everyone what she's up to! So, I want you to take my hand  and march with me out of this forest!
Varrick says:  You really have a way with words, kid. No wonder I made you a mover star. All right, I'll take the driver's seat for a while, hop on. 
Bolin says: Oh, great, my feet could use a break. 
Varrick says:  Oh, boy, here we go!

Korra says: You too.
Asami says: And I'm loving the hair.
Korra says: Thanks.  You're looking snazzy as always.
Asami says: Come on. Mako got us a table at the restaurant.
Mako says: Korra!
Korra says: Hi, Mako. 
Wu says:  Hello there, Prince Wu, rightful heir to the throne and  this guy's boss. I bet he's told you a lot about me.
Korra says: Nope. Not a thing.
Wu says:  Then we have so much to talk about.  You are going to love the food here, I know the chef personally.  Let's start with a round of your spicy octopus fritters  and keep the cucumber-aloe water coming!  Gotta keep this princely skin hydrated.
Asami says:  I thought it was going to be the three of us.
Mako says: Sorry, but I couldn't ditch him. But he promised to be on his best behavior.
Wu says:  Hey, pop into the Avatar State for me. I want to see your eyes glow.
Korra says:  What? No! 
Asami says: So can you go into the Avatar State again? I was worried when you told me you couldn't.
Mako says: Wait, when did she tell you she couldn't?  What's going on with you two?
Korra says:  I wrote to Asami while I was away. I asked her not to tell you. I'm sorry.
Mako says: Well, why didn't you ever write to me? Or Bolin?
Korra says: I don't know. I guess ... I didn't know what to say.
Mako says:  "Hello" would have been nice.
Wu says: Mako, if it makes you feel any better, she didn't write me either.
Mako says:  Why would she ...  Never mind.
Korra says: I'm sorry I didn't stay in touch, but I'm back now.  And I wanna know everything about what's been going on with you two.
Asami says: Well, I kind of have some big news. I went to visit my father for the first time. He had been writing me letters and I guess I finally felt ready to try and forgive him.
Korra says: You sure you can trust him? He might just be manipulating you again.
Asami says:  You think I don't know what my own father is capable of?
Korra says:  No, I didn't mean ...
Asami says:  You don't get to disappear for three years and then act like you know what's best for me!
Korra says: It's not like I planned to be gone for that long, I wanted to come back, but I never felt ready until now.
Wu says: As much as I'm enjoying this little catch-up, my royal bladder is about to explode. Mako, come on, I need you to stand guard.
Mako says: I'm not gonna hold your hand every time you have to empty your "royal bladder". Go to the bathroom on your own for once.
Wu says:  Fine. 
Korra says: Do you always go to the bathroom with him?
Mako says: I don't go with him, with him, I just stand there in the general vicinity while he ... I don't wanna talk about it.
Bathroom attendant says: Good afternoon, Sir. Perhaps a spritz of cologne, to freshen up?
Wu says: Make it a double, buddy!
Wu says:  Mako, help! Wu ... down ...

Ahnah says: Well look what we caught. Wonder if they were tracking us after we escaped.
Bolin says: Hello fellow travelers! I don't suppose you can help us out of this net?
Ahnah says: Why would we free a couple of lowly Earth Empire soldiers?
Varrick says: Lowly? We were part of Kuvira's inner circle!
Bolin says: Were, not anymore! Please, just, let us out!
Baraz says: I know just what to do with a couple of Kuvira's top men.

Korra says: I'll be right back. 
Korra says: Excuse me, did you happen to see if Prince Wu came out this way?
Bathroom attendant says: Sorry miss, I haven't seen him.
Wu says:  Hmm, I'm in laundry ...
Korra says: They've got Wu! Get the car, I'm going after them!
Asami says: Get in!
Korra says: We're losing them!
Mako says: Hang a right at the next block. We can cut them off on Seventh.
Mako says: You missed the turn! Where are you going?!
Asami says: I know these streets better than you. I built some of them!
Mako says: What are you doing? Sit down!
Korra says: Where is he?
Korra says: Wu's not here. This guy was the only one in the truck.
Mako says:  Where's the prince?
Bathroom attendant says: Halfway to Kuvira by now.  All hail the Great Uniter.
Asami says: They must have moved Wu to a different vehicle when we lost sight of them.
Mako says:  Take this guy in for booking. Charge him with kidnapping and tell Chief Beifong that Prince Wu is missing. Put out an all-points bulletin. We'll keep looking.
Asami says: Where do we start? There are thousands of cars in the city and he could be in any one of them.
Mako says: Or they might try smuggling him out on an airship.
Asami says: Or maybe a boat.
Mako says: He could be anywhere!  The one time I don't watch him pee and this is what happens.
Korra says:  They're taking Wu to the train station!
Asami says: Are you sure? How do you know?
Korra says:  I'll explain on the way, just drive! We're running out of time!

Bolin says: So how did a bunch of water and firebenders end up in one of Kuvira's reeducation camps?
Ahnah says:  Call it what it is: a prison.
Baraz says: Kuvira's been purging states of anyone who's not of Earth Kingdom origin and locking them up.
Bolin says:  Purging?!
Baraz says: What are you acting so surprised for? You must have known what she was up to, being part of her "inner circle" and all.
Bolin says: No, I swear! And the inner circle thing lasted like, less than a day!
Varrick says:  Will you at least tell us where you're taking us?
Baraz says: The border checkpoint. You're gonna help us talk our way past some Earth Empire soldiers.
Ahnah says: And once we're through, we'll see about letting you go.
Varrick says:  Lava time! Bet you didn't expect that!
Bolin says:  Look, I'm sorry for what happened to all of you, but as I've been trying to explain, we don't work for Kuvira anymore.
Varrick says: Yeah. If our handsome mugs get recognized trying to go through that checkpoint, we're goners!
Baraz says: If you really are fugitives, you better listen up. We've been scouting this region for days. There's a wall stretching along the entire border and patrols guarding every part of it. That checkpoint is the only way out.
Ahnah says: It's not worth the risk, Baraz. How do we know they won't turn us in?
Baraz says: If he wanted us gone, we'd be at the bottom of a pool of lava right now. If any of us want to get out of the Earth Empire alive, we'll have to trust each other.
Bolin says:  All right, where is this checkpoint?
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says:  So, how do you know where Wu is just by touching some spirit vines?
Korra says: I learned how to connect to people's energies through them.
Asami says: Who taught you that?
Korra says: Lin's mom.  I found her in the swamp, that place is like one giant spirit wild.
Asami says: You met Toph? What was she like?
Korra says: A cranky, more miserable version of Lin.
Mako says: Is that even possible?
Korra says: You'd be surprised.
Mako says: Which train is Wu on?
Korra says: I don't know!
Mako says: Split up and start looking.

Bolin says:  Follow my lead.
Guard post soldier says:  Good afternoon, sir. Can we help you?
Bolin says: You sure can. We captured these escaped prisoners. We need to get them to a secure facility.
Guard post soldier says: Where did they escape from?
Bolin says: Camp fourteen.
Guard post soldier says: Then why are you bringing them through here? Camp fourteen is the other way.
Bolin says:  You think we don't know where Camp fourteen is? Kuvira wants them transferred.
Guard post soldier says: Then I'll need to see the transfer order.
Varrick says: Listen pal! I had to fight off two badgermoles, six wolfbats and eighteen hog monkeys to capture these guys, so sorry if I don't have the paperwork! I was too busy cramming it in a hog monkey's mouth, while it was trying to eat me! I am in sore need of a shower and I have blisters that are the size of cantaloupes and twice as juicy! So you can let us through, or you can give us your name and rank and I'll make sure to pass it on to Kuvira! You know what happens to soldiers who question her orders, don't you? Bad stuff!
Guard post soldier says:  Let them through!
Guard #2 says: Wait! Stop them, they're traitors to the Empire!
Baraz says: There's no way I'm going back to prison!
Varrick says:  Boy, I sure hope this works.
Varrick says:  I still got that Varrick touch!  We're clear, come on!
Bolin says:  Varrick, wait, we can't leave them!
Guard post soldier says: Retreat!
Baraz says: Thanks. You didn't have to come back.
Bolin says: Yeah. I kind of did. Let's go!

Mako says: How do you know for sure he's here?
Korra says: I don't. But I had a feeling, okay?
Mako says: And I'm just supposed to trust your "Avatar Feelings"?
Korra says:  You wouldn't have to if you had guarded the prince like you were supposed to.
Mako says:  Oh, so it's my fault Wu disappeared.
Korra says: It's certainly not mine!
Asami says: Guys, shh. Listen.
Mako says:  Wu! Wu, it's me.

Wu says:  Yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  You are definitely getting a raise, Buddy.
Mako says: You should be thanking Korra. We never would have found you with out her.
Wu says:  I owe you my life, Avatar. If only there was some way to repay you. Oh, I know.  How about I take you out for a night on the town?
Korra says:  Really? You're asking me out right now?
Wu says:  So ... I put you down for a "maybe"? 
Korra says: How about a never?
Korra says: Not exactly what I imagined for our first day back together.
Asami says: But it was kind of like old times.  Except for the getting on each other's nerves part.
Mako says: Actually, that is like old times for me and Korra.
Korra says: I'm sorry things got so tense earlier.
Asami says: It's all right. I guess after being apart for three years, there's bound to be a bit of an adjustment period.
Mako says: Yeah, but it's great to have you back.
Korra says: There's no place else I'd rather be.
Wu says: You guys are the greatest friends a guy could have.
Korra says: So, what are we gonna do with him? It's too dangerous to take him back to the hotel.

Shiro Shinobi says:  After fusing with Vaatu, Unalaq became a Dark Avatar and ripped Korra and Raava apart! By destroying Raava, Unalaq and Vaatu transformed into the most powerful dark spirit that's ever lived.

Tenzin says:  I was able to rescue her soul, but she wasn't ready to return to her body yet.  She sensed that the world was in grave danger.
Korra says:  She was right. 
Tenzin says: Were you able to stop Unalaq and Vaatu?
Korra says: No. They fused, then Vaatu ripped Raava right out of me and destroyed her. Vaatu won.
Bolin says:  No. I am too young to live through ten thousand years of darkness. Korra, can't you talk to one of your past lives or something?
Korra says: When Vaatu destroyed Raava, he destroyed my connection to the past Avatars too.
Tenzin says: If that's true, then-
Korra says: The cycle is over. I'm the last Avatar.  I'm so sorry, Tenzin.

Tenzin says: The other Avatars may not be able to help you anymore, but, perhaps I can.
Korra says:  No one can help me now.
Tenzin says:  I know I haven't been the best mentor to you. But I realized it was because I had a lot of spiritual growth to do myself. There may still be a way for you to stop Vaatu.
Korra says: How?
Tenzin says:  Let go of your attachment to who you think you are, and connect with your inner spirit.
Korra says: Haven't you heard anything I said? Raava is gone. I'm not connected to her spirit anymore.
Tenzin says: I'm not talking about Raava. Raava is not who you are.  Come with me, I need to show you something.
Korra says: Why are you showing me Vaatu's prison?
Tenzin says: Because this tree had a history long before it held Vaatu. This is the Tree of Time. And the legends say its roots bind the spirit and physical worlds together.
Korra says: And, you think this tree can help me somehow?
Tenzin says: Yes. I have read that long ago, the ancients would meditate beneath this tree and connect with the great cosmic energy of the universe.
Korra says: These are my memories.
Tenzin says: The Tree of Time remembers all. Korra, the most powerful thing about you is not the spirit of Raava, but your own inner spirit. You have always been strong, unyielding, fearless. 
Korra says: Avatar Wan.
Tenzin says: Before he fused with Raava, Wan was just a regular person.
Korra says: But, he was brave, and ... smart, and always wanted to defend the helpless.
Tenzin says:  That's right. He became a legend because of who he was, not what he was. He wasn't defined by Raava anymore than you are. 
Korra says:  Everyone in Republic City is in danger.
Tenzin says: You have to help them, Korra.
Korra says: How? We're half-way around the world.
Tenzin says:  Do as the ancients once did. Connect to the cosmic energy of the universe. Don't bend the elements, but the energy within yourself.
Korra says: You really think I can do this?
Tenzin says: I have no doubt.
Korra says:  Thank you for not giving up on me.
Tenzin says: I'm proud of you.
Wan says: If you and Vaatu have the same fight every ten thousand years, why hasn't one of you destroyed the other?
Raava says: He cannot destroy light, anymore than I can destroy darkness. One cannot exist without the other.
Unavaatu says: Find the light in the dark.

Korra says:  I'm sorry about your father. But he was already fused with Vaatu. I couldn't save him.
Eska says: It seems cousin Korra is under the impression we're saddened by our father's demise.
Desna says: But I will not miss him at all. In the end, he became a deplorable man.
Eska says: Agreed. But how will we explain this to mother?
Bolin says: So, I was thinking. I'm not really a fan of a long-distance relationship thing,  so how about you move to Republic City with me.
Eska says: I do not think it will be possible.
Bolin says:  Okay. Desna can come too.
Eska says: I will not be joining you, Bolin. Desna and I must return home.
Bolin says: But you said-
Eska says: Eternal darkness was upon us. I became caught up in the moment.

Korra says:  No. I think that link is gone, forever.
Tenzin says: I see. Why don't you close the portals, and we'll go home.
Korra says: Maybe I shouldn't.
Tenzin says: What do you mean?
Korra says:  What if Unalaq was right when he said the Avatar shouldn't be a bridge between the two worlds?  What if Avatar Wan made a mistake when he closed the portals?  What if humans and spirits weren't meant to live apart?  Well, what do you think I should do?
Tenzin says:  I think you should trust your instincts. There is nothing else I can teach you. You are the Avatar. Whatever your decision, I support you.
</scene>

Mako says:  Hey, can we talk?
Korra says: Of course.
Mako says: There's something I've been wanting to tell you about that fight we had. I know I said it wasn't that bad, but, that's not exactly true. I, um ... I-I broke up with you.
Korra says: I remember.
Mako says: But, I thought you said you lost part of your memory.
Korra says: I did, but being inside the Tree of Time brought it back. I'm sorry for blowing up at you.
Mako says: That's okay.  I think we've both said things that we regret.
Korra says: Why didn't you just tell me the truth in the first place?
Mako says: I know I should have, but ... I didn't wanna hurt you all over again. I guess part of me wanted to forget about the break-up too.
Korra says: I think we both know that this. Us? Doesn't work.
Mako says: You're right.
Korra says: It's over.  For real this time. 
Mako says: I'll always love you, Korra.
Korra says: And I'll always love you. 
Bolin says:  You want a hug?

Korra says: The war of the Water Tribes is over. Unalaq has been defeated, and the Northern fleet is returning home. The Water Tribes will always be allies, but the Southern Tribe is now independent,  and the Southern Council of Elders has appointed my father, Tonraq, to be your new chief!  I've realized that even though we should learn from those who came before us, we must also forge our own path. So that is why I've decided to keep the portals open. Humans can now physically enter the Spirit World, and spirits will be free to roam our world. I will no longer be the bridge. Humans and spirits must learn to live together. My mission will always be to use Raava's light spirit to guide the world toward peace and balance. Harmonic Convergence has caused a shift in the planet's energy. I can feel it. Things will never be the same again. We're entering a New Age.

Now, Korra and Mako plan to infiltrate the Equalists' victory rally and expose Amon as a fraud. Meanwhile, Asami, Bolin, and General Iroh head toward Hiroshi's secret airfield, where Asami intends to take down her father?
Iroh says: I think we've found our secret airfield.  Bolin, once we get down there, I need you to tear up those runways. We can't let those aircraft take off.

Amon says: Thank you all for joining me on this historic occasion!  When I was a boy, a firebender struck down my entire family and left me scarred. That tragic event began my quest to equalize the world.

Lieutenant says:  You want her taken out?
Amon says:  No.  Everyone calm down, we have nothing to fear from the Avatar. Let's hear what she has to say.
Korra says: Amon has been lying to you. The spirits didn't give him the power to take people's bending away. He uses bloodbending to do it.  Amon is a waterbender! 
Lieutenant says:  What is this nonsense?
Amon says:  You're desperate, Avatar. Making up stories about me is a pathetic last resort.
Korra says: Your family wasn't killed by a firebender.  His father was Yakone,  and his brother ... is Councilman Tarrlok.
Amon says: Hmph, an amusing tale, but I will show you the truth.  This is what a firebender did to me.
Korra says:  What? 
Equalist supporter says:  The Avatar is lying!
Korra says: I'm telling you!  He's a waterbender.  They don't believe me. It didn't work!

Bolin says:  She is wonderful, and pretty,  and so smart, and she smells like flowers ...  Sorry. Bolin, out.

Tenzin says: Not so well, I'm afraid. No one seems to be interested in the hard work of becoming part of the Air Nation.
Korra says: You need to give yourself a break. Let Jinora and the kids help you out, and what about Bumi? He was a naval commander, maybe he has some ideas about how you get people motivated.
Tenzin says:  Bumi?! He's my worst student.
Korra says: Yeah, but he loves to organize people. If you ask him for help, you can trick him into taking more responsibility by making him think the whole thing with his idea.

Tenzin says:  What would you do if you were in charge? Help me be more like you.
Bumi says: I'd love to.  You've got to use military discipline to whip these troops into shape. The only way to deal with new recruits is to  break them down so you can  build them back up. Rule with an iron fist.  Show them who the master is.

Tenzin says: Then, this is the perfect time to learn meditation and proper breathing technique. Airbenders are able to warm themselves only with their breathing.  Everyone get into the lotus position. Ah, this is so much more refreshing than sleeping.

Back up your posts! It's not hard if you concentrate.  Get back up!  What's the matter, you can't handle it, soldier? 
Jinora says: Don't you think you're a little hard on them.
Tenzin says: Don't worry, they can take it. You'll see.  Ignore the lemurs digging in your ears. Concentrate on your breathing and, you won't even know they're there!  When the head is shaved, an airbender is able to feel the wind around him. It is both humbling and freeing.
Kai says: Hey, you want to go sneak away and check on the baby bisons?

Tenzin says: All right, who's next?
Yung says: I'm not sure I want to shave my head.
Tenzin says: That's fine, shaving your head is a personal choice.
Daw says:  Wait, what?
Tenzin says: Anyone else?  Fine! Then we can get to our next training exercise: obstacle course. 
Jinora says: You're pushing too hard. Maybe we should give them a break.
Tenzin says: Jinora, I have this under control

Tenzin says: Concentrate! Remember, airbenders move like the wind.
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says: Stay light on your feet, and you'll never feel the stinging rash cactus.
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says: Everyone is waiting for you, Bumi. If you don't make it over the next thirty seconds, they'll all have to run through the course again!
Airbenders says: You can do it, Bumi! Come on!
Tenzin says: Get back up the wall, recruit! You're letting your fellow airbenders down.
Bumi says:  I'm finished! I've never wanted to be an airbender and I'm too old to be back in boot camp.  Count me out!
Tenzin says:  Fine, quit! We don't need your attitude in the new Air Nation.
Daw says: Master Tenzin, when do we get to go home and visit our families?
Tenzin says: Go home? You just got here.
Female airbender says: When's dinner? I'm starving.
Yung says: Can I change out of my robe now? It's itchy.
Kai says: This is just as bad as the Earth Queen's prison.
Tenzin says:  I'm tired of all this complaining! Jinora, take over!
Jinora says: Does this mean, I'm the master now?
Tenzin says: Yes, just lead them through some basic exercises.
Jinora says: Well, since I'm a master, when do you think I can get my tattoos?
Tenzin says: What brought this on?
Jinora says: I was just talking to Kai, and he was asking me, so-
Tenzin says: Kai!  What does he know about when you should get tattoos? The answer is "no"! You're just a little girl.
Jinora says:  I'm not a little girl anymore. I can airbend just as well as you. I know everything about our culture and history, and I have a stronger connection with the spirits that you ever will.  Lead your own class!
Tenzin says: Ikki, Meelo, you're up. Just lead them through the Bagua circle.
Meelo says: Look to your left! Look to your right! One of those people will not make it out of here alive.

Kai says: Sorry what I've said got you into trouble with your dad.
Jinora says: It's not your fault. He just can't believe that I'm growing up now and I don't need him telling me what to do like one of his recruits.
Kai says:  I know something that'll cheer you up.
Jinora says: Where did all the spirits go?
Kai says: Where are the babies?

Ganbat says: What are these kids doing in my camp?
Rustler #1 says: We caught them sneaking around. Thought they might tell someone we're here.
Ganbat says: They're the new airbenders. Must be living up in the temple. Hurry up and gather the rest of the gang and let's get out of here before someone comes looking for these kids. I'll take them to Ba Sing Se, with the rest of the fresh meat.
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says: Tattoos. How could she think? Focus. Breathe. Bumi ruins everything. Inhale. Focus.
Pema says: Taking a little break from teaching?
Tenzin says: I've failed. Bumi quit, the rest of the airbenders want to go home. Can't they see that I'm trying to rebuild an entire culture?
Pema says: You know, just because these people can airbend, it doesn't automatically make them Air Nomads.
Tenzin says: Tell me about it.
Pema says: I remembered when I moved down my parents' house to become an Air Acolyte. That first night I was so scared and lonely and the bed was so hard.
Tenzin says: It's actually better for your back.  Sorry.
Pema says: The point is: I really wanted to be there, but it still took time for me to adjust to feel like I was a part of it all. The people are probably feeling the same way. You have to be patient.
Tenzin says: Now I know how Korra feels when I'm talking to her.  Thank you, Pema.
</scene>

Tenzin says: Bumi, I want to apologize for losing my patience.
Bumi says:  I'm not talking to you. 
Tenzin says: Hey! Get back here.  Where's Jinora?
Yung says: I saw her fly off on her glider with her boyfriend.
Tenzin says:  What?  Her boyfriend?  Kai!
</scene>

<scene>
Jinora says: How can you steal these bisons? They're endangered.
Ganbat says: Well, that's why they're worth so much. The Earth Queen and her fancy friends pay big money for bison steaks and other rare meats. I even heard she ate her dad's pet bear.
Jinora says: You're disgusting. 
Kai says: Hey, do that spirit beaming thing you did to find me. Go to the temple for help.
Jinora says: I can't. I'm all cramped in here and I need quiet and time to focus. But, maybe I can send a message.  Spirits, I need your help.  Go find Bum-Ju, tell him we're in trouble.
</scene>

<scene>
Bumi says: No, I don't think I should apologize. Tenzin just wants to boss everybody around. I'm too old for that.  Well, let's face it. I'm just not cut out to be an airbender!  Well, that's your opinion.  Wait, Jinora sent this spirit? Is she in trouble?
</scene>

<scene>
Bumi says: Jinora's in trouble. We have to go get her.
Yung says: How do you know?
Bumi says: Bum-Ju's friend told me.
Otaku says: You're able to communicate with the spirits?
Bumi says: More or less, I get the gist. Let's go.
Daw says: Shouldn't Master Tenzin be dealing with this? I don't want to get into trouble
Bumi says: Master Tenzin isn't here. It's up to us. Ikki and Meelo, grab some bison. Airbenders, move out!
</scene>

<scene>
Bumi says: Bison rustlers. They've got Kai and Jinora locked in crates. Looks like they're getting ready to leave, we'll have to move fast.
Daw says: I don't know if I'm ready to get in a fight with some bison rustlers. I can tell without that telescope that they're mean-looking.
Bumi says:  Listen, this is what we've been training for.
Daw says: We haven't been training that long.
Bumi says: That's not important now. Remembered how we persevered together on that obstacle course?
Otaku says: You actually quit.
Bumi says:  Well, I'm not quitting now. I know we've had a tough time, me more than anyone, but we're airbenders, and there aren't many of us so we've got to stick together. They've got two of our own in cages out there, and we're not leaving until we bring them home.
Meelo says: Leave no airbender behind!
Kai says: In. Down. And twist.
Jinora says: Free the bison first.
Bison rustler #2 says:  Hey! What are you doing out?
</scene>

<scene>
Jinora says: Kai!

Tenzin says: What's going on down there?
Jinora says: Kai! Help!
Tenzin says: I'm coming Jinora.
Ganbat says: What the ...
Ganbat says: You got me. I give up.
Kai says:  You think you can kidnap Jinora, and all these baby bisons?!
Tenzin says: Kai, that's enough! An airbender never attacks a defenseless opponent.  But that was very good technique.
</scene>

<scene>
Bumi says: Maybe you boys haven't heard, but there's some new airbenders on these parts. And you never mess with an airbender's bison.
Daw says:  Without my shaved head, I'd never could have dodged that net. I really felt it coming at me. You guys should totally get shaved.
Tenzin says:  I'm proud of you. Your connection with the spirits, natural leadership, you remind me of Dad.
Bumi says: I'm sorry I've been causing you so much trouble. I guess I was just scared of not being able to measure up as an airbender. You know, even though I'm Aang's son, I never really felt that I was a part of the Air Nation before.
Tenzin says:  You are now.
</scene>

<scene>
Kai says: They're so friendly now.
Tenzin says: The bison are the original airbenders. They recognize their own kind.
Jinora says:  I'm sorry for running off.
Tenzin says: I'm just lucky no one's hurt.
Jinora says: I know.
Tenzin says: But I also realized that perhaps I was too harsh on you.
Jinora says: Does that mean I can get my airbender tattoos?
Tenzin says: It's hard for me to believe that my little girl is grown up enough to have her tattoos. I'll promise I'll think about it. Fair enough?
Jinora says: Yeah.
Kai says: Jinora, look. They're flying!
Tenzin says:  I guess everyone is growing up.

Tenzin says: Earth.  Fire.  Air.  Water.  When I was a boy, my father, Avatar Aang, told me the story of how he and his friends heroically ended the Hundred Year War.  Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Zuko  transformed the Fire Nation colonies into the United Republic of Nations,  a society where benders and nonbenders from all over the world could live and thrive together in peace and harmony.  They named the capital of this great land, Republic City.  Avatar Aang accomplished many remarkable things in his life.  But sadly, his time in this world came to an end. And like the cycle of the seasons, the cycle of the Avatar began anew.

Firebending master says:  You're getting ahead of yourself as usual, Korra. We haven't decided if you passed your firebending test yet.
White Lotus leader says: Ever since you were a little girl, you've excelled at the physical side of bending, but completely ignored the spiritual side.  The Avatar must master both.
Korra says:  I haven't ignored it, it just doesn't come as easy to me.  But that's why I should start training with Tenzin immediately.  He's Mister Spiritual.

White Lotus leader says: Do you believe she's ready, Master Katara?
Katara says:  Yes. If anyone can teach her what she needs to learn, it's Tenzin.

Jinora says:  Gran Gran, I've been reading all about your old adventures. I've been dying to ask you: What happened to Zuko's mom?
Katara says: Well, Jinora, it's an incredible tale--
Ikki says:  Gran Gran, you look old. How old are you? And why is it so cold in the South Pole?  Can we make a campfire, and all huddle around it, and tell scary stories, and make snowmen?  And then can you make the snowmen move with waterbending and chase us? Wouldn't that be  fuuun? Huh?  Wouldn't it?
Tenzin says:  Pema, let me help you. Careful now, careful.
Pema says: Stop doting on me. I'm not helpless, I'm just pregnant.

Meelo says:  Mommy, look,  I'm a snowbender!
Pema says:  Were Tenzin and his siblings this crazy when they were kids?
Katara says:  Kya and Bumi certainly were, but  Tenzin has always been ...  rather serious.
Tenzin says:  Mother, please.
Tenzin says: Korra?  Look at you, so big and strong.  You've grown into quite the young Avatar.
Korra says:  Master Tenzin, I'm so glad you're here. I can't wait to get started.
Tenzin says:  Yes, well ... 
Pema says:  You're going to have to tell her sooner or later.
Korra says:  Tell me what?
Katara says:  You're not staying, are you?
Tenzin says:  I'm afraid not. We're only visiting for the night. Then I have to return to Republic City.
Korra says:  But ... no, you're supposed to move here.  You're supposed to teach me.
Tenzin says:  I'm sorry, Korra. Your airbending training is going to have to wait.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  So, how long until you're ready to teach me airbending?  A week? A month?
Tenzin says:  It could be much longer.
Korra says:  I don't understand. Why are you making me wait?
Tenzin says:  I have a responsibility to Republic City. I am one of its leaders, and the situation there is very unstable right now.
Korra says:  But you also have a responsibility to teach me.  Believe me, I'd be happy to find another airbending master, but you're the only one.  We're stuck with each other.
Tenzin says: I wish there were another way.
Korra says:  Wait, there is! If you can't stay here, then I'll go back to Republic City with you! It's perfect!
White Lotus leader says: Absolutely not!  The city is far too dangerous. Avatar Aang tasked us with keeping you safe while you mastered the four elements.
Korra says:  I get that, but I don't think keeping me locked up in this compound like a prisoner is what he had in mind.
Tenzin says:  I know this is difficult to accept, but it's not the right time for you to come to the city.

Korra says:  So there are a lot of you out here? I thought everyone in this city was "living it up".

Protester says:  Oh yeah? Let me guess: you're a bender.
Korra says:  Yeah, I am.
Protester says:  Then I bet you'd just love to knock me off this platform with some waterbending, huh?
Korra says:  I'm seriously thinking about it.
Protester says:  This is what's wrong with this city! Benders like this girl only use their power to oppress us!

Lin says:  Can it!  You should have called the police and stayed out of the way.
Korra says:  But I couldn't just sit by and do nothing. It's my duty to help people.  See, I'm the Avatar.
Lin says:  Oh, I am well aware of who you are.  And your Avatar title might impress some people,  but not me.

Lin says:  That's ancient history.  And it's got diddly-squat to do with the mess you're in right now.  You can't just waltz in here and dole out vigilante justice like you own the place!
Metalbending cop says: Chief,  Councilman Tenzin is here.
Lin says:  Let him in.
Korra says:  Tenzin, sorry ...  I got a little sidetracked on my way to see you.
Tenzin says:  Lin, you are looking radiant as usual.
Lin says:  Cut the garbage, Tenzin. Why is the Avatar in Republic City? I thought you were supposed to be moving down to the South Pole to train her.
Tenzin says:  My relocation has been delayed.  The Avatar, on the other hand, will be heading back to the South Pole immediately, where she will stay put.
Korra says:  But—
Tenzin says:  If you would be so kind as to  drop the charges against Korra, I will take full responsibility for today's regrettable events and cover all the damages.

Tenzin says:  Don't bring my mother into this!
Korra says:  Look, I can't wait any longer to finish my training.  Being cooped up and hidden away from the world isn't helping me become a better Avatar.

Bolin says:  No, I came by to give you my sincere, heartfelt words of encouragement. I know our lives have been moving in two different directions, but I want you to know that I will always be there for you.  We are brothers, after all, even if one of us is a member of high society and the other one is a criminal.
Mako says:  I am not a criminal!
Bolin says:  Of course I know that, but you do kinda look like one, cause you're in a jail and that's where criminals live.
Mako says:  I was set up! Varrick knew I had figured out he was hiring gangsters to pose as Northern soldiers to get Republic City to join the war. That's why he had me arrested.

Mako says:  No! I'm trying to tell you that Varrick isn't what he seems. Where's Asami? She'll listen to me.
Bolin says:  I asked her to come, but she said it was too hard for her. You being in jail like this reminds her of her dad.  Okay, gotta run,  but I'll be back tomorrow. And I am gonna get you the best attorney fame and fortune can buy.
Mako says:  Bolin, wait. If my theory about Varrick is right, something might go down tonight at your premiere. Promise me you'll keep your eyes peeled.
Bolin says:  Yeah, okay, big brother. I promise.  Whew! That insanity defense is definitely gonna work.

Rebel leader says:  Should we wait another day? Korra still might come with reinforcements.
Tonraq says: We can't wait any longer.  It's time to take back what is ours! It's time to take back our city!
Rebels says: Yeah!

Photographer says:  Say "Nuktuk"!
Shiro Shinobi says:  There they are folks. The sweethearts of the big screen, and Republic City's most famous couple, Bolin and Ginger.
Bolin says:  Wow, that was fun! And did you hear what Shiro said? We're Republic City's most famous couple.
Ginger says: Bolin, you're a doll, but you're as dumb as the rocks you bend. We are not a couple.
Bolin says:  That's not what Shiro said!
Lin Beifong says:  Stop stuffing your mustaches with Varri-cakes and get to your post!
Gang says:  You got it, boss.
Lin Beifong says:  You two are the pinnacle of refinement.
Shiro Shinobi says:  This star-studded event just keeps getting star-studdier folks. President Raiko and the First Lady Buttercup Raiko just arrived,  and they're being greeted by entrepreneur extraordinaire Varrick.
Varrick says: There they are, my two most honored guests.  What do you think?  No expense has been spared, I brought in the finest entertainers from Ba Sing Se, and the best food from around the world. Heck! I even had this red carpet imported from the Fire Nation! They make the best red stuff over there. Fact! All right, picture time. 
Raiko says:  Varrick, you didn't have to do all this for us.
Varrick says:  I wanted to. Mister President, I took one look at your wife and I knew that you were a man of exquisite taste.  And that's why I know you're gonna love this mover!
Raiko says: Varrick, I know what you're doing, and I doubt your propaganda is going to change my mind about going to war with the Northern Water Tribe.
Varrick says: Oh, I think you'll be surprised how persuasive I can be.
</scene>

<scene>
Varrick says: Thank you all for  coming for the finale of "Nuktuk: Hero of the South"! You know, when I first started this project there were a lot of naysayers out there. "You can't make pictures move" they said. "You can't take some knucklehead earthbender and make him a star" they said.  "You can't teach a polar bear dog to speak" they said. Well, they're wrong! Thanks to the magic of the movers, our furry friends have found their voices, and you'll be shocked to hear what they have to say.  They speak of the injustice that is happening in the Southern Water Tribe right now.  My hope, is that their words, and this epic mover, will inspire a real life hero to rise up, and help.  Thank you again, enjoy the show! 
Voice narrator says: When last we left our hero, he was captured by the Evil Unalaq's dastardly pet bird.  Amazingly, with the power of his whistling, Nuktuk escaped.  And decided to seek out council.
</scene>

<scene>
Nuktuk says: Thank you, wise sage. I will travel to Republic City and seek help.
</scene>

<scene>
Mover president says: Have a seat, I'm just working on a cure for the common cold. No longer will my citizens suffer from the sniffles.
Nuktuk says: Mister president, there's something more important than the sniffles right now. I need your help to stop the Evil Unalaq.
Mover president says:  Did you say "help"? If there is one thing I love doing, it's helping people.
Buttercup Raiko says:  The seal lion seemed a bit far fetched, but the portrayal of this president is right on the money. 
Asami says: I think this is your best mover yet.
Bolin says:  I just wish Mako was here to see it.

Nuktuk says: Northern Water Tribe automatons! No!
Automatons says: Bee bow bop, Nuktuk cannot stop Unalaq, must destroy Nuktuk.
Nuktuk says:  Haha! Arhg!  Looks like you forgot that water, and automatons, don't mix.
Automatons says: Bee bow bop, oh no, circuits no working. 
Nuktuk says: Hahaho!  We did it! But wait, where's Juji?
</scene>

<scene>
Roh-Tan says: Nuk-no!
Nuktuk says:  You can't die Juji! Not on my watch!
Juji says: It's okay, Nuktuk. At least ... I got to be  your friend.
</scene>

Nuktuk says: Juji!
</scene>

<scene>
Asami says: Are you okay? It seems like this mover is really getting to you. You do know Juji's not really dead?
Bolin says: Of course I know. Juji's fine. He comes back to life in the end when the doomsday device shifts the polarity of the Earth. Oops. Spoiler. Sorry.
Asami says: Then what's wrong?
Bolin says: I guess I just miss my friends. Everything is going so well for me, but it feels empty without everyone around. Korra's gone, Mako's in jail, you're doing ... business-lady stuff. Team Avatar's fallen apart.
Asami says: I know. Things have changed to much since we first met.  Why don't you come back in and finish watching the mover with me?
Bolin says: You go ahead. I need another another minute.  That's weird.

Evil Unalaq says: You're too late Nuktuk.  Soon, my doomsday device will shoot this block of ice into the Earth's core, freezing the entire planet, and I will be ruler of Ice Earth!

Bolin says:  Tell me who sent you!

Lin Beifong says: Varrick's plan was to kidnap you and blame it on the North. Then Republic City would have no choice, but to join the war on the side of the South.
Raiko says: I can't believe Varrick would do something like this, and no one saw it coming.
Lin Beifong says: Actually someone did. Remember Mako?
Raiko says: You got a great officer on your hands.
Lin Beifong says:  He's one of the best.

Ginger says: I can't believe my boyfriend is a real life hero!
Bolin says:  Boyfriend? Wait, stop. I thought you said we weren't a couple.
Ginger says: You really are as dumb as those rocks. Of course we're a couple. 
Asami says: Bolin you saved the president! And you proved Mako was right all along. We have to go tell him what happened.
Bolin says: Yeah!  Oh, you meant right now.
Korra says: President Raiko!
Raiko says: Avatar Korra? What's wrong?
Korra says:  Sir, I know I've asked for your help before, but things have changed. Unalaq doesn't just wanna take over the South anymore. He wants to destroy the whole world.
Bolin says: Unalaq is going to destroy the world? He really does have a doomsday device?
Korra says: He's trying to release a powerful dark spirit during Harmonic Convergence, which is only a few days away. If he succeeds, the world as we know it, is over. Sir, we desperately need your help.
Raiko says: I'm sorry, Korra, but my answer is still no.
Tenzin says:  There are lives on the line! And my daughter is one of them! Raiko, you must reconsider!
Raiko says: I'm aware that lives are on the line. And that's precisely why my troops are staying here. If the world is going to be thrown into chaos as you claim, I need to protect my citizens. I'm sorry.
Bolin says: Sir, Nuktuk needs your help. I know you love helping people.
Raiko says: Son, I appreciate you saving my life and I'm a big fan of your work, but my decision is final. 
Bolin says:  Never should have saved that guy.
Asami says: If you guys need help, I'm here for you.
Bolin says: Yeah, me too.
Korra says: Thank you. It's so good to see you guys again.  Wait. Where's Mako?
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: So, how was the big premiere?
Bolin says: I saved the president, in real life!
Mako says: Wait, wh-what?
Bolin says: You were right about Varrick. He tried to kidnap Raiko!
Mako says: I knew it!
Bolin says: But it didn't work, because of you, and because of me. Let's just say we both did good. Beifong says you're free to go.  Sorry for ever doubting you, Mako.
Mako says:  Don't worry about it bro.
</scene>

Lin Beifong says: Nice job, Mako. You're going to make a great detective.
Gang says: But chief, there aren't any detective openings right now.
Lin Beifong says: Actually we have two openings.

Korra says: Mako, I've missed you so much.
Bolin says: Oh yeah, did I forget to tell you? Korra's back.
Mako says: Korra ... hey, I missed you, too. So you're not still mad at me?
Korra says: Why would I be mad?
Mako says: We had that fight before you left, remember?
Korra says: No, not really. I got attacked by a dark spirit and I lost my memory for a little while. Maybe it hasn't all come back yet. Was it a bad fight?
Mako says:  Uh ...  No. No, it wasn't that bad. 
Tenzin says: Korra, we don't have much time. We need to figure out how to deal with Unalaq.
Bolin says: I think I know just the man to talk to.

Varrick says: Guys, hey,  what do you think? Varrick Industries built this prison, and I had this cell made special. I had a feeling I'd end up here one day.  Zhu Li, c'mon, we got guests!  Whip up a pot of that green tea I love!
Zhu Li says: Yes, sir.
Korra says:  Zhu Li's in prison with you?
Varrick says:  Of course! I don't go anywhere without my assistant. Do you?
Mako says:  We're not interested in your tea. And this isn't a friendly visit.
Varrick says: Don't tell me you guys are still mad about everything that happened. I did some good things, too.  Korra, who warned you about Unalaq?  I did.  Bolin, who got you into the movers?  I did.  Asami, who saved your company?  I did.  Mako, who got you thrown in jail!?  I did!  Oh yeah, guess that was a bad thing.
Asami says: You stole everything from me and you tried to kidnap the president. Those are pretty bad, too.
Varrick says: I wasn't going to hurt him. I just needed to start a war. Well, a bigger war.
Bolin says: Well we're gonna end it. Where's all the stuff you stole from Asami?
Varrick says: The Future Industries' stuff? It's on my battleship.
Korra says: You have a battleship?
Varrick says: Of course I do! I bought the first one they made! Named her the "Zhu Li". 
Bolin says: You named your battleship after your assistant?
Varrick says: Yup. They're both cold, heartless war machines.
Zhu Li says: Your tea, sir.
Varrick says:  Look, I'm truly sorry for the mess I caused. Let me make it up to you,  take Zhu Li.  My battleship, it's yours, and everything on it.
Korra says:  It's not the fleet we were looking for, but it's the next best thing.
Bolin says:  All right! Team Avatar is back in business. Haha!

Tonraq says:  You're no brother of mine. You betrayed me, you had me banished!
Unalaq says:  Yes! I did.
Unalaq says:  Stop! He's mine.
Tonraq says: You are not the true chief.

Now, Team Avatar is in hiding as they await help from General Iroh and the United Forces.

Our great leader has a vision for the future. One day soon, bending will no longer exist and we will live in a world where everyone is finally equal! The United Forces are on their way right now to try and stop that dream. But we will prevail!

Bolin says: You are a wise and noble hobo.  Mmmm. This is the best-tasting street gruel I've ever had. Seriously!

Mako says: I know, we didn't even know each other then. And now, I can't imagine my life without you in it.  You're the most loyal, brave, and selfless person I've ever known.
Korra says:  I think you're pretty incredible too, but ... you already knew that.

Bolin says:  I like this man's confidence! So, how are we not out of the fight?
Iroh says:  A second wave of reinforcements is on the way, but I need to warn them.  Do you still have a way to get a message out?
Korra says: I know just the man for the job.

Iroh says: Commander Bumi.  Second division of the United Forces.
Korra says: Tenzin's brother?
Iroh says: Yes, bit of a wild man, but the bravest commander you'll ever meet.
Gommu says: Ready, sir. 
Iroh says: Fleet ambushed and destroyed by Equalist aircraft. Retreat to Red Sand Island until my signal. Do not approach city until you receive the all clear.  Now comes the hard part. We need to ground those aircrafts. Otherwise, Bumi's fleet would never be able to retake the city.
Mako says:  They flew in from this direction. The airfield must be somewhere over this mountain range.
Iroh says: Everyone get ready, we leave at dawn.
Asami says:  It's time to take down my father. 
Korra says:  Wait, I'm sorry, but I'm not going with you tomorrow.
Mako says: What?
Asami says: Why not?
Korra says: I'm sick and tired of hiding from Amon. It's time I face him.
Iroh says: That's not a good plan. We need to stick together.
Korra says: I'm not waiting for him to hunt me down. My guts tell me it's time to end this, on my terms.
Iroh says: Korra, this is not a mission you should be handling alone.
Mako says: She won't be.  I'm going with you.
Korra says:  You don't have to do that.

Lieutenant says: Well, you're getting transferred again. Amon wants extra security at the arena today.

Korra says: Tarrlok?
Tarrlok says: I don't suppose you're here to rescue me.
Korra says:  We had no idea you were here. Are there other prisoners on the island?
Tarrlok says: No, I'm the only one.
Korra says: And what makes you so special?
Tarrlok says: I'm Amon's brother.  Amon is from the Northern Water Tribe.  He's a waterbender and a bloodbender,  just like I was.
Korra says:  What?
Mako says: Did you know this all along?
Tarrlok says:  No,  not until after he captured me.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: How did your brother end up becoming Amon?
Tarrlok says:  It all began with my father,  Yakone. With the help of his former gang,  he escaped prison and underwent surgery to change his appearance.  He assumed a new identity, and settled down in the Northern Water Tribe.  That's where he met my mother,  a warm, caring woman.  Before long, they started a family together.  Amon was the firstborn, under the name Noatak. I was born three years later.  Noatak was a good-natured kid, always looking out for me. Those were the good years.  Before my brother and I discovered we were waterbenders. At first we were excited by our new abilities, but our training brought out a different side of my father.
Yakone says: Tarrlok, you'd better shape up or you'll be out here in the cold all night until you get it right.
Tarrlok says: I'm trying, but-
Yakone says: Try harder!  Your brother was never this sloppy. 
Noatak says: Dad, he'll get it. He just needs time.
Yakone says: Don't talk back to me, son! Ever!
Tarrlok says:  Even back then, my brother wanted everyone to be treated fairly and equally.  When I was seven, my father took me and Noatak on a hunting trip far away from our home.  He told us his true identity was Yakone, Republic City's most notorious crime boss, and that he was once a bloodbender of rare skill.
Tarrlok says:  What's bloodbending?
Yakone says: The most powerful and feared form of bending in the world. It was declared illegal thanks to that coward, Katara. Our family has the strongest line of bloodbenders in history. You boys have this power inside of you, and I will teach you to master it.
Noatak says:  What happened to your bending, Dad?
Yakone says: The Avatar stole it from me.  That's why I brought you out here, to learn your destiny. You two will become bloodbenders of the highest order. When the time is right, you will claim Republic City and you will destroy the Avatar. You must avenge me. That is your purpose in life.
Tarrlok says:  The good days were behind us.  Every full moon, our father took us on another supposed "hunting trip," where he secretly trained us in bloodbending.  We kept the truth from my mother.
Tarrlok says:  Stop! You're hurting it!
Yakone says: Toughen up, Tarrlok! You'll need a thicker skin for this.  Very good, son, very good.
</scene>

<scene>
Tarrlok says:  A few years later, my father taught us to bloodbend anytime, without the need of the full moon.  We practiced constantly, and I hated every minute of it.  I had no stomach for manipulating helpless animals. My brother, however, seemed to revel in this newfound power.  He was a prodigy, mastering my father's psychic bloodbending technique by the time he was fourteen.
</scene>

<scene>
Yakone says:  That's the way it's done. That's what you need to strive for.
Tarrlok says:  Even though Noatak was my father's favorite, it wasn't any easier for him. He carried the burden of all Yakone's expectations and demands.  Something changed in Noatak over the years;  the loving brother I once knew became cold and detached.  Our father pushed us to extremes, and one day, he made us bloodbend each other.
Yakone says: Noatak, go!  Excellent.  Tarrlok, your turn.
Tarrlok says: No.  I won't do it.
Yakone says:  Bloodbend your brother, Tarrlok!
Tarrlok says: That felt awful. I don't want to do that to anyone. I never want to bloodbend again.
Yakone says: You're a disgrace, a weakling. I'll teach you a lesson, you insubordinate- 
Noatak says:  Stay away from him.
Yakone says: How dare you bloodbend me!
Noatak says: What're you gonna do about it? You're the weak one.  You always say bloodbending is the most powerful thing in the world, but it isn't. The Avatar is. He took your bending away. What could be more powerful than that?
Yakone says: I made you what you are. You're mine.
Noatak says: We're your sons,  not your tools of revenge.  Let's go. We can run away from him.  Forever.
Tarrlok says: Run away? But what about Mom? We can't just leave her.
Noatak says: He was right about you. You are a weakling. 
Tarrlok says: Noatak! Don't leave! Please! Noatak!
</scene>

<scene>
Tarrlok says:  My father and I searched for days, but we never found a sign of Noatak. We thought he perished in that storm. My mother was never the same after the loss of my brother.  My father stopped training me. With Noatak gone, his hopes for revenge withered.  And he passed away, a few years later.
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says: That's one of the saddest stories I've ever heard.
Tarrlok says: Avatar Korra. I am truly sorry for all that I did to you. I thought I was better than my father, but his ghost still shaped me. I became a soldier of revenge, just like he wanted me to be. And so did my brother. The revolution may be built on a lie, but I think Amon truly believes bending is the source of all evil in the world.
Mako says: How did you figure out Amon is your brother?
Tarrlok says: When he took my bending, the sensation was somehow familiar. I later recognized it as my brother's bloodbending grip.
Korra says: So, he somehow uses bloodbending to take people's bending.
Tarrlok says: I don't know how he does it, but then again, I've never encountered a bender as strong as Noatak.
Korra says: How in the world do we beat him?
Mako says: We can't. Any attack we throw at him, he'll redirect with his mind. That's how he's been able to challenge any bender.
Korra says:  So much for our ambush. If we stay here, we're toast. But there's another way to beat him.
Mako says: How?
Korra says: This whole time, Amon has been one step ahead of us. But finally we have the advantage. We know the truth about him. If we expose him as a bender in front of all his supporters ...
Mako says: At the rally.
Korra says: ... We could take away his true power!
Mako says: And undermine this whole revolution!
Korra says:  Thank you, for your help.  We can't just leave him here.
Tarrlok says:  Go. Amon can't know anyone spoke with me.  Defeat him. Put an end to this sad story.

<scene>
Tonraq says: Did you see Zaheer?
Zuko says: The only thing I saw was a snowstorm heading our way.
Tonraq says:  That's not a snowstorm, it's him!
Tonraq says: I put you away once, Zaheer, and I'm going to do it again!
P'Li says: Ming-Hua.
Ming-Hua says: Let's get you out of here.
P'Li says: We could have just taken the elevator.  Show-off.
P'Li says: I've waited thirteen years to feel this warm.
</scene>

<scene>
P'Li says: I thought I'd never see you again.
Zaheer says: I've never doubted it. 
Ghazan says: Really. Right now?

Tu says:  I've got them. These passports should get you into the Upper Ring.
Bolin says: Awesome! Tu, you're the best cousin that I can have.  And my other cousins as well. Yeah. Yeah, you're all the best.
Mako says:  Thanks. I know this wasn't easy.
Yin says: It's such a shame you two must leave so soon.
Mako says: I wished we could stay. But if it's true the Earth Queen is forcing airbenders into her army, we have to do something about it.
Yin says: I love you both. Come visit again. 
Mako says: We will, Grandma.
Bolin says: I love you too, Grandma. And Chow, and Tu, and Meng-Meng, and Chow Jr., there is Big Tee and Little Tee, and Medium Yu, and ... and ... and what was your name again?
</scene>

Korra says: I know that Earth Queen  is lying to me!  I can tell by that stupid little queenly smirk of hers! I can't believe I helped her. I should have known she was using me!
Asami says: Hey, I think I can use a break. You letting off steam is starting to,  hurt. A lot.
Korra says: Sorry.
Asami says: Mako. Bolin. You're okay. Where have you been?
Bolin says:  We chased Kai. Train. Slipped away. Lower Ring. Slept in trash pile. Met our family. Grandma tears. Mako scarf.  Earth Queen. Lying. 
Asami says: Can you interpret that?
Mako says: The Earth Queen's been secretly taking away airbenders and forcing them into her army.
Korra says:  She was lying. I knew it! I swear, the next time I see her-
Asami says:  It's the Queen.
Bolin says:  Quick! Pabu. Shirt.  I know. Sorry. Kinda sweaty.
Hou-Ting says: Good. You're here. Gun, tell them the news.
Gun says: We've received word from the Yang Province. There have been reports of airbenders there.
Hou-Ting says: Wonderful, isn't it? It's the very thing you've been looking for.
Korra says:  Thank you! That is just the most wonderful news. Ever. Yay.
Hou-Ting says: So, I assume you and your  friends here will be leaving immediately.  Is there an animal in my presence?
Gun says: N-no, Your Majesty. I would never allow an animal near you. 
Hou-Ting says:  If I find one within fifty feet of me, it's your head.  Anyway, if you need any assistance packing, let Gun know. He'll see to it that you're on your way by evening.
Korra says: Uhh, this evening? I'm not sure about leaving so soon-
Asami says: Because our airship is having engine trouble. It'll take me until tomorrow to finish the repairs.
Korra says: Thanks for buying us some time.
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says: I can't believe the Earth Queen is conscripting airbenders.
Korra says: Those people should not be forced to join an army!
Bumi says: Well, technically, the Earth Queen has a right to conscript her citizens.  What? It's true.
Jinora says:  Guys, what if Kai was spotted airbending? He might have been taken too.
Bolin says: Probably not. He's surprisingly difficult to catch, like a— like a little, greased hog-monkey.
Jinora says: But, what if he was?
Korra says: Don't worry, Jinora. We'll find him. We just need to figure out where to look.
Mako says: I bet they're under Lake Laogai.  What? I've been reading some of Jinora's books. The old Dai Li agents used to have a secret fortress beneath the lake.
Jinora says: Mako's right! It's the perfect spot to hide airbenders, and I know how to check it out without being caught. I can project my spirit into it!
Bumi says: You mean that out-of-body thing you did to help giant, spirity Korra?
Tenzin says: You can still do that?!
Jinora says: It's not as powerful as it was during Harmonic Convergence, but if I can get close enough, I think I can do it.
Korra says: Let's go get Kai out. Let's get all the airbenders out.

Dai Li sergeant says: You are the property of the Earth Kingdom.  You will become the Earth Queen's elite fighting force and protect her at all cost. It is your duty to serve the Earth Queen.

Yung says: Go easy on me! I'm not that good.
Dai Li sergeant says:  Never show mercy! Now attack your opponent, and this time, like you mean it!
Kai says:  Sorry.
Dai Li sergeant says: A soldier never apologizes to his enemy!
Kai says: I'm not a soldier!
Dai Li sergeant says: You will be when I'm through with you.
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says: If anything goes wrong, come back immediately.
Jinora says: I will.
Korra says: What happened? What did you see?
Jinora says: The airbenders aren't there! It's completely deserted.
Tenzin says: They're not down there?!
Korra says: Jinora, you've read all about Ba Sing Se. Can you think of any other places the airbenders might be?
Jinora says: I guess they could be in the catacombs beneath the Upper Ring, or the ancient sewers beneath the Lower Ring, or the maze of tunnels that connect the rings together, or they could be—
Tenzin says:  There are just too many places. There has to be another way to locate them.
Korra says: Maybe there is.  How did you find me during Harmonic Convergence?
Jinora says: I don't know. I just kind of focused on your energy. I think our spiritual connection led me to you.
Korra says: Maybe you can find Kai the same way. I know you two have a connection.
Tenzin says:  What do you mean "a connection"?
Jinora says: I don't know. Let me try.
</scene>

<scene>
Yung says: Thanks.
Dai Li sergeant says: You again?! If you have time to help your friend, then you're not getting enough rocks for yourself!
Dai Li sergeant says: I guess you're not as good as you thought.
Dai Li sergeant says: Throw him in the hole!
Kai says: Jinora?
Jinora says: It worked!
Kai says: How are you here right now?
Jinora says: Shh, quiet. It's a high-level airbender move. With a little spiritual stuff thrown in.
Kai says:  At first, for a second there, I thought you were a ghost.
Jinora says:  It's good to see you. We've been looking for you and the other airbenders. We're going to get you all out of here. Where are we anyway?
Kai says: Underground somewhere. Other than that, I don't have a clue.
Jinora says: I'll figure it out. Don't worry.
Kai says: Jinora!  Thanks.
Jinora says: The Earth Queen's Temple!

Korra says: I can't believe Miss Queeny Smug Face had them right under our noses the whole time!
Tenzin says: We have to get into that compound tonight and get those airbenders out.
Bumi says: All right. We go in under the cover of darkness: two small insertion teams and a third on the outside. Then all we'll need is twelve tons of blasting jelly, a medium-sized bulldozer and ... does anyone have a badgermole that knows Morse code?
Tenzin says: 
Asami says:  Oh great, not the Queen again.
Korra says: Everyone, act natural. And Bolin -
Bolin says: I'm on it!  What? Hey, I'm not sweaty this time! 
Tenzin says:  Lin? What are you doing here?
Lin says: We need to get Korra out of here immediately. Her life's in danger.
Korra says: What?!  What's going on?
Lin says: I just got word from Lord Zuko and Tonraq.
Korra says: Why is Lord Zuko with my dad?
Lin says: Zaheer and the others have escaped.
Tenzin says: How is that possible?
Lin says: Because Zaheer is an airbender now.
Tenzin says: No ...
Korra says:  All right, hold on! Will you quit ignoring me and tell me what's going on? Who's Zaheer? Why is my life in danger?
Tenzin says:  Shortly after we found out you were the Avatar, Zaheer and three others attempted to kidnap you. Luckily, your father, Lord Zuko, Chief Sokka and I were there to stop them. We apprehended the criminals and locked them away in prisons designed to impair their abilities.
Korra says: So that's why you and my dad sheltered me away.
Tenzin says: It was for your own safety.
Mako says:  Why were they trying to kidnap Korra?
Lin says: We spent thirteen years interrogating them, but they never broke. To this day, no one knows what their motive was.  Now we need to get you back to Republic City, where I can protect you.
Korra says: No ... I'm not running.
Lin says: Korra, you don't understand. These criminals are like nothing you've ever faced before.
Korra says:  Look, I'm not a little kid anymore. You don't need to protect me. I came here for one thing: to find airbenders. And I'm not leaving without them.
Lin says: Fine. Let's get them and get out of here. Where are they?
Korra says: In a military compound, and we're busting them out.
</scene>

<scene>
Jinora says: Hi.
Guard #1 says: Hey! What are you doing here?
Guard #2 says: Oh, it's just that little airbender girl who came with the Avatar. You shouldn't be walking around here all alone.
Jinora says:  I'm not alone. 
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says: Bumi and Korra, come with me to find the airbenders.  You three, find Kai. We'll meet on the surface shortly. Radio us if anything goes wrong.
</scene>

<scene>
Yung says: What's going on? Who are you?
Korra says: I'm the Avatar, and I'm getting you all out of here. 
Tenzin says: Everyone, please! You must stay calm and quiet if we want this to work.
Yung says: What to work?  We're sneaking out?
Korra says: Yes, and we must leave now.
Tenzin says: We're going to get you away from the Earth Queen and out of the city. 
Yung says: There's an airbender that's not here. His name is Kai. We need to get him.
Tenzin says: We're already taking care of it.
Bumi says:  Topside, this is Papa Bear. The breezies are in the hold; cue the balloons!
Lin says:  What? Are you in trouble?
Bumi says: No! We've got the airbenders and we're headed out!  No one likes code names anymore.
Lin says: Copy that. Asami and I are on our way.
</scene>

<scene>
Mako says: Come on. We're getting you out.
Jinora says: Kai! 
Bolin says: Whoa! Tenzin's not gonna be happy about this!
Mako says: Then don't tell him.
Bolin says: How can I not? This is too juicy!
Kai says:  Thanks for coming to get me. I'm really sorry about stealing your wallets, and running away, and getting you stuck on that train.
Bolin says:  We can't stay mad at you.
Mako says: Yes, we can! I had a lot of money in that wallet!
Jinora says: Guys, come on! 
Dai Li sergeant says: Deserting Her Majesty's army is high treason. Punishable by death! 
</scene>

<scene>
Korra says:  Come on! It's clear. 
Hou-Ting says: So, you've discovered my elite army. I see their loyalty still needs some work.
Korra says: These airbenders shouldn't be used as weapons! They have a right to choose their own paths.
Hou-Ting says: These airbenders are Earth Kingdom citizens, and I am their queen. Taking them will constitute an act of war. If you disobey me, I will bear down on you with the entire force of my kingdom!
Korra says: They're leaving with me!
Hou-Ting says: No, they're not!
Bumi says: Come on!
</scene>

Kai says:  I guess I am as good as I thought.

Bumi says: Everyone's in. Let's go!

Tenzin says: Oogi!
Hou-Ting says:  Take down those airships! 
Korra says: Where are the others? 
Bolin says:  We need help!
Bolin says: Everybody, hang on.
Kai says: Whoa, that was awesome!
</scene>

<scene>
Hou-Ting says: Bring me those airships now!  Oh, get it off me!  Get this fur off my- 
</scene>

<scene>
Tenzin says: I know that none of you chose to become airbenders. But now you do have a choice. We can relocate you somewhere safe, or you can come with me to the Northern Air Temple, to live in peace and train as Air Nomads. You are no longer anyone's property. What path you decide is up to you.
Yung says: I want to go with you.
Other airbender #1 says: Me too.
Other airbender #2 says: Count me in.
Korra says: Good luck at the Northern Air Temple. I'll send more airbenders your way when I find them.
Tenzin says: Be careful out there. Stay safe.
Korra says: I'll try. Seems like wherever I go, I make a new enemy.
Tenzin says: But you made some new friends too. You did well, Korra. 
Korra says: This is only the beginning.
