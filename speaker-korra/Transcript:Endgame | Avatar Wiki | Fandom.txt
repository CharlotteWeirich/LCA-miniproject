Iroh	I think we've found our secret airfield.  Bolin, once we get down there, I need you to tear up those runways. We can't let those aircraft take off.
Bolin	 Aye aye, captain!  Ooh, general, general.  All right, you guys wait here until we get back, okay?  Uh-uh, stay.
Asami	 Why would there be fence posts but no fence?
Amon	Thank you all for joining me on this historic occasion!  When I was a boy, a firebender struck down my entire family and left me scarred. That tragic event began my quest to equalize the world.
Korra	That's a lie, Amon!  Or should I call you Noatak? 
Lieutenant	 You want her taken out?
Amon	 No.  Everyone calm down, we have nothing to fear from the Avatar. Let's hear what she has to say.
Korra	Amon has been lying to you. The spirits didn't give him the power to take people's bending away. He uses bloodbending to do it.  Amon is a waterbender! 
Lieutenant	 What is this nonsense?
Amon	 You're desperate, Avatar. Making up stories about me is a pathetic last resort.
Korra	Your family wasn't killed by a firebender.  His father was Yakone,  and his brother ... is Councilman Tarrlok.
Amon	Hmph, an amusing tale, but I will show you the truth.  This is what a firebender did to me.
Korra	 What? 
Korra	I'm telling you! [Pointing at Amon.] He's a waterbender. [She turns to Mako; defeated.] They don't believe me. It didn't work!
Mako	 We said what we had to. Let's get out of here.
Amon	I wouldn't leave yet, Avatar. You'll miss the main event. 
Korra	 No ... they got away.  We saw them get away!
Asami	[Angrily.] Are you insane?! How can we be a family after everything you've done?! Mom would hate you for what you've become.
Equalist	The airplanes are ready for take-off, sir.
Hiroshi Sato	[Turns to Iroh.] That's right, general. I intercepted your message to Commander Bumi. I know exactly where they're hiding. [Iroh glares at Hiroshi.]
Asami	 How are we gonna get out of here?
Iroh	 I don't suppose you know how to metalbend?
Bolin	 That is a negative, Sir. 
Bolin	 Naga! Over here!
Bolin	 Who needs a metalbender?  We got Naga! Yeah!
Iroh	 I'm going after those airplanes.
Bolin	 Ahh! No, Naga!
Asami	 Huh, what do you know ... just like a Future Industries forklift.
Amon	Tonight, I rid the world of airbending, forever. 
Korra	 Amon, let them go!
Amon	 You're welcome to come down here and try to stop me.
Mako	 He's trying to bait you. 
Korra	 I don't care! We have to save them!
Amon	The Avatar needs to be reminded of the power I possess. 
Korra	 Where are Pema and the baby?
Tenzin	 In prison.
Korra	Beifong?
Tenzin	I don't know. 
Korra	 Follow me, kids.
Korra	 Get them out of here. We'll create a diversion. 
Tenzin	 Let's go get your mother and the baby.
Meelo	 Prison break!
Mako	 Let her go!
Korra	No!
Mako	 Korra!
Amon	I told you I would destroy you.
Iroh	 Thanks for looking out for me, Aang.
Bolin	 Whoa! Thanks Naga.
Asami	[Angered.] You don't feel love for Mom anymore. You're too full of hatred.
Hiroshi Sato	[Angrily.] I now see there is no chance to save you!
Bolin	 Mr. Sato, you are a horrible father!
Asami	 You really are a horrible father.
Amon	 Finally, you are powerless.
Lieutenant	 Amon! Everything the Avatar said is true, isn't it? I just saw you bloodbend her.  You traitor! I dedicated my life to you!
Amon	You've served me well, Lieutenant.
Korra	 Mako ... my bending.
Mako	 Everything will be all right! We just need to get out of here.
Amon	 I'm impressed. No one has ever gotten the better of me like that.  It is almost a shame to take the bending of someone so talented. Almost.
Korra	 No!
Amon	 Impossible!
Korra	I - I can airbend?  I can airbend!
Korra	 No ... you ... don't!
Crowd member #2	You bending tyrant!
Protester	 Evil Avatar!
Feathered hat man	He is a bender.
Protester	Whoa!
Crowd member #5	The Avatar was telling the truth.
Tarrlok	Noatak.
Noatak	It's over, brother. I'm sorry for what I had to do to you.
Tarrlok	 Our father set us on this path; fate caused us to collide.  I should have left with you when we were boys.
Noatak	 Leave with me now. We have a second chance. We can start over, together.  Please, you're all I have left in the world.
Lin	 I can't believe Amon got you too.
Bolin	 Hey, at least you unlocked your airbending! 
Mako	Bro, not the time.
Bolin	 Right, right, I'll just stand over here  quietly,  in silence.
Tenzin	 You saved Republic City.
Korra	 But Amon got away. 
Ikki	 Yay, Uncle Bumi's here!
Bumi	 Waaaa-hoooo! 
Tenzin	 Great, now I have to entertain my brother.
Noatak	 The two of us together again, there's nothing we can't do!
Tarrlok	 Yes, Noatak.
Noatak	Noatak. Hmph,  I had almost forgotten the sound of my own name.
Tarrlok	 It will be just like the good old days.
Katara	I've tried everything in my power,  but ...  I cannot restore Korra's bending. 
Lin	 But you're the best healer in the world, you have to keep trying!
Katara	I'm sorry, there's nothing else I can do. Korra can still airbend, but her connection to the other elements has been severed.
Tenzin	It's going to be all right Korra.
Korra	No, it's not. 
Mako	Korra, wait.
Korra	 Go away.
Mako	I will, but I just want you to know, I'm here for you.
Korra	No, I mean, go away, back to Republic City. Get on with your life.
Mako	 What are you talking about?
Korra	I'm not the Avatar anymore. You don't need to do me any favors. 
Mako	 I don't care if you're the Avatar or not. Listen,  when Tarrlok took you I was losing my mind at the thought of never seeing you again, I realized ...  I love you, Korra. 
Korra	 I - I can't. 
Mako	Korra!
Tenzin	 We need to be patient with her. It will take time for her to accept what has happened.
Korra	 Not now Tenzin, I just want to be left alone.
Aang	But you called me here.
Korra	 Aang.
Aang	You have finally connected with your spiritual self.
Korra	 How?
Aang	When we hit our lowest point, we are open to the greatest change.
Korra	 I love you too.
Lin	Thank you. 
Tenzin	I am so proud of you, Avatar Korra.
