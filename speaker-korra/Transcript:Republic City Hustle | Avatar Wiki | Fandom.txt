Bolin	[Running up to her.] Don't worry, I'll catch him. [Runs off after Mako.]
Bolin	 Give it back, you dirty thief.
Mako	 Hey, I stole that fair and square.
Mako	 Ow, stop it.  Ooof. Okay, you win.
Bolin	 Your purse, ma'am.
Bolin	[Loudly in disgust.] Two yuans?! Seriously?! I risked my life for you, [Turns to the side.] as far as you know. [Before she can answer, he grabs a loaf of bread from the woman's shopping bags, and runs away.]
Mako	Nice grab, little brother.
Bolin	 Thanks.  Bread tastes so much better than what we ate yesterday.
Mako	We didn't eat yesterday.
Bolin	 So much better.
Bolin	 Mako! Do you know who that is? It's Toza, legendary earthbending captain of the Boar-q-pines. He's my hero. What do you think he's doing here?
Mako	If you'd stop talking, we could hear.
Shady Shin	[At Bolin and Mako.] Can you believe that ingrate mook?
Bolin	Wow. I mean, I hate to see Toza lose, even if he needs to.
Mako	Why? He got paid. You didn't see any pro-benders crying for us when mom and dad died, and we got dumped on the street. Life is hard. You either hustle or get hustled.
Mako	[To Bolin.] Don't worry, bro. We'll do fine. [Leaves with Bolin.]
Bolin	 Mr. Feeeeng! Hey, you wanna bet on the fight tonight?
Mr. Feng	Oh, thanks for grabbing him, Bolin. [Glaring at Pabu.] He's been trying to escape ever since he figured out I'm going to feed him to the new pythonaconda I just got in.
Bolin	What? You're going to turn him into a snake snack?  Wait, I'll buy him. How much?
Mako	No, the last thing we need is one more mouth to feed.
Bolin	 But it's such a tiny mouth!  Pleeeaase? We can't just leave him for snake food! 
Mako	 Bolin! You have to toughen up!  Big animals eat the little animals, that's just how it goes.  How much do you want to put on the match tonight, Mr. Feng?
Bolin	Hey! Toza! 
Toza	 Oh.  You're the kid who works with the Triple Threats.  What, does Shady Shin want me to belly-flop into the pool so I'm extra humiliated tonight?
Bolin	I just wanted to say, you don't have to throw the fight. I mean ... you're the best!
Toza	 I was the best. But now my body and my bank account are exactly the same: broke.  I made my decision! Leave me alone!
Mako	What are you doing? Are you trying to get us in trouble with Shady Shin?
Bolin	No! I just ... Maybe I'm not as mean as you! Maybe I just can't turn my back on people when they're down!
Bolin	 Little fire ferret.  Helloo?  I got you buddy. Huh, looks like that snake wasn't hungry after all.  I wonder where he iâ€”
Mako	You really have a knack for getting into stupid situations, you know that?
Bolin	 Yeah, thanks Mako.
Mako	C'mon, we should get out of here.
Bolin	No, not without him. 
Mako	All right. But his food comes out of your half.
Bolin	Hooray! You're with us now, Pabu!
Bolin	I named him Pabu.
Mako	How did you come up with that?
Bolin	I don't know. It just kind of came to me while the snake was strangling me. Oxygen deprivation gives you some good ideas.
Shady Shin	[To Mako and Bolin.] All those bets you boys collected for the Boar-q-pines are about to wind up [Bolin hangs his head in sadness.] in our pockets.
Shiro Shinobi	Wait a second folks. [Toza bends two earth discs at the opposing team.] Toza looks like he's suddenly waking up from a bad dream. [Cut to Mako and Bolin, who look on in astonishment.] He's blasting away [Cut to an earth disc hitting the opposing team's waterbender, before switching to the crowd cheering.] just like the championship season 10 years ago. [Cut to earth discs hitting the rest of the opposing team.] The legend's still got it. [Cut to a shot of all three benders falling into the pool.] Knockout!
Bolin	 Yes. He listened to me, Mako. I told him not to throw the fight  and he listened.
Bolin	Oh, well, you know, I'm sure there are other factors.
Toza	I am an honorable man. I just needed someone [Looks in Bolin's direction.] to remind me. [Throws a pile of yuans at Shin's feet.] Here's your money back. Now get out of my gym.
Toza	[Reaches out to stop the two brothers as they leave.] Wait. You guys have got some real bending skills. With a little training, I think you could go pro. I could teach you everything I know.
Toza	[To Mako.] I could find you a place to stay right here in the arena. Who knows, you could be champs. At least it's a chance at an honest living.
Bolin	 Can we, Mako? Mako, can we please?
Mako	[Looks across at his brother's hopeful face.] Sorry Shady, but you're right. I do have to take care of my brother, and I think this is what's best for him.
Bolin	I'm so glad we're not criminals anymore. Lets celebrate over dinner.
Mako	Err, I think we better save our money.
Bolin	Oh, I have lots of money coming. I bet everything we had on the Boar-q-pines.
Mako	What?! But you knew the fight was fixed.
Bolin	What can I say?  I had a good feeling.
