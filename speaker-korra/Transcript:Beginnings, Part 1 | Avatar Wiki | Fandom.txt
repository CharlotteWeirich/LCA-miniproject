Korra	[Weakly.] Raava. Raava. Raava.
Shaman	 A dark energy has infected her. We must purge it before it destroys her Avatar Spirit.  Let the waters cleanse the darkness that plagues your spirit.
Korra	Who are you?
Korra	Who am I?
Korra	I don't know what that is.
Kyoshi's image	[Roku's image ripples and changes into Kyoshi's.] If you don't, darkness will engulf the world. You will die, and our era will end.
Korra	How do I regain my connection?
Korra	[Turns around and sees Wan in front of a circle of light. Cut back to a frontal shot of Korra.] Are you Raava?
Little Chou	[Raises his spear.] Nobody steals from the Chou brothers!
Wan	Really? Because I just did.
Wan	[Wan turns around to salute the brothers mockingly before letting himself fall backward, off the railing.] Actually, I feel quite alive.
Wan	[The Chous catch up with Wan, who is seen in the reflection of Big Chou's blade.] He-he-hey, fellas! [Looks at his roll sadly for a moment.] You're just in time for lunch! [Throws a piece of food in Big Chou's face leaving a red mark on his nose and jumps over him, but is tripped by Middle Chou, subsequently falling on the ground.]
Jaya	[Sighs while Wan walks in, digging into his shirt to take out some food.] Did you steal from the Chous again?
Wan	 Yeah, and I got to nothing show for it except a few dirty rolls and a whole lot of bruises.  Hey, Yao, I got some food for you. 
Yao	Mmm. Delicious!  Thank you, Wan.
Wan	You guys are hungry too, huh? 
Jaya	Wan, you should eat.
Wan	 They need it more than I do.  Besides, I'm tired of eating scraps.  If only there was some way to get into the Chous' food cellar. We'd be eating like, well, like Chous.
Jaya	If Chou the Elder catches you sneaking into his palace, you'll end up dead. Or worse, he'll banish you to the Spirit Wilds.
Yao	No, don't get banished.  You don't want nothing to do with those spirits. They'll get inside ya, scramble up your mind, turn you into this , a monster! 
Jaya	Don't do anything crazy, Wan. You just gotta accept the world is the way it is. Some people have power. Some people don't. And you don't.
Wan	 Not yet, anyway.
Huntsman	Are you strong?  Are you fearless? Do you have what it takes to battle the spirits? Then join the hunt.
Wan	Count me in. 
Huntsman	We're going to be out in the wilds for a week. You wouldn't last two seconds.
Wan	 I can handle myself.  We all get fire, right?
Huntsman	Yeah, but do you know how to use it?
Wan	Well, not exactly, but I-
Huntsman	[Smiles.] All right. Welcome to the hunt.
Wan	 The lion turtle.
Huntsman	Great guardian of our city, we are venturing into the Spirit Wilds to bring back food for our people. Please, grant us the power of fire.
Huntsman	You're first, kid.
Huntsman	Just make sure you aim at the spirits, not us, okay?
Wan	Sure thing.
Huntsman	Everyone, stay close. Spirits love to pick off stragglers.
Wan	Uh, guys?  I don't think I can do this.
Huntsman	Now, quit your whining. We haven't even seen a spirit yet.
Wan	 I think I wanna go home.
Huntsman	 I knew you were nothing but a sniveling coward. Go give your fire back to the lion turtle,  and don't ever show your face around me again.
Jaya	Wan, you're back.
Yao	 What goodies did you snatch for us this time?
Jaya	 What did you do? You can't steal from the lion turtle.
Wan	 Really?  Because I just did. 
Jaya	 You know it's forbidden to bring the power of the element into the city. Please, go back to the lion turtle and return the fire.
Wan	Jaya, it's time to stop being so afraid of the Chous and show them we have the power to change things.
Wan	Hey, Chous! Open the gate, and let us in.
Big Chou	Don't worry father. We'll take care of them.
Wan	 Hand over all the food you're hoarding,  and we won't give you any trouble.
Wan	[Frontal shot as Wan crosses his arms; smugly.] Powerless, huh?
Wan	 Follow me!
Wan	 Grab as much food as you can. 
Jaya	 Maybe you're right.  Maybe we do have the power to change things.
Jaya	[Voice-over.] Looks like the Chous found backup.
Wan	 Get everyone out of here. I'll hold them off.
Little Chou	Wan?
Chou the Elder	Tell me who else was involved in the rebellion, and I might take mercy on you.
Wan	 I'm not telling you anything.
Little Chou	Yeah! [The guards start to push Wan toward the lion turtle.] And give back the fire you stole.
Wan	No! Wait. Great lion turtle, I am sorry for stealing the fire from you, and I accept my punishment. But please, I need to be able to protect myself in the wilds.
Yao	[Sadly.] Bet he doesn't last [Jaya turns and looks at Yao.] till morning.
Wan	Who said that?
Wan	[Cut back to Wan who sighs in relief.] You're just a little frog.
Wan	[Surrounded by buzzing hornets; running in zig-zags all over the place.] Get off me! Get off me!
Wan	Please, help me. I'm starving and I haven't slept all night.
Wan	[Firebends at the spirit.] Let me pass. [The spirit widens his eyes in surprise for a moment before turning angry.]
Aye-aye spirit	And who might you be?
Wan	 I am Bushy, the Bush Spirit. And I would like the enter your oasis.
Wan	[Cut to a shot of Wan sitting in the water, soaked, as his disguise scatters.] Come on, let me in, just for a little while.
Wan	Believe me, I'd love to go back home. But I can't. I was kicked out.
Friendly spirit #2	Poor human.
Wan	Who are you calling ugly, Ugly?
Friendly spirit #1	If you can't go back to your city, then you should go live in another one.
Wan	 What? There are other lion turtles?
Wan	So which way to the nearest lion turtle city?
Wan	Real funny. You know what? I don't need your help. I'll find it myself.
Wan	[Sighs. Cut to a shot from the side as Wan walks toward the cat deer as it growls once more.] It's okay. I'm gonna get you out of there.
Huntsman	Finally, we caught something.  Get it down.
Wan	Back off.
Huntsman	Wan? What are you doing here?
Wan	I'm saving this animal.
Huntsman	That animal's our dinner. Now, get out of the way.
Wan	No!
Hunter #4	[Swarmed by insects.] Get 'em off! Get 'em off! [He is dragged off into the air.] Ahh!
Huntsman	Well, looks like you're all out of tricks, Wan.
Huntsman	[Is assaulted by his possessed comrade.] No, no! [Runs away screaming.]
Wan	I feel great. What's in this water?
Wan	[Friendly spirit #2 hands Wan a piece of fruit.] Thanks. [Wan takes a bite out of the fruit.] So what did you do to that hunter?
Wan	Thanks for saving my neck. But why'd you do it?
Wan	Told you I wasn't like the others. [Pets Mula and stands up.]
Friendly spirit #2	Are you off to find another lion turtle city?
Wan	I was. But I think I've had enough of humans for a while. I've decided to stay here and learn the ways of the spirits.
Friendly spirit #2	That'll be fun.
Wan	First time for everything, right?
Wan	The name is Wan.
Citizen #1	What happened in the wilds?
Huntsman	Gone. Spirits took them. [As the huntsman speaks, the camera zooms out to reveal Jaya and Yao watching in the foreground. Cut to a shot of the two from the front, looking amazed.] They were protecting that kid, Wan, like he was one of their own.
Jaya	 Did you hear that?  Wan's still alive.
Huntsman	 And the way Wan moves fire, it's like nothing I've ever seen.  He uses it like it's an extension of his body.
Jaya	 Wan has proved that with the power of fire, anyone can survive in the wilds.  We don't have to live under Chou the Elder's rules anymore, so I say we leave this city and start over.  Who's with me?
Wan	 You ready to go, Mula?
Wan	Yes. It's time I see the rest of the world and find the other lion turtle cities.
Wan	[Chuckles lightly.] Thank you for everything. [Cut to an aerial shot of the oasis; voice-over.] Goodbye, everyone.
Random spirit #1	The all-powerful spirits are battling!
Wan	Stop, or you'll destroy everything!
Raava	This doesn't concern you, human!
Wan	It does when the lives of spirits and animals are in danger.
Vaatu	If you're a friend to spirits, then use your fire to help me break free.
Raava	Don't involve the human. This is between us.
Vaatu	Please, save me. She has tormented me for ten thousand years.
Wan	 Ten thousand years?  Let him go!
Vaatu	Thank you, human. You have performed a great service for the spirits. 
Raava	 Do you realize what you've done?
Wan	Yeah, I helped a spirit who was being bullied by you.
Raava	You are gravely mistaken. I was keeping him under control.
Wan	 And what gives you the right?
Raava	You don't even know who I am, do you?
Wan	Should I?
Raava	Yes. My name is Raava.  That spirit you freed is Vaatu.  He is the force of darkness and chaos. I am the force of light and peace. Since the beginning of time, we have battled over the fate of this world.  And for the past ten thousand years, I have kept darkness under control and the world in balance,  until you came along.
Wan	 So, by freeing Vaatu, I let chaos into the world?
Raava	 Precisely. The human and spirit realms are headed toward annihilation,  and it's all your fault.
Korra	 Raava.  I found you.
