Tenzin	Earth. Fire. Air. Water. Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
Korra	 And, in the final round, the Buzzard Wasps  won with a decisive knockout!  What do you say we go to the arena tonight,  catch a few pro-bending matches?
Tenzin	 That sport is a mockery of the noble tradition of bending. 
Korra	Come on, Tenzin! I've dreamed about seeing a pro-bending match since I was a kid  and now I'm just a ferry ride away from  the arena.
Tenzin	 Korra, you're not here to watch that drivel. You're here to finish your Avatar training.  So, for the time being, I want you to remain on the island.
Korra	 Is that why you're keeping the White Lotus sentries around,  to watch my every move?
Tenzin	Yes. In order to learn airbending I believe you require a calm,  quiet environment, free from any distractions.
Korra	 All right,  you're the master.
Tenzin	So, my mother informed me that  you've never been able to airbend before.
Korra	 Yeah, but I don't know why. The other elements came so easily to me,  but every single time I've tried airbending-  nothing.
Tenzin	 That's perfectly all right. You just need to be patient.  Often the element that's the most difficult for the Avatar to master is the one most opposite to the Avatar's personality.  For Aang, it was earthbending.
Korra	 Yeah. Well, I'm about as opposite an airbender as you can get.
Tenzin	 Let's begin your first lesson.
Ikki	 Korra's gonna airbend! Korra's gonna airbend!
Korra	 What is that contraption?
Tenzin	A time-honored tool that teaches the most fundamental aspect of airbending. Jinora, would you like to explain this exercise?
Jinora	 The goal is to weave your way through the gates and make it to the other side without touching them.
Korra	 Seems easy enough.
Ikki	 Jinora forgot to say that you have to make it through while the gates are spinning.
Tenzin	 The key is to be like the leaf.  Flow with the movement of the gates.  Jinora will demonstrate.
Tenzin	 Airbending is all about spiral movements. When you meet resistance, you must be able to switch direction at a moment's notice.
Korra	 Let's do this!
Jinora	 Don't force your way through!
Ikki	 Dance! Dance like the wind!
Meelo	 Be the leaf!
Korra	Airbend!  What is wrong with me? Airbend!
Korra	 Aargh!  Maybe I'm just not cut out to be an airbender, huh, Naga?
Shiro Shinobi	This Mako's got moxy! He advances, fires two quick shots. [Close-up of the excited White Lotus sentries.] Yomo is hammered back to zone three! [Close-up of an equally excited Korra.] Clock is winding down, can Yomo hold on? [Close-up of the sentries as they squish their faces together with wide eyes to be closer to the radio.] He's teetering on the edge of the ring now. [Back to Korra with a wide grin and clenched fists. The view briefly shows the radio's lit dial. Camera zooms in on the lit radio frequency as the excitement and tension is building.] The Fire Ferrets line up to strik-
Tenzin	 Korra, come down here please.
Korra	 You shut it off at the best part!
Tenzin	 I thought I made myself clear. I don't want you listening to this distracting nonsense.
Korra	 But it's their radio. And technically, you said I couldn't watch a match.  You didn't say anything about listening to one.
Tenzin	 You-  ... you know what I meant!  Anyway shouldn't y-? Shouldn't you be in bed by now?
Korra	 I think I'm doing it wrong.
Tenzin	 There's nothing to do. Let your mind and your spirit be free,  for air is the element of freedom.  Is something ... funny?
Korra	 Yeah, you're telling me to embrace freedom, but you won't even let me listen to the radio. And forget about leaving this island!
Tenzin	 Please, Korra.  Look at Meelo; he's able to meditate peacefully.
Korra	Actually, I think he's asleep.
Tenzin	 What? Well, at least he has the relaxing part down.
Korra	 Whatever. None of this airbending stuff makes any sense to me.
Tenzin	 I know you're frustrated, but these teachings will sink in over time. Then one day, they'll just click. 
Korra	 Yeah, it's not sinking in yet.  I'm gonna go get a glass of lychee juice.
Tenzin	 Korra, the meditation's not over yet!
Ikki	 Daddy, can I have some lychee juice too?
Tenzin	 No.
Toza	 Hey,  what're you doin' in my gym?
Korra	 Uh, I was just looking for a bathroom and I got lost.
Toza	" Ah, the old ""I had to pee"" excuse!  You know, I'm sick and tired of you kids sneakin' in without payin'!  I'm taking you to security!"
Korra	No, wait!
Bolin	 There you are! I've been looking everywhere for you!  It's all right Toza,  she's with me.
Korra	 Yeah, I'm with him.
Bolin	So, you see, we're together.
Korra	 Well, not together together, more like friends.
Bolin	Right, friends.  No, no, I didn't mean to imply. 
Korra	 Oh, you implied it.
Toza	 Ah, I don't care what you are! I got work to do.
Bolin	Rrright this way, miss.
Korra	And thank you, sir!  Seriously, thanks.
Bolin	Whaddya think? Best seats in the house, huh?
Korra	 Whoa! Unbelievable!  This place is even more amazing than I imagined!
Bolin	Name's Bolin, by the way.
Korra	 Korra.
Mako	 Psst,  Bolin.
Bolin	Yeah?
Mako	 I told you, you have to stop bringing your crazy fangirls in here before the matches. Get her out of here.
Bolin	 Come on, Mako! Right, look, I kinda promised her she could stay,  but man, I got a good feeling, there's somethin' special about her. I know it!  Come here, I want you to meet my brother, Mako.
Korra	 Mako? Wow, I-I heard you playing on the radio.
Mako	 Come on, Bolin, we're up.
Korra	 ... or I could meet him later.
Bolin	 Yeah, sorry about that. My brother just gets real ... focused before a match.  Okay, I gotta go, wish me luck.  Not ... that I'll need it.
Korra	 Good luck.  Knock 'em out!
Fangirl	[Screaming.] Aaaaaah! I love you, Bolin! Aaaaaah!
Shiro Shinobi	[Voice-over.] And they're off! The two teams waste no time trying to blast each other out of zone one!
Shiro Shinobi	[Voice-over.] Oooh, the Tigerdillos score with a walloping one-two combo!
Korra	[Raises fist.] Come on, Ferrets!
Shiro Shinobi	Assuming the fabulous bending brothers can hold their ground until the next round.
Announcer	 Round one goes to the  Golden Temple Tigerdillos!
Mako	 Come on, Hasook! Get your act together!
Shiro Shinobi	[Voice-over.] The Fire Ferrets cinch the round in the closing seconds! It's one apiece, [Switch to a divided close-up: the Tigerdillos at the left and the Fire Ferrets at the right.] still anyone's match as we go into the third and final round!
Korra	[Clutching her head; in despair.] Oh, no!
Shiro Shinobi	[Voice-over.] It's a knockout! What a wing-dinger of a hat trick, folks! [The score board lights up, showing that the Fire Ferrets won with a knockout.] Mako pulls off the upset of the season, winning the match for the Fire Ferrets!
Bolin	Woohoo! Yes!  One more win and we're in the championship tournament!  So, what'd ya think, Korra? Bolin's got some moves, huh?
Korra	 What did I think? What did I think? That was am​azing!
Mako	 You did more harm than good out there. You almost cost us the match!
Hasook	 We won, didn't we?
Mako	Barely!
Hasook	 Get off my case, pal!  Ugh! 
Mako	 Useless.
Korra	 You guys were incredible out there!  Especially you, Mr. Hat Trick!
Mako	 Oh, you're still here?
Korra	 Oh, you're still a jerk?
Bolin	Ooh! 
Korra	 Anyway,  I've been immersed in bending my entire life, but I never learned how to move like that! It's like there's a whole new style here!  Think you could show me a few tricks?
Bolin	Ab-so-lutely!
Mako	 Right now? Come on, Bolin.
Bolin	 Just ignore him.  Yeah, I could show you the basics.  I'm just not sure how my earthbending would translate to your waterbending,  but we'll figure it out.
Korra	 Won't be a problem.  I'm actually an earthbender.
Bolin	 I'm sorry, no, no! I didn't mean to assume. 'Cause I, you know, I was just figuring ... with your Water Tribe getup ... that you are ... a Water Tribe ... gal.
Korra	 Nope, you're right. I'm a waterbender. And a firebender.
Bolin	 Mm. Mm-hmm. I'm very confused right now.
Mako	 You're the Avatar,  and I'm an idiot.
Korra	 Both are true.
Bolin	 No ... way.  Th​e Avatar!
Bolin	 All right! Let's see what'cha got!
Bolin	That was great! Good power! But in a real match, you'd be a sitting turtle duck.  Not so upright and flatfooted!  Stay light on your toes, right up until the moment when you need to dig in and strike. Then ...  pop, pop!
Korra	 Okay, let me try it again.
Bolin	 Wow! Nice adjustment!  You're a natural at this.
Mako	 Not bad.
Korra	 What's it take to impress this guy?
Mako	" What? I said ""not bad"".  You know what, it's getting late.  I think I'm gonna turn in. You kids have fun.  Nice to meet you, Avatar Korra."
Korra	 Yeah, been a real pleasure.
Mako	 See ya upstairs, bro.
Korra	Upstairs?  You guys live here?
Bolin	 Yup. In the attic. It's nothin' fancy, but we have some great views!  So, back to bending. Why don't you throw that combo one more time?
Tenzin	 Patience, Korra!
Tenzin	 That was a two-thousand-year-old historical treasure!  What ...  What is wrong with you?!
Korra	 There's nothing wrong with m​e! I've been practicing just like you taught me, but it isn't sinking in, okay?  It hasn't clicked like you said it would!
Tenzin	 Korra, this isn't something you can force. If you would only listen to me ...
Korra	 I have been! But you know what I think? Maybe the problem isn't me! Maybe the reason I haven't learned airbending yet is because  you're a terrible teacher!
Meelo	 Yeah! You're a terrible teacher, Daddy!
Pema	 Okay! Everyone here?  Wait. Where's Korra?
Tenzin	 Honestly, Pema, I am at my wit's end with that girl! I ... I don't know how to get through to her!
Pema	 Dear, the best thing you can do right now is to give Korra some space.
Tenzin	 You must promise me that your teenage years won't be like this!
Jinora	 I will make no such promises.
Korra	 I didn't miss your match, did I? You guys look like you lost already.
Bolin	 We might as well have.
Mako	 Hasook's a no-good no-show!
Referee	 You got two minutes to come out ready to play, or you're disqualified. 
Mako	 Well, there goes our shot at the tournament ... and the winnings.
Korra	 Can't you ask one of those guys to fill in?
Bolin	Nah. The rules say you can only compete on one team.
Korra	Well, then ...  how about me? I'm a top-notch waterbender,  if I do say so myself.
Bolin	But, you're the Avatar.  Isn't that cheating?
Korra	 It isn't cheating if I only do waterbending.
Mako	No way. I'd rather forfeit than look like a fool out there.
Korra	 Wow, thanks for the vote of confidence.
Referee	 Time's up. You in or out?
Korra	 We're in!
Mako	 We are?
Bolin	 Yes!
Mako	 Hey, I didn't agree to this!
Korra	You can thank me later. 
Mako	 This girl is crazy.
Mako	[Close side shot of the Fire Ferrets as the teams take on a fighting stance.] Don't do anything too fancy or aggressive. [Looks at Korra.] In fact, don't do anything. Just try not to get knocked off the ring.
Korra	You got it, captain.
Referee	 Players! Are you ready?
Korra	 Woohoo! Man overboard!
Referee	 Fire Ferret waterbender, penalty! Move back one zone!
Korra	 What? Why?
Mako	 You're only allowed to knock players off the back of the ring! Not over the sides!
Korra	 Oh. Whoops.
Referee	[Blows whistle and points.] Foul! Over the line! Move back to zone three!
Korra	 Urgh!  I'll show you over the line!
Shiro Shinobi	[Voice-over.] Wait a minute! Did that waterbender just earthbend?
Referee	 Foul! I ... think.
Tenzin	[Frontal shot of the guards all looking bewildered.] Pardon me, everyone, have you seen Korra this evening? She's not in her room.
Tenzin	[Angrily.] I'll get her myself!
Referee	 The Avatar will be permitted to continue so long as she solely bends water!
Shiro Shinobi	[Voice-over.] This girl may be the Avatar, but she's no pro-bender and the Platypus Bears are intent on exploiting that weakness!
Shiro Shinobi	[Voice-over.] Aaaaand she's in the drink.
Korra	 Oh, hey, Tenzin. I thought you didn't like coming to these matches.
Tenzin	Once again, you have flagrantly disobeyed my orders. You were to stay on the island! Let's go.
Korra	 No! I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Tenzin	 I have tried my very best to get through to you by being gentle and patient,  but clearly the only thing you respond to is force! So I am ordering you to come back to the temple right now!
Korra	 Why? So I can sit around and meditate about how bad I am at airbending?  You know, I'm beginning to think there's a reason I haven't been able to learn it! Because, maybe, I don't even need it!
Tenzin	What? That is a ludicrous suggestion!  The Avatar needs to learn airbending! It is not optional!
Korra	 No! This is what I need to learn! Modern styles of fighting!
Tenzin	 Being the Avatar isn't all about fighting, Korra!  When will you learn that?
Korra	 I have a match to go finish.
Shiro Shinobi	[Voice-over.] The Platypus Bears come out of the gate and quickly go after the Ferret brothers! They're corralled in the corner, wedged in the edge of zone one, unable to come to the Avatar's rescue! And boy, does she need it!
Shiro Shinobi	[Voice-over.] It's only a matter of time before ...
Tenzin	[Dumbfounded.] How about that?
Shiro Shinobi	[Close-up.] Knockout!
Tenzin	Woohoo!
Korra and Bolin	Hahaha, yeah! Yes!
Mako	 Korra ... what can I say? You really came alive in that last round. The way you dodged their attacks ... you are a natural.
Korra	Thanks, but I can't take all the credit.  Someone else taught me those moves.
Korra	 I'm really sorry ... about everything I said.  I was really frustrated with myself,  and I took it out on you.
Tenzin	 I think I owe you an apology too. I was trying to teach you about patience, but I lost mine.
Korra	 No hard feelings?
Tenzin	 Of course not. By the way, you were really good out there tonight.  You moved just like an airbender!
Korra	 Wait ...  You stayed and watched?
Tenzin	 I did. Pro-bending turned out to be the perfect teaching tool for you.
Korra	 I'll see you tomorrow for airbending practice, bright and early!  And, by the way, I kinda permanently joined the Fire Ferrets and we're playing in the tournament in a couple of weeks!
