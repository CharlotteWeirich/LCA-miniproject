Vaatu	 Raava,  nothing could stop this moment. Harmonic Convergence is upon us again.
Korra	 I'm not going to let you fuse with Unalaq. You're going right back in that prison.
Korra	 Don't let Unalaq back in the Spirit World.
Bolin	 We're on it.
Bumi	Jinora. Jinora's spirit do you hear me?  It's your Uncle Bumi.
Tenzin	 Ah, this isn't working. We can't just randomly wander the Spirit World, call out for Jinora, and expect to find her.
Bumi	We just need to employ the simply rules of tracking.  First we locate her footprints ... then we follow them.
Kya	 Do you even know what spirit footprints look like? Do spirits even leave footprints? Face it, your tracking skills won't work in the Spirit World.  Let me try something.  Jinora is over there.  I feel a lot of spiritual energy coming from that direction.
Bumi	We're in the Spirit World. There's spiritual energy in every direction.
Tenzin	Enough!  We can't do this by ourselves. We need a spirit guide.
Tenzin	 There.  Spirit, hello.  I'm sorry to disturb you, but I am in need of your assistance.
Bumi	[Brushing off dust.] Well, that didn't work. Now where are we?
Tenzin	We're completely lost.
Korra	No!
Bolin	I don't know if we can win this fight.
Mako	We don't need to win, we just need to stop Unalaq from getting back in the Spirit World.
Tenzin	 We're walking in circles,  I've seen that same spirit mushroom five times.
Bumi	That's not the same mushroom.
Tenzin	See? Even it knows we're lost. [Facepalms.]
Bumi	 Oh sure, listen to a fungus over your own brother.
Kya	 What's that?
Bumi	Mushroom? Is that you?
Bumi	Iroh?!
Tenzin	How ...? Where ...? It's been so long.
Iroh	Almost forty years. It's nice to see you again.
Tenzin	How did you know we were here?
Iroh	 My friendly spirit fox told me you were lost, I came to show you the way out.
Tenzin	Iroh, we are grateful, but we're not looking for the way out. We're looking for my daughter.
Iroh	I'm sorry to hear that. But you shouldn't be here, Vaatu has escaped and darkness threatens to take over.
Tenzin	I'm not leaving until I find Jinora.
Iroh	I understand. But I beg you to be careful, if you travel too deep into the Spirit World, you could end up in a place where only the lost will ever find you.
Tenzin	A place where only the lost can find you ...? That's it! I know where to find Jinora!
Korra	 I'm locking you away for another ten thousand years, Vaatu!
Bolin	Unalaq?  Are you out there?  He must've gone home?
Eska	Hello, my feeble turtle duck.
Unalaq	 Don't let them escape this time.
Bumi	Are you this is the best way to find Jinora?
Tenzin	Trust me.  Hey you! Spirit! Wake up!
Kya	I thought we were gonna be taken to a prison?
Tenzin	This is a prison.
Eska	Stop!
Korra	No!
Unalaq	We are now one! Now a new era for spirits and humans will begin! And I will lead them all as the new Avatar!
Korra	 Well I'm the old Avatar, and my era's not over yet!
Bumi	What kind of prison doesn't have any bars or walls? We can walk right out of here.
Tenzin	The Fog of Lost Souls is a spirit prison for humans. I read about that in ancient text. The fog is actually a spirit  that infects your mind and slowly drives you mad, imprisoning you in your own darkest memories.
Kya	 How long can we be trapped in here? 
Zhao	I am Zhao the Conqueror.  I am the Moon Slayer. I will capture the Avatar.  I am Zhao the Conqueror.  I am the Moon Slayer. I will capture the Avatar.
Kya	Hopefully we're not trapped in here as long as that guy.
Zhao	 You, you're him. The last airbender! 
Tenzin	 Ah, no! Get off me! 
Zhao	You've grown. But I will still defeat you.  Come back Avatar. Face me! I am Zhao the Conqueror. I will capture you! Victory will be mine!
Tenzin	If we stay together, we'll find Jinora and make it out of this fog.
Unalaq	Give in. Your time is over!
Raava	Korra, this fight is not over.
Korra	Raava.
Raava	Vaatu cannot win. Do not give in to ten thousand years of darkness. You are the Avatar.
Korra	You cannot win.
Tenzin	Jinora! Jinora!
Bumi	Wait a second.
Tenzin	What, do you hear something?
Bumi	 Yes. They're all around us. The cannibals, they're everywhere.
Tenzin	Bumi, you must focus your mind. Right now! There are no cannibals. 
Bumi	Yes, there are! They're gonna eat every last one of us!
Kya	 Who are you two? 
Tenzin	 Kya, we're your brothers. You must remember, before the fog infects you.
Kya	No, you're just a vision. I have no family. You can't tie me down.
Bumi	They're closing in! I gotta get out of here!
Tenzin	No! Bumi! Kya! Come back!
Mako	Please, let us out.
Desna	His grovelling is pathetic.
Eska	But I do enjoy the sweet scent of desperation.
Mako	Come on, your dad has become an evil monster. He's gonna bring on eternal darkness. Why would you protect someone who doesn't care about you at all?
Desna	 Father was going to let me expire when we tried to open the northern portal. Perhaps we should rethink our position.
Mako	Yes!
Eska	No. Don't listen to him. His words are poisoning your mind.  What's with this outburst of emotion?
Bolin	 I'm sorry, I can't help it. It's just so sad that I'll never be with you again.
Eska	What? Explain yourself further.
Bolin	Eska, I've always loved you. And I always wanted to be with you. But now that the world is ending,  I'm never gonna get that chance.
Eska	 We could have been together, but you left me at the altar.
Bolin	No, I was scared. I was scared of my true feelings for you. Gah, I should have never left you. I'm sorry. And I'm sorry that we'll never have the chance to rekindle the dying ember that was our love into a big fire of love flames.
Eska	You'll never defeat my father. But, should you survive, perhaps we could spend eternal darkness together.
Mako	Wow! That was the best acting I've ever seen. You completely fooled her.
Bolin	 Yeah right, huh. That was acting. 
Desna	They will certainly perish.
Tenzin	You must stay focused. Remember who you are Tenzin. You are the son of Avatar Aang. You are the hope for future generations of airbenders. The fate of the world rests on your shoulders. But what if I fail?  Then your father's hopes of the future dies with you. I can't fail. You will.  Ah, stop it! I am the son of Avatar Aang. I am the hope for future generations of airbenders. I am the son of Avatar Aang. 
Tenzin	Dad, [Sadly.] I've failed you. I am no spiritual leader, and I've let the world down. I'll never be the man you were.
Tenzin	I am not a reflection of my father. I am Tenzin. [With his reflection.] I am Tenzin!
Tenzin	Jinora!
Bumi	 Huh? What happened?
Kya	I think our brother saved us.
Jinora	Dad. 
Tenzin	You'll be okay sweetie. I'm here.
Jinora	 What happened? The last thing I remembered was dark spirits taking me away.
Tenzin	You were trapped in the Fog of Lost Souls. And I wasn't going to let you stay there.
Jinora	I'm so happy to see you, Dad.
Bolin	He's got the Light Spirit!
Jinora	The world is in trouble.
Tenzin	What are you talking about? How do you know?
Jinora	I can feel it.
Bumi	What happened?
Jinora	It's Korra.  This light spirit will guide you out of the Spirit World. I have to go help. 
Tenzin	Jinora, wait!
Unavaatu	Now, ten thousand years of darkness begins!
