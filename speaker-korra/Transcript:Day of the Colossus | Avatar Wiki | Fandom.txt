Bolin	 Go ahead, take your time, just bending a giant wall! Man, have we got a lot of people hurt!  Is that everybody?! Gah!
Tenzin	 Kuvira is heading our way, with a platoon of mecha suits!
Asami	What should we do?
Bolin	This is my hometown and I hate to say it, but there's no use risking all our lives to fight that giant thing! Let her take the city for now! We'll think of some way to come back and beat her!
Mako	What about all the people who haven't been evacuated yet? If Kuvira finds out that Wu is with them, she might fire that spirit cannon at him and take them all out.
Korra	I couldn't stop Kuvira from taking Zaofu. I'm not letting her conquer Republic City. The world isn't safe as long as she has that weapon.
Lin	I agree. We take down that giant today.
Korra	Lin!
Lin	 Glad to see you all made it out. You had me worried.
Varrick	Well, you benders are going to have to fight her alone. She just blew up our factory with all our hummingbird suits.
Asami	Not all of them. There are the prototypes back at my office. If we can get those ready to fly, we'll at least be able to offer a little air support.
Korra	Su, you take Baatar Jr. and the rest of the wounded back to Asami's office. Get those suits working as soon as you can. The rest of us will just have to face Kuvira on our own.
Pema	Everyone, please settle down. The trains should be returning to pick us up soon.
Evacuee	 Tell that mecha jerk to settle down. She's the one blowing up the whole city!
Tu	[Jumping up onto the bench behind Pema, pinning her between himself and the conductor; his voice is frantic.] Everyone! I was just up on the observation deck and saw a bunch of mecha suit soldiers heading this way!
Evacuee	Oh great! The giant one wasn't enough?! It's over! We're all gonna get blown to bits!
Wu	Listen everyone, I can get us out of here if you just sit tight.  Can you step off the bench, please? It's a little crowded up here.
Wu	Just stay calm. I'll be right back. [To Tu who follows.] Come on.
Evacuee	 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going?
Wu	 I'm going to get some help.  You think you can handle this unruly mob for a little while?
Pema	 I raised Meelo. I can handle anything.
Meelo	A paint store? That's it! 
Lin	 What are you doing, Meelo?
Meelo	 I just got an idea how to beat the giant. Now, everyone, grab some paint and find me some balloons!
Soldier	Airbenders approaching.
Kuvira	I see them.
Meelo	Bombs away!
Kuvira	Clear the glass!
Tenzin	Now!
Lin	The joints are platinum, too! We can't metalbend any of it!
Bolin	You're about to get the world's largest hot foot, metal lady!
Bolin	Hit it now!
Bolin	 Opal!
Korra	 Everyone retreat! Take the wounded back to Asami's office!
Lin	I'll meet you there! I'm going to see if I can find any help!
Varrick	All right, let's fire it up again!
Asami	I can't stabilize it! I thought you fixed the hydraulics.
Varrick	I did! Twist harder!
Daw	I hope you have something in here that can take out a platoon of mecha suits. Kuvira's troops are headed this way!
Varrick	 I know how to take down some mecha suits and it just might take down that giant, too.  Asami, disconnect anything electrical in here until we get back.  Zhu Li, let's go.
Suyin	Just rest, son. I'm here.
Suyin	I don't know, sweetie. She's a complicated person.
Suyin	Yeah, they might take some time to come around. But we'll work through it as a family.
Varrick	I know I can stop the mecha suits with an electromagnetic pulse, so it stands to reason that I can stop a giant mecha suit with a giant electromagnetic pulse. [Climbs up the tower and cuts some wires on a stand.] Zhu Li, I've been thinking.
Varrick	Yes. But lately, I've been thinking about you. I know we might not make it out of this mess and I feel like there are some things I should tell you.
Varrick	I remember when I was a boy, I had an ostrich horse. Named her Mrs. Beaks. [Zhu Li's excitement dies out and she glares at Varrick.] I grew up on a farm. Did I ever tell you that, Zhu Li? This was before the circus people took me away. Anyway, I loved old Mrs. Beaks, but I took her for granted.
Varrick	Yes! Dead in their tracks. [Sees the giant mecha suit still moving.] Oh, rats. She's still coming. Zhu Li, do the thing!
Kuvira	What was that?
Soldier	An electromagnetic pulse. It shut down the mecha suits, but our power source is fine.
Kuvira	Locate the source of the pulse. That must be where Varrick is. Third and fourth mech platoons, move in and continue the sweep. Capture anyone left in the city.
Bolin	Varrick, how come your electro-thingy shut down the small mecha suits but not the big one?
Hiroshi	It's not.
Asami	 Dad? 
Lin	I got him out of jail to help. I figured we need all the geniuses we can get our hands on right now. If the prison's still standing after all this is over, we can throw him back in.
Hiroshi	I know what you all must think of me, but I love Republic City and I would do anything to save her.
Korra	 You think you know how to defeat this thing?
Hiroshi	You must act like an infection: break the skin and attack its vital organs, disconnect the heart and the brain and this beast cannot live.
Korra	But how are we supposed to get inside?
Hiroshi	Future Industries has plasma saws for cutting platinum. If we had one on the mecha suit ...
Asami	But the saws are way too big. We'd never get the suits off the ground.
Hiroshi	I think I can add an electrical element to the welding torch on your suit and convert it into a plasma saw. Then we'll just have to land on the giant and cut open a hole big enough for someone to get in.
Asami	Like a metal mosquito.
Varrick	You know what happens to mosquitoes that land on me? I squash 'em!
Korra	We'll have to attack in a swarm to try to keep you guys safe in the hummingbird suits. It looks like they're our only hope.
Pema	Oh, first he ate the fruit, then he ate the leaves. Hungry little lemur, ate up all my trees.  Okay, great job everybody. Who's got another song for us?
Evacuee	 We can't just sit around here singing old airbender songs until we're all captured, or worse.
Pema	Should we play the button game? Who has a button?
Pema	Where do these badgermoles come from?
Wu	The zoo! Mako always hated my singing, but they love it!
Evacuee	Well, what are we supposed to do with badgermoles?
Wu	They're the best earthbenders around! We can use them to tunnel out of the city without Kuvira's troops spotting us.
Evacuee	Are you sure this is the best plan?  Let's follow the moles!
Wu	 Badgermoles, digging holes, under Republic City. Got to run away from Kuvira today, although I do still think she's pretty.
Kuvira	Mech platoons, report.
Fourth platoon	Fourth platoon, en route to train station.
Soldier	I think we found the source of the electromagnetic pulse:  Future Industries Tower.
Kuvira	That's the place.
Daw	Kuvira is headed our way!
Korra	 How long will it take to get the plasma saws ready?
Asami	Just a few more minutes.
Korra	Get out there as soon as you can.
Korra	Thanks. [To group.] We may not be able to beat that thing, but we can slow it down. Let's go!
Tenzin	Jinora!
Wu	 Oh, Yin, you're the sweetest evacuee I've ever known.  And I just want to thank you for being so kind, when I was living in your home.
Wu	You don't need these people. They're just innocent civilians caught in the crossfire, but I'm Prince Wu, rightful leader of the Earth Kingdom. [Outstretches his hands.] Take me to Kuvira. I've got business with her.
Tu	No! Don't do it, Wu.
Wu	I have to. But before I go,  I'd like to sing you a song.  If you don't respect the broach, you don't respect me. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You're no better than a roach,  but I'm royalty. I got my badgermoles with me.
Wu	[Singing.] You don't know what you're talking about. [The badgermoles land on the mecha suits, crushing them.] Oh, badgermoles I love you, I love you. I want to, I want to pet your snouts. [Laughs, as the evacuees cheer him on.]
Asami	If we stop that mecha giant, it will all be because of you.
Hiroshi	You're the one who designed these incredible suits.  It's great to be working together again.
Asami	I love you, Dad.
Hiroshi	I love you, too.
Varrick	Zhu Li?
Varrick	[Getting nervous.] I have something I need to attach before we take off.
Varrick	[Takes out a small purple box.] I need to attach this ring [Kneels down and opens the box, revealing a green ring.] to your finger. Zhu Li Moon, will you do the thing for the rest of our lives?
Varrick	[Triumphantly stands up.] Yes! [Puts the ring to Zhu Li's finger, before carrying and kissing her.] Now let's go attach these barely functional rust buckets to a giant killer smashing machine!
Varrick	Aim for that spot in the middle of the back - the one I can never reach.
Varrick	Wah, let's get out of here! [Zhu Li steers the suit, narrowly avoiding being crushed.] Wow! I wish I had that kind of flexibility.
Kuvira	I need more power! They're cutting in! More power!
Asami	We need to get out of here.
Hiroshi	Almost there.
Asami	 We have to go now!
Hiroshi	 Almost there. Almost there!
Asami	 Dad! Now!
Hiroshi	Goodbye, Asami. I love you. 
Asami	 Dad!
Korra	Hiroshi's plan worked. There's our opening.
